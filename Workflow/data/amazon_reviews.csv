1,"I bought this item recently, and amazon had a great price on a pack of 12.<br />Boyardee products are usually ok. I wish I had bought a single can of this<br />and tried it before I bought the case.<br /><br />It said ""pasta and meatballs in a tomato sauce"" - I think they forgot to<br />put the tomatoes in the sauce. Didn't taste anything like tomatoes. Wasn't<br />even the right color (not red). Yes, it was definitely before the ""best by"" date.<br /><br />Maybe I was expecting too much, but this was absolutely HORRIBLE.<br />I wish I could truly express my sincere dislike of this product.<br /><br />If I could give this product zero stars, I would."
1,"This product completely dissapointed me. Im doing the lemonade diet and i was looking so foward to this maple syrup sweeting my lemonade but boy was i wrong. as soon as i tried it tasted horrible. you get such a nasty after taste. i would never buy this again"
1,"I am a true lover of hot chocolate and this chocolate is not that great.  The taste is flat and does not taste that chocolaty.  I was truly disaapointed so I shared it with a co-worker and she stated that she did not like it either.  Her exact words were, ""This has a unusual taste...not good""."
1,"After 40 years of taking many brands of Brewers yeast regularly and recommending it to anyone who would listen, I never expected to find a forumlation that is comletely unpalatable. The taste of this brand is so foul, the manufacturer should be ashamed to put their label on it!"
1,"Why, why, why did they change the formula??  Our twins loved this.  Now just like gobble gobble, they wont take it.<br /><br />Company's website with the old and new formula: [..]<br /><br />Only guess is that sweet potato is much more expensive than corn (both the top ingredients).<br /><br />Wrote to happybaby to tell them how disappointed we are"
1,"This is some kind of a joke, right?<br /><br />Is this REALLY a $60 5 pound bag of flour? LOLOLOLOL<br /><br />Only in America!"
1,"I love the lime/chili flavor combo, bought this popcorn thinking it would satisfy my craving. I was wrong. The popcorn has a faint lime/chili taste and smells awful. In addition for the 5 bucks total with shipping, you only get 1 bag. Actually for that I should be thankful because now I don't have to throw out 15 bags of b.o."
1,"As a Philadelphia resident I thought this would be a good item for Halloween distribution so I ordered 2 packs which should have been 24 total dispensers.  When I received the package I received only two dispensers, not the two packs.  The good news is Amazon's coustomer service was excellent.  Once they realized the error they promptly refunded my purchase price.  I was disappointed about not receiving the full order but recognize mistakes are made.  A prompt and courteous response with an good resolution is a positive for me."
1,"I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.<br /><br />I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet, the quarter slice of lemon that I bit into was only slightly sweet... MY son said it tasted like lemonade. It did sort of taste like lemonade - more sour than sweet.  After that the effect pretty much was unnoticeable. I tried it again tonight with some raspberries and sour cherries. I tasted no difference, other than that of the strange lingering after-taste that the tablet leaves behind.<br /><br />Another person mentioned having tasted tea after dissolving a tablet on the tongue. Like that person, I did notice a difference but did not really care for the taste. More like an artificial sweetener than like sugar. My son and I were very disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />[...]"
1,"saltyness may be the ""norm"" for products like this, but it doesnt mean i have to like it. its probably healthier than a ""slim-jim"", but i still wont order again because it contains lots of milligrams of unhealthy salt, and it tastes extremely salty. better have a gallon of water nearby to go with it,if you want to try eating these.i hope they can try making a lower sodium version of this some day.."
1,"I should have known better than to order canned stir-fry vegetables.  These poor veggies just hang limp on the fork (or spoon, whatever).  They have no flavor whatsoever.  Now I'm stuck with 7 cans of useless, tasteless ""stuff.""<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005927YHG"">Tiger Tiger Stir Fry Vegetables, 15-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />Marilyn"
1,"I couldn't figure out why it was not working well from the day I received it.  I found a large crack in the side of the pump.  I am going to try to return it but it seems that if it is not sold by amazon I will not be able to exchange the product.  Very disappointed!"
1,"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?"
1,"I was very excited to find a lactose friendly ice cream that was a different flavor other than vanilla. However, this is not even close to tasting like ice cream. It has an extremely strange texture and the taste is disgusting. I tried to give it a chance, but after 5 spoonfuls, I threw out the entire pint. $5 down the drain, but that's better than the torture of ingesting this ""ice cream"". You are better off buying a soy based ice cream. These are actually very good, as long as you are used to the taste of soy, and the consistency is just like ice cream. Word to the wise, don't buy this! It's not worth the money or disappointment."
1,"I really thought the reviews were mixed because some people just don't like coconut water, so I ordered this.  It is NOT good at all.  In fact it has weird smell to it.  It is in my refrigerator, but I think I will have to throw them all away as I cannot get myself to drink it.  I did drink 1/2 of one mixed with orange juice and it didn't taste bad, but just thinking about that weird smell makes me not want to drink any more of it.<br /><br />I have bought other Vita Coco Coconut Water in the past and loved every one of them.  I should have passed on this one.  It really isn't drinkable, in my opinion."
1,"I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.<br /><br />The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better."
1,"I no longer will buy anything Kelloggs makes because they refuse to label their products when they contain GMOs. Not only that, they are spending lots of $$$$ to keep Americans (they label in the UK and Europe) in the dark about their ingredients. I support Yes on Prop 37. I want to know what I am feeding my family. Google - Kelloggs spends money to defeat Prop 37."
1,"I purchased a 16 oz. jar of this product from the same company.  I would suggest that anyone considering buying this product read my review under the 16 oz. jar listing.  The same comments would apply to this large jar, except you would be stuck with twice as much."
1,"My cat developed crystals in his urine after he began eating this food.  He always eats high-quality dry food, such as Wellness, and he wasn't under any stress, so I believe that switching to this food caused the condition.  I took him off of this and put him back on Wellness dry food, and without any other changes in his diet or environment, the crystals went away after about two weeks.  Sure enough, I later contacted Diamond and they informed me that the ash content in this dry food is 8.8%, and the magnesium = .10%.  The lower the ash content, the higher the quality of the meat is.  To give you an idea of what an acceptable amount in dry food is, Wellness contains 6.5%.  I would stay away from Diamond Naturals if you have a male cat."
1,"Ingredients from the Nutrition Facts Panel: Beef, Water, Corn Syrup, Salt, Sugar, Hydrolyzed Soya Protein, Dehydradrated Garlic, Paprika, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, Spices, SODIUM ERTHYORBATE, Spice Extractives, SODIUM NITRITE.<br /><br />If you like chemical preservatives, MSG and Corn Syrup, then this is the jerky for you...<br /><br />Status: Returned."
1,"I was giddy with glee when I ordered this tea, but when I received it, I was taken aback at its potency. (It truly smelled like potpourri.)<br />I recommend that if you are bothered by strong scents that you do not purchase this product."
1,"This stuff is garbage!!<br /><br />If you don't believe me, then try them and watch your teeth do all the talking!!<br /><br />1 star."
1,"The title decieves. It's not natural. It's sugar free maple syrup. Which, at that point, is pretty gross."
1,"I love Cashews, but this product SUCKED! It had too much Pepper. I washed them off and put them in the toaster oven to freshen them up. Now they are semi descent."
1,"I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a ""Low glycemic"" food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption."
1,"I guess you get what you pay for... I thought I'd give this a try since it's cheaper than the big-name cider K-cups, but it was a waste of money.  I would hardly even call it cider.  It has a very weak cider flavor, but a sickeningly strong artificial sweetener flavor.  It really tastes bitter and leaves a bad aftertaste.  I hate to throw things away, so I guess I'll save the rest of the K-cups for sometime when I'm really desperate!  Would definitely not buy again!"
1,"Another non-diet food with artificial sweetener.  I tasted the bitterness of the sucralose, checked the label and sure enough,it was there at the end.  The first ingredient is SUGAR, why ruin it?  Skip this unless you're not on a diet, love sucralose, and not a chocolate lover.  Gross."
1,"Cats are carnivores.<br /><br />Science Diet has no meat.<br /><br />Instead, you get cheap corn filler, spent rice leftover from brewing beer, and meatless chicken parts that humans don't eat, like beaks."
1,"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame."
1,"...but these taste like cardboard. The texture is reminiscent of cardboard too. I grew up loving ginger snaps and when our go-to brand was no longer available at our grocery store, we gave these a try. Needless to say, I soon stopped eating ginger snaps. They are hard as rocks out of the box, yet when they get stale you can bend them almost in half before they fall apart. Stay away. I just picked up a different brand after all these years and now I'm reminded what I've been missing."
1,"This rice tastes like dirt. I love brown basmati rice, but wow was I disappointed. It literally tastes like steamed gobs of dirt. It reminds me of Mahatma rice, which I absolutely hate since it tasted like dirt too. I'm going to try a different brand."
1,"The initial taste does hint of black cherry, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after-taste.  It has a slight metallic taste and is not very pleasant.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation."
1,"My prior two failed traps: the WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets and the Victor Poison-Free M370 Yellow Jacket Magnet Disposable Bag Trap both ended without success and both left me red and swollen.  Once I was able to move again I took a trip to the hardware store and purchased the Safer Brand Deluxe Yellow Jacket/Wasp Trap, since it was the only product on the shelf that I had not purchased.<br /><br />Strike three!  This thing didn't work for me either.  I followed the instructions and filled it with grape juice (apple didn't work in previous attempts) and set the bait up.  I gotta say, of the three traps I used, this one has the stinkiest bait.  I hung it on a tree and waited three weeks.<br /><br />After three weeks I checked it and nothing, NOTHING was floating in this little plastic coffin.  I was so mad that I took a baseball bat and knocked the trap right off of my tree, spraying my grill with bait.  If you've read my other reviews, then I'm sure you know what follows next....<br /><br />Yup, raccoon attack.  I know, completely predictable right?  Unfortunately for me, I like to have a midnight burger.  Meat in hand, I sauntered out to the grill at 10 past midnight.  I felt confident that, since it was night time, and wasps are not active at night, that I could use the grill despite not having washed the bait off.  I popped the top of the grill and was confronted by a 20 pound raccoon, no wait, it must have been a 300 pound mutant raccoon... yeah, that's it....  I dropped my meat and turned to run.  As I sprinted right into my reinforced sliding glass door (I bounced off of it) the raccoon reared up and launched itself at me.  Before a passed out I saw its little beady eyes peering down at me.<br /><br />I woke up the next morning completely naked and covered in raw meat.  My wife claims that there was no raccoon, and that I was acting out some strange fantasy... but I know the truth..."
1,"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog."
1,"Don't be fooled.  This is not teavana tea. A waste of $48.  Hopefully Teavana will bring back their popular tea soon.  Until then I am going back to coffee"
1,"Hard, tough, pasty aftertaste. Like gnawing on a rubber hose but with a less pleasant flavor. Somewhere in the back of that just woke up in the morning and scraped it off your teeth taste there was a lingering strawberryish flavor. An unripe and turned slightly bad strawberryish flavor with not a hint of sweetness. These were awful. So bad I couldn't swallow the bite I took. It was such a disappointment since I was really excited to get these after Runningrabbit stopped making the good stuff. If I fed these to my kids they would report me to CPS. I want to pull them out of the package and whip the CEO with them as punishment. If I'd never had candy in my life these would still taste terrible! Did I mention they aren't good.? Seriously, if you are looking for something that tastes anything like a red vine or any type of licorice this isn't it."
1,"Unfortunately, when my sugar arrived each package felt as hard as a brick. I opened one package and had to chip at it to obtain a few crumbs of sugar.  This is the first item ordered that I have had a problem with.  I emailed Amazon customer service, and they promptly sent a refund.  Thank you to Amazon for great customer service."
1,"This product was described as ""Medium Roast Sampler, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"" but contained over 50% extra bold...no return available....complete waste"
1,"I found these to be a bit too sour and they leave a bad after taste in my mouth.  Also they have a slimy film.  I would not recommend."
1,"I ordered the Sea Salt and Vinegar 1.5 ounce packs and received Sea Salt ones instead. A little disappointed, though I like the Sea Salt flavor ones - but I wanted to try the Vinegar version1"
1,"Smells and tastes like true jet fuel.  Absolutely disgusting!  I would not ever dare to pay for a cup of this nastiness!"
1,"Pros: Low Cal. Cons: Hardly any flavor. Seriously, I taste nothing but ""puff"". They get stale fast, and the bag always tears when opening. Always! Very annoying. Sorry, if you want cheddar flavor, look elsewhere. These remind me of rice crackers."
1,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and customer service from this company (Barry Farm). It says on the page for this product ""Usually ships within 6 to 10 days"". I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt, ordering it so it would be delivered on a day I was home. This effort failed; the shipping and delivery dates changed...twice. I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo. But the interesting thing was, it was evident that the product had melted before, re-hardened, and then began to melt again in my mailbox. Due care was not taken to package the product in a manner that MAY have helped prevent such damage. I will not be ordering from this company again."
1,"I love these things. They are easy and you get a good amount of lean protein. However, the last two shipments have been dry. This is in stark contrast to the juicy and fresh ones that I have been getting for quite some time. I'm disappointed, and thinking of discontinuing my orders."
1,"I used the FRS powder for several months and had to stop using it because it caused stomach problems. I was using one or two packets per day (less than the recommended amount) and I even tried diluting it more than recommended to make it less strong/concentrated, but it still caused problems. The problems went away when I stopped drinking it.  While I like the taste and the convenience of the powder packets, it's not worth the gastric disturbance."
1,"I was just about to buy this, until I saw in the ingredients that it contains MSG. At least this product description tells you (the others don't). If you are like me, that means you'll get a nasty headache after eating this. How about offering MSG-free noodles like I can get locally?"
1,"I recently learned Waggin' Train, Canyon Creek and Milo's Kitchen treats are being investigated by the FDA after more than 1,000 dog deaths related to kidney failure were reported.  Please be very careful to read every detail of the treats you give your dog!  Their lives can depend on it.<br /><br />I lost my little 2-year-old sheltie to kidney failure within 2 weeks of diagnosis.  I had been very careful about the food and treats I gave her; reading the nutritional analysis, ingredients, etc.  I only gave her human grade products and thought these were ""natural"" and ""wholesome"". I didn't see the small print on the bag saying these were made in China. Her early death was a huge shock to us.  And to see that there is a link to her cause of death and the treats I gave her breaks my heart.  Please be very, very careful with these products.<br /><br />[...]"
1,"I received my order promptly and as promised yesterday.  My order included a hotair popcorn maker as well as a 4 pound container of Snappy Yellow Popcorn.  I was so excited when I received my order that I quickly opened the box and popped up my first big bowl of popcorn and boy was that a disappointment.  The new popcorn maker worked perfectly but the Snappy popcorn is stale.  I don't normally like to complain but the product was pretty bad.  On a good note, the popcorn pops up big, fluffy, and yellow.  If the popcorn wasn't stale it would probably be quite tasty.  There is no expiration date on the plastic container so I'm not sure if I possibly received a bad container. Perhaps if the container had plastic wrap around the lid or across the top under the lid it would keep the popcorn kernels fresh.  I haven't decided whether I should return the Snappy popcorn container or not but I wanted let others to know. Perhaps it is my fault because I didn't read the specific reviews to include the high and low ratings of this popcorn.  I just saw the overall rating of the popcorn was quite highly rated and highly recommended. My advice, read the reviews (good and bad)."
1,"i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place. I dont know what to do with the whole 4 box, i wasnt even able to drink up the one single cup!"
1,"To prefix, I will eat almost anything, dried squid jerky, octopus served in its ink, sesame and seaweed Chinese candy (unleaded), intense ginger candy, and strange sea creatures that are squishy. Pulparindo and other Mexican salt candies must require some kind of tongue that I was not born with.  It causes my brain to do flips, not comprehending what I am eating.  Is it a salty snack, or is it candy?  These are two worlds that should not come together.  What next, pork Jolly Ranchers, or shrimp Jelly Bellies?"
1,"This entire line of products are crap!  They are not real coffee, but instant.  Do not waste your money.  You can get a better product at ANY dollar store."
1,"A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has ""vegetarian spices"" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever."
1,"Out of the four blends of Starbucks coffee I have purchased and tried, this is by far the worst. Super bitter with a complementary disgusting after taste."
1,"We thought this was the sausage cabellas sold during the holidays, but there was nothing merry about my purchase. It made my wife and oldest son sick to there stomachs and throw up. We had to throw out the rest."
1,"Tried making this pizza crust but it just never got off the ground. I mixxed it in my bread machine and when I dumped it out it was too runnny to work with. Sticky dough on the floured board, sticky dough on my hands, sticky dough still in the bread machine pan. (Runny dough too). I added more gf flour, at least 6 times totaling over 2 cups and then gave up. We have been spoiled by Kinnickinnicks premade pizza crusts. I will try the Arrowhead mix 1 more but what a nightmare!"
1,"I have enjoyed Starbucks Via on several camping trips - what a life saver!  Recently someone gave me the Mocha flavored Via to try, apparently because they could not stand the taste after one sip.  Well I thought perhaps they were just too haughty, and I offered to take the rest.  I finally tried one last night, and now I know why it was given away by the previous taster.<br /><br />The Mocha flavored Via is disgusting.  Rather than having any flavor of chocolate at all, it has a strong artificial sweetener taste - as if someone dumped in a package of saccharine and called it cocoa.  It ruins what would otherwise be a usable cup of coffee.  Far superior is using the regular or Columbia flavored Via, and adding a few small squares of real Hersheys chocolate!"
1,"25 SCARLET / CAROLINA RED MAPLE TREE Acer Rubrum Seeds<br /><br />THEY ALL DIED ON ME!! WELL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN!!"
1,"My family was very disappointed with this drink. We were surprised because we have always enjoyed Arizona Iced Tea. But as a mix with the Pomegranate and Green Tea, this drink tasted like a weak solution of grape lollipops. I think that you should mix the drink with less water than the container calls for and the taste will be more like  Pomegranate."
1,"I ate these with hummus... they turned my stomach. Thinking it might've been the hummus, I tried these again on another day... no good. I thought they'd be a great alternative to Ritz or other crackers... They were not. Very hard. Had a weird aftertase. Yuck."
1,"It never ceases to amaze me that you Brits eat this horrific dog food-paste.<br /><br />No wonder you lost the revolutionary war.<br /><br />It's clear from you eating Marmite and Vegamite that you never deserved those colonies anyway."
1,"This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.  As a result, when the K-cup is punctured by the Keurig coffee maker, the foil lid separates from the side of the k-cup, resulting in an explosion of coffee grounds in the coffee maker.  Only 1 of 3 k-cups did not do this.  It is specifically this brand/packaging, since I was making other varieties of k-cup coffee in the same coffee maker in the same time and none of those broke the seal and left grounds all in the coffee maker.<br />Looking at the seal on this product, compared to other K-cups varieties, this seal is MUCH tighter, and since there is a larger amount of coffee grounds in this k-cup, there's a lot more to make a mess!<br />Loved the taste of the coffee, but can't waste so much time cleaning up the coffee pot!  Don't buy in the Amazon hassle-free packaging, you'll be sorry!"
1,"Love the laffy taffy.  But when I received this product, all of the protective plastic sealing was torn open (it actually looked torn open by a person as opposed to pressure breaking the seal).  Did not feel comfortable eating the product.  However, Amazon was great at quickly processing a refund.  I ended up buying the same product at the local Smart and Final for $4 less (around $9.00).  So the price of this product is much higher than it should be."
1,"I paid a much higher price for these plants, thinking I would get the best.  What was received was a can telling how to sow the seeds til they sprouted.  And, they have not sprouted yet.  This company advertised PLANTS, and send SEEDS"
1,"I've been trying to lose weight and eat a healthy diet, so I bought this along with some other products a couple of weeks ago because I was going to add this to things like popcorn and vegetables since the description said this had a cheesy flavor; plus I could use the extra fiber.  The day after I received this, I put some on my air popped popcorn and took it to work with me.  I ate a couple of pieces and ended up throwing the bag out.  I'm not really sure how to describe the taste, but it's definitely not a cheese like flavor.  I didn't like it at all."
1,"I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar."
1,"My recommendation is to stick with the k-cups that are NOT instant coffee.  For a few more bucks you can get REAL coffee k-cups and flavoured ones as well.  I won't be buying this product again."
1,"I must have gotten hold of a bad batch.  The other two reviewers loved it.  How to describe it...kind of think about washing your white load and then drinking the water before the spin/rinse cycle.  There was no garlic, no flavor at all, except for what I can only describe as disgusting.  The bottles went in the trash.  If there was a zero star option, I would have chosen it.  Sorry to disappoint."
1,"I tasted these for the first time today...  I am not a picky person, but this bar caused me to gag and I needed to rub the excess of this bar off with a nearby napkin. It really reminded my of acidy vomit."
1,"This is ridiculous! You are not SAVING $15.00, you are spending at least $5.00 MORE than you should be! The highest price for a 9oz. individual can in my area is $4.49 (I know, yikes!), so 27oz. would cost me around $14.00...why would I want to spend MORE MONEY?!? Thanks for wasting time- I'm obviously not going to find any savings from this company."
1,"Well executed but cloying and saccharine.<br /><br />""The Cross"" was an instrument of torture, and at the end the deposition it was coated with blood and excrement.<br /><br />Hard for me to swallow it as a cookie, but then again some folks ""Christianity"" begins and ends in sentiment."
1,"What I normally think of when I see candy rocks is a hard chocolate shell over a chocolate center.  Additionally, the product description includes the phrase ""Products are manufactured in a facility that processes tree nuts/peanuts, dairy wheat and soy products."" What it doesn't say is that the product CONTAINS tree nuts, jelly beans and who knows what else.  And this is a Kosher product! Likewise the manufacturer site does not mention the additional contents of this product.  Add to that, the nuts tasted somewhere between stale and fowl.<br /><br />I certainly will not purchase another product from Koppers unless I can taste it first.<br /><br />I called customer service, got a refund and threw the remaining 4.5 pounds in the trash."
1,"When I bought the small bag in the store, it was great. After I bought the 5lbs bag, not anymore. It is hard and taste like other gummi candies. I felt cheated. I was looking forward to receiving it, now I don't even want to eat it. They must have shipped an old bag to me. Probably won't buy from them again. At least not food."
1,"Oops!  I purchased this product thinking it was a white chocolate or at least some kind of chocolate flavor. Boy was I wrong.  Way over the top sweet.  I have been giving it away to unsuspecting friends and relatives, but don't tell them I hate it.  Never again...."
1,"We ordered the mango flavor margherita mix - but they sent us a case of regular flavor. NOT MANGO. Amazon is great about exchanging so I don't anticipate a problem, but not happy I sent this as a gift and didn't realize until recently that they had sent the wrong kind."
1,"The cans arrived all banged up.  I will never order from this company again."
1,"this is the worst coconut water i ever had.  my tongue still burns from whatever impurities are in this.  we are from the tropics, know fresh pure coconut water, but this should not even be on the market.  it had a sour chemical taste.  unfortunately, i did not know you cannot return this.  i do hope i get a refund."
1,"This was sent with absolutely no protective packaging. The contents of every can arrived smashed to bits. I would give 0 stars if possible. To top it off this is a non-returnable item.<br />Boo, Amazon."
1,"Why does JR Specialties attempt to trick young,gullible, aspiring chefs to use this cheap ARTIFICIAL oil?<br />DO your research- truffle oil is not natural JR, so that piece of info should  be included under PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.<br />At least when people pay for the crap you are selling, they should bw aware that it's crap and not some<br />european made high-end truffle oil!"
1,"My two cats did not like this stuff at all. I thought I would treat them to a more pricey organic food and they would love me for it...not so...one looked at me like I was nuts...she wouldn't go near it, the other gave it a try and barfed right in the bowl. The chicken and brown rice had a very fishy smell, not good. Sorry Paul, great dressings but the cats give you a thumbs down."
1,"The offer here is very clear, especially with the note that ""You save $42.81."" Yet when I went to order, I called PETCO first and they told me they are aware of the problem, have received complaints but have done nothing about it. The price advertised is for 5 patties only. This is false and deceptive advertising."
1,"I was excited to get the Lickety Stik for my dogs. It sounds like a good idea BUT the roller part DOES NOT roll and in order for the dog to get something to taste you must squeeze the container which can be a mess. I have four dogs, as I dog train in obedience and in tracking. In the beginning all four were interested, but then they all became frustrated with it. I ended up with $25.00 of this garbage. SAVE YOR MONEY.it's not worth it!"
1,"It took over a month to arrive and then three of the four jars arrived opened. It was such an oily mess that I won't bother to return. I can't comment on the fourth as I don't want to take chances eating it and getting sick."
1,"I, too, was fooled onto thinking these were filter packs. Not what I expected, or wanted at all.<br />Not worth the time and expense to return.<br />Not happy."
1,"We love Happy Baby products - cereals, puffs, yogurt melts, all the baby food - EXCEPT Gobble Gobble. Even my 3 year old choked on this. It really ticked me off when my 1 year old choked too! It is EXTREMELY dry and thick and lumpy. I cannot believe Happy Baby manufacturers and sells this stuff, and I can't believe retailers stock it. DO NOT BUY!"
1,"I've had this variety of tea from other sources, so I have an idea what it should taste like.  When I opened the bag, my nose was assaulted by a strong smell of turpentine - I thought it was the packaging, so I moved it into a plastic storage tub.  The brewed tea tasted equally of turpentine.  I did find that if you leave the tea out in the air, the taste and smell dissipates, but keeping it for any length of time in a closed container causes the turpentine taste/smell to return.  Even aerated, the tea has a very grassy taste to it.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will not buy a Numi tea again after this bad experience."
1,"The service was fast and as promised. Unfortunately, the Biscotti was broken into very small pieces, with very few pieces intact.The product was padded at both ENDS of the box, but not the sides, and had obviously been mishandled. Sorry, but I would not risk buying this product by mail order again."
1,"I had a cup of this at a friend's home, and he asked me if I liked it. I told him frankly that it wasn't great; it tasted too much like instant coffee. He said that it WAS instant! Conclusion: It is anathema to use a K-Cup brewer to make INSTANT anything. And at 50 cents (minimum) per cup, it's got to be the height of misplaced convenience. There are wonderful flavored coffee K-Cup varieties out there -- try them."
1,"The Licorice spice tea is fragrant and delicious.<br />I was given some to try, and was so excited about this tea. I added it to my amazon.com<br />subscriptions. Several days later I mentioned this tea to my Doctor. He gave me a<br />strict warning against ANY kind od black Licorice.<br />This tea and all black licorice products need clearly posted warnings.<br />Not for consumption by anyone with high Blood pressure, or on blood pressure medicines.<br />The package had not yet arrived, I contacted amazon for return instructions and was told it is not return or refundable!  Very unhappy  :(<br />Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
1,"My husband and I both think this looks like and tastes like dog food. We were very sad and couldn't even eat more than one nugget size bite. We wish we had a way to return it! What a waste of money."
1,"We spent a few weeks in Morocco last year and bought ras el hanout in six different places--in Fez, Marrakesh, Rabat, and Meknes, at spice stands and supermarkets. The name means ""head of the shop""--it's a blend of up to 100 spices and every place has a slightly different formula. With all six, we got a mild, aromatic, subtly perfumy seasoning with a tremendous depth of flavor. We love it on steamed lamb shanks. It has an outstanding affinity for whole roast chicken: brush melted butter all over the chicken, then coat generously with ras el hanout and a little salt and pepper. Roast at 365° for 1 hour and 45 minutes, turning it over after the first hour. Fabulous! Ras el hanout is about the same color as cumin. (See the article in Wikipedia for info on the main ingredients.)<br /><br />We were sorry to find out that this product is nothing like the real deal. We bought it because our Morocco stash is running out. It looks and tastes like ordinary curry powder, including a fair amount of hot chili pepper, not at all like ras el hanout. We threw it out. Don't waste your money."
1,"It has too much raspberry flavor.  Tone it down.  I love raspberry chocolate but I would not buy another bag of your m&ms.  Sorry."
1,"Don't be fooled by ""sugar free"".  This product is very high in carbs (17g per tablespoon)!  If your diabetic be sure to buy the carb smart product."
1,"I placed an order with Amazon for these berries, when the package came the berries were Rotten. They were soft, sprouting and had some mold. I called Amazon who immediately sent out a new package. However, that package was also moldy and sprouting. Amazon was great about giving me a refund without any questions - but it still leaves me without any berries."
1,"She is showing the original Sweetheart Candies and sent out the New ones that I didn't want. I am so angry.<br />Bait and switch.  The only reason I bought them because it shows the ones I wanted. Lies."
1,"I am pretty sensitive to caffeine so I was a bit nervous about taking this stuff. If I drink coffee or tea on an empty stomach I tend to get the heebie-jeebies. I drank a full bottle and didn't really feel anything. Nothing good and nothing bad. I took the berry flavor and it wasn't that bad at all. I think I'll stick to some strong Irish tea."
1,"I purchased these pods to try with my Nespresso CitiZ. The flavor is decent, though less creamy than Nespresso, which I expected. The main problem is that the pods themselves don't function well in the machine. They get stuck and I have to use needle-nose pliers to pry them out of the machine. Additionally, the water isn't able to fully penetrate the pod and through the paper cover, so the espresso flows nicely for the first 5 seconds...then slows to a drip. After extracting the pods with the pliers, I can clearly see the center of the cover of the pod is not wet. On the Lungo setting, it takes 3 pods to generate the same quantity of coffee 1 original Nespresso pod creates.<br /><br />I do not recommend using these pods with the Nespresso CitiZ. If you decide to try, order just one unit of 5 boxes and give it a try - because they are not returnable, even if unopened and in the airtight packaging. I'm now stuck with 100 extra pods that will go to waste. Learn from my mistake!"
1,"If you like the greaseball look, such as was popular waaaaaay back when, you can achieve that by getting a jar of this super grease from Clear. I got it because I have been using Clear shampoo which is a very good product and I expected this to be good for my hair and scalp as well. I figured that after a Clear shampoo I could just slap a dab of this Clear Balm and my hair would be more manageable and my scalp would benefit from the alleged ""Therapy"". Not so. This stuff is monumentally greasy. Once applied it defies all removal efforts for weeks. I will addmit that my use of this grease was not aided by any type of instruction, suggestion or comments from the maker. Nor was it packaged in any type of box or carton that might have some type of usage assistance printed on the sides. Nope, just a simple jar of ultimate grease. It does have one attribute in its favor and that is the odor. Not bad at all.<br /><br />Since I am not fool enough to use this on my hair again I tried to find a practical use for it. Recently I had a new garage door installed. The hinges made some noise during opening and closing. The installer said that they would be noisy just during the break-in period and that I should keep the hinges lubricated. I loaded the Clear grease into my grease gun and gave the hinges a shot of this amazing lubricant. My door is much quieter now and, as an unexpected additional benefit, it smells great. Useful and inexpensive - what a deal!"
1,"Used to be an excellent brand and my cat's favorite. Over time, quality declined, and recently, I find several large (close to 1 inch sometimes) fish bones in most cans. Very dangerous to a small animal like a cat especially given how excited they can be when eating, not paying attention to it. I am now picking through each can with a tooth pick for a couple minutes and cleaning bones out before I feed the cat (is that your idea of feeding?), and once i'm out of those, I will not buy them again.<br /><br />If I learn of any future improvement, I will update the review and score."
1,"I don't recommend this product. They advertise ""Extract"" but it isn't. No where on the product does it say ""Extract""<br />In an eight drop serving it has 15mg of Stevia<br />In a five drop serving of Extract there is 200mg<br />There also is some grapefruit seed extract in the product that can add to the after taste as well as the bitterness if you use too much.<br />I get 236 servings out of a 2oz bottle of another product and there is 250 servings from a 3.3oz bottle. Where is the saving. It's just not worth it. OH, BTW, this swill cannot be returned even if it was not opened.<br /><br />GK"
1,"The White Cheddar Has No Taste. I am not sure why I keep trying out new things, but I do. These cheese puffs taste plain with a bit of sour cream dip. They are extremely oily and fattening.<br /><br />I liked the originals, but I do not think I will order from Barbara's Bakery anymore. It is owned by a state-owned chinese company called Bright Foods based in Shanghai. Do your research. Barbara's Bakery is owned by Weetabix Limited which is owned by the Chinese government. No wonder why the quality of Barbara's Bakery has gone down hill."
1,"This product, I love !!  However, the product pictured on Amazon showed a package of 12 Large Greenies for $14.99 and what arrived was a package of 8.  That price I can beat at several of my pet stores.  I had ordered 3 packages based on the 12 Large/$14.99 and since they weren't as advertised, sent all 3 back."
1,"They do  not even look like the picture that is stated on Amazon.  They are not shiny and do not look like pearls.  Dull looking and won't order ever again.  I am doing wedding cupcakes and very disappointed."
1,"When I picked up the package it sounded like a raffle box, but instead of tickets they are cans. When opened, I was shocked that they would use a box that's twice the size of what is needed, without even the stuffing air bags. Over half of the cans are dented, the ones you would discard while selecting them in a grocery store.<br /><br />I never had a problem ordering anything on Amazon before, whether they're books or grocery. This one is very disappointing. I felt like they went to a grocery store, filled some random box with unwanted, dented, and old canned soups. I will reconsider when ordering something like this next time."
1,"i ordered the ""people usually buy"" items package: swirl chocolate seashells, pearl seasheels and starfish  - 2 out ofthe 3 look wonderful - however, the largest item and the one to be used on the bridal shower cake - the large starfish arrived broken.  not sure if seller will replace."
1,"I don't know from what planet these guys are from but the honey arrives in tiny jars that are not even sealed... and the lid comes of very easy (just to make things worse). As far as I am concerned, they can put inside whatever they want - there is no way to prove that the contents is the intended one or if it ever was in France (as they claim). 100% pure junk!<br /><br />As the jars are not even sealed, they might add poison as well or spit in your honey - just for the kicks of it! Why would anyone in his right mind expose him/herself or the family to such low class, dangerous product?!"
1,"Look, just don't even bother.  This is not real jerk sauce.  This is some sweet sugar sauce with a few peppers thrown in to make it seem like jerk sauce.  Trust me.  Unless you can't handle ANY heat, don't bother.<br /><br />I did make one decent dish with this sauce.  I covered ribs with the sauce and baked them for an hour, and they tasted great, but more like a sweet BBQ not a spicy jerk flavor.  This just isn't right."
1,"wiley wallaby offers a variety of australian style liquorices.  the liquorice is soft and chewy.  i've not tried all the various flavors, but the watermelon is not very good.  4 out of the first 5 listed ingredients are sugar, corn syrup, and cane syrup.  also of course is the red dyes #3 and #40.  31 carbs is pretty high also.  in all, i won't be buying this particular liquorice again."
1,"Had to buy another box of the same thing at Petsmart. She eats those.  Must not be fresh.  How can you tell when they look the same."
1,"Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are very<br />tasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram"
1,"I don't know how long the product sat on the shelf, but the windee rings smelled a little rancid.  I did not give to the dogs."
1,"I'm not opposed to change,but I do oppose change when change wasn't needed in the first place. I am so disappointed in Necco's misguided decision to change their classic Sweethearts conversation hearts. Once a great traditional candy they're now just gross. They changed all the flavors, eliminated the white ones all together (which as luck would have it, were my favorites) and changed the nice crunchy texture to a soft disintegrating mess. Bleck. What a huge mistake. Why change a trusty classic? Why not just make a new candy?"
1,"Pasta is just fine......initial order was for for $19.95......now the price is $36.67......back to the local grocery store.....don't need what obviously must be gold-plated pasta."
1,"The labeling debate continues ... Natural... Doesn't mean it's natural to consume!  How can a product geared towards children that boasts 'made with real fruit and vegetable juice' also contain an ingredient that among other things, prohibits the normal absorption of vitamins and is used to clean industrial products? Please search 'mineral oil' before purchasing Motts products. There are healthy gummy alternatives out there or you can offer actual fruit and vegetables at snack time.  I am referring specifically to Mott's Medleys assorted fruit fruit flavored snacks. Let's keep our kids healthy!!!"
1,"I have purchased this product many times during the last two years. They used to arrived in very good conditon. Dates were allways soft and juicy. This is the second time I receive them in bags without label. Fruits are dry and it is not a pleasure to eat them anymore. I am really very dissapointed"
1,"Nothing on the website or on Amazon.com let us know these treats are made in China.  We do not feed our dogs any treats made in China!"
1,"THIS WAS THE WORSE STUFF EVER  IT TASTED HORRIBLE AND I BOUGHT TWO AND THEY WILL GO IN THE TRASH  TASTES NOTHING LIKE HOT CHOCOLATE"
1,"Like the first lady, I tried this today for the first time. It tastes great at first. But after the flavor is gone and the gum is out, there is a terrible tomato-like aftertaste. It's really bad and you can't get rid of it by chewing something else. It's really really bad, I wouldn't recommend this gum at all."
1,"Amazon is listing ""nutritional info"" such as protein, calories, etc., but omitting the actual list of ingredients in these supplements.  I would like to see what I will actually be eating should I use these, and that info is not available here.<br /><br />Note: the ""1 star"" awarded in this review does not reflect on this specific product, of which I have no firsthand knowledge.  It's just that I couldn't post this review without choosing 1 to 5 stars."
1,"Don't know if you get 1 box or 4 boxes by picture shown. Is not clear if you get 6 oz or 30 lbs!"
1,"I gave this product three tries; with a good hair product I think you should be able to tell its worth by then. I have long, very thick hair, and cheap conditioners tend to cause a lot of quick buildup; this was no exception. I could still feel the waxiness by the next time I washed my hair. Give this one a pass - use a real shea butter product instead, and it should absorb into the hair and scalp better."
1,"We recently purchased the K-Cup machine and I was quite excited as I drink iced tea rather than coffee. This blend of black tea is quite bitter and not at all what I was looking for. It works as advertised, just not the right tea for me."
1,"To be honest, although I've always enjoyed anything with Paul Newman's name on it and have always reordered things, this time I would not. I really like coffee. This reminded me of instant."
1,"It tasted like plastic coated in salt. They were way too salty, especially if you wanted a dip. The crackers themselves have this shiny coating on them that when you bite into them, they break like plastic. Not good. Will not repurchase."
1,"Anyone see where theses are made? - I am avoiding treats from China because of all the problems lately. and I do not see a country of origin here."
1,"The ingredients are different from the label. I ruined a chicken with this seasonong which is so salty as to be indigestible. Salt is listed as the first ingredient but in the description Garlic is listed first. Terrible seasoning."
1,"This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups. I have not had this problem with other K cup manufactures. I will not reorder."
1,"I purchased two different waffle mixes and when I received the items they were both 2 months expired. If it were possible I would have given it zero stars."
1,"all this powder does is float in the liquid- It doesn't mix with it at all.  So you drink dust powder AND liquid rather than a new mixed drink.  Secondly - Doesn't taste good at all.  Won't be buying again."
1,"I used to LOVE zico tetra pack. this new stuff in new bottle is super plasticy and ugly. !!"
1,"I have used the Cutter for about four years, and other than having trouble getting it to siphon, the poison worked very satisfactorily. In the past week, I sprayed my grand daughter's yard, and my yard, at HUGE concentrations, and the mosquitoes have laughed at the poison and eaten me alive. There has ALWAYS been a problem with the siphoning, especially if you used only a partial bottle and went back later to use it up, but the poison doesn't work any more, so what's the point."
1,"Don't buy these.  They are made in China.  I found them on a ""made in USA"" page on Amazon but that is incorrect."
1,"I love mashed potatoes. But I goofed on this batch. These are much too highly seasoned for my taste. Betty Crocker tried too hard to be distinctive. If she had let the poor reds be themselves they would have been wonderful."
1,"The ingredients listed are NOT for this particular recipe! The lamb, barley mix does not include chicken as this page indicates. Love the potato, whitefish mix by the way. My 12 yr old is doing well on it."
1,"I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as ""Chili & Lime"".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is ""NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME"". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues."
1,"Dogs wouldn't touch it and it smelled nasty!  What a waste of money!  I recommend trying to get a sample before you buy it."
1,"My son hated it. I tasted some and saw why. It's tart and the barley gives it a weird smell and flavor. Yuck!"
1,"these raisins are drowned in dark chocolate. I cant even taste them. I love dark chocolate but the kind they used tastes like chalk. Becareful, there is no return. So I'm stuck with 5 lbs of chalky dark chocolate :/"
1,"I sent this as a gift. The cookies were broken, and customer service said, ship back at YOUR expense and we'll refund you! Are you kidding? Bad! Stay away!"
1,"I have used Medifast products for four months and lost quite a bit of weight.  These southwestern style eggs are the worst Medifast food that I have ordered next to the regular flavored eggs.  No matter how you prepare them - microwave, stove top, oven - they taste horrible.<br /><br />They are rubbery and smell like spoiled eggs.  Skip these and try some of the better tasting Medifast products like the Cinnamon pretzels, Chocolate Crunch bars, and Chocolate pancakes."
1,"Just got my coffee, I will use it as an emergency supply, when my every day coffee (from local roaster) runs out.<br />I tasted it this morning, very disappointed. I taste like cardboard/old/vented coffee... I expected much better from Lavazza.<br />Maybe the lot I got is a old one... Who know, won't buy it again."
1,"We have four indoor dogs that ever since they were puppies we have fed them science diet. The main reason was because chicken was the first ingredient. Now I have notice since December our dogs have really started shedding. There fur also is not as soft as it used to be. I just thought maybe they were shedding their winter coat. Well I finally remembered to check the ingredients on the bag this week. Boy was I shocked when I read the first ingredient now. It is no longer chicken on my bag. It is ground whole grain corn. Now if I wanted to feed them that I would buy the much cheaper dog food. So check your bags for the ingredients. I will no longer be using Science Diet."
1,"There IS a difference! I was under the impression this was a chocolate flavored coffee with raspberry undertones. It's the opposite. I hate the raspberry flavor because it makes it taste like cough medicine. I tried mixing it a hot chocolate mix but it didn't work. That raspberry flavor is very overpowering. Also, it's only one star because I have a tendency to like medium roasts but this is less than a light roast. Watery raspberry coffee truffles with a suggestion of chocolate is a more accurate description. They smell good, though."
1,"Brooklyn ""French Roast"" K-Cup Coffee is not one of my favorites. It's not awful.  It's okay if you're in a ""pinch"" and it's the only pod you have.  I ended up giving my entire box to a friend.  I wasn't a fan.  There was nothing special or memorable about the taste.  I won't buy it again and I won't recommend it."
1,"The product description said that a bamboo cutting board was included, but there is none. I gave this as a gift and was present when they opened it so I'm sure there is no cutting board. That is the reason I bought this gift basket instead on a different one. Not very happy with it."
1,"The company is trying to rip people off.  Only one mozzle in the package NOT twenty four as stated.  When I contacted the company, they did refused to send me twenty three more moozles or refund my money."
1,"My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great ""treat"", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2-3 since, 2009!<br />Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog-go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these ""treats""!"
1,"These chips (all flavors of the variety pack) are really terrible.  I have thrown away a lot of them and suffered through eating some of them.  They are over spiced and nasty."
1,"These are the worst granola bars I have ever had in my life. I gave one to my two year old today without trying it myself and she wouldn't eat it. She usually loves granola bars. I went to eat the rest of it and couldn't even bite into it! I had to gnaw it to get some off. And when I did it tasted like plain oatmeal held together with wax. It was disgusting. Missed it by a mile on this one Annie."
1,"Our 11 week old Bullmastiff puppy, Jolene, died this week after playing with this toy.  She was able to get the chicken treat ball out of the toy and got it lodged in her throat.  She received prompt emergency vet assistance but died in the emergency room.  Please do not purchase this product for you pets."
1,"I have been using this little machine for just a few months(2-3 months).  I absolutely loved it for a few times in the beginning.  Then, it starts to leak brown liquid that looks like lubricant or oil from the center steel part.  I tried to clean the center vigorously and completely dry it before using it again.  Same leaks happened.  What a waste of $100 for very short usage.  I am calling service center but, I will not be using it again until permanent solution is found.  I am not going to feed oil/lubricant to my 8-months-old baby.  Very UPSET!!!  Going back to old pan and magic bullet method for now."
1,"My husband bought a package of Ann's House of Nuts Swiss Mix the other day.  I took one look at the ingredients list (posted at the end of my review) and thought, ""How ridiculous.  Why all those ingredients, things you would never have in your kitchen, when really it's just dried fruit, nuts, candy-coated chocolate and peanut butter chips?""<br /><br />Tonight, in a fit of the late night munchies, I decided to try some.<br /><br />Yuck.  There's no taste!  The raisins are bland, the nuts have no flavor.  Even the chocolate is boring.  The dried pineapple has a powdery texture.  Barf...<br /><br />Here's a recipe for you, if you're in the mood for trail mix:  raisins and other dried fruits, nuts of whatever variety you like, chocolate chips.  Mix 'em up.  Voila.  A few flavorful, recognizable ingredients rather than this unnecessary mess:<br /><br />Peanuts (Peanuts, Peanut Oil)Raisins, Ernies (Sugar, Cocoa, Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Whey, Artificial Color [Blue 1, Blue 1 Lake, Blue 2 Lake, Yellow 5, Yellow 5 Lake, Yellow 6, Yellow 6 Lake, Red 40, Red 40 Lake, Sorbitol, Titanium Dioxide, Phosphoric Acid, Methyl and Propyl Parabens, Caramel]Nonfat Milk Powder, Corn Syrup, Soy Lecithin, Wax, Dextrin, Vanillin [Artificial Flavor]Peanut Butter Drops (Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Partially Defatted Peanut Flour, Skim Milk, Whey Powder, Peanut Butter [Peanuts, Partially Hydrogenated Rapeseed and Cottonseed Oil]Dextrose, Salt, Soy Lecithin)Pineapple (Pineapple, Sugar, Calcium Chloride [for Product Texture]Citric Acid, Sulfur Dioxide and Sodium Metabisulfite [for Color Retention]"
1,"I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, ""oooh I have to try"".  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies."
1,"This is a poor excuse for coffee - even for instant coffee. I was looking forward to trying it after hearing good things on the web - unfortunately, I was disappointed. I tried this coffee using the specified instructions, and also tried using less water. The best I can say of it is that it is weak garbage. It is almost like drinking hot water - but with a foul taste that will leave you longing for a real cup of coffee. If you want fast coffee, allow me to suggest a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSMPO"">Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> instead."
1,"i did not want to order a 2 pack so i did not have a lot of choices. this flavor tastes horrible. the apricot flavor is way better."
1,"Every person I try to pawn one of these drinks off on has one sip and the rest is thrown away.<br /><br />I bought a 12 pack of each flavor two months ago... still have 10 left in each pack.<br /><br />The coconut water from concentrate in New Zico is bad for me. It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.<br /><br />Natural coconut water is better than concentrate."
1,"I love this tea, but I only received 3 tins, not a pack 6 as advertised. I am not sure who is at fault- Amazon or Zhena's.... Will continue to  get this product becuase I love it.. but someone needs to verify how many tins are in the order!"
1,"I have not tasted the product but am extremely dissatisfied with Amazon. Such shoddy merchandise should be an embarrassment to the company. ALL the cans, not just one or two were dented (and we're not talking about aesthetic nicks here). How can Amazon send out such low quality items? I will not be ordering this product again. Unacceptable."
1,"I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands.  In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that ""double spice"" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust."
1,"I bought this product for a coctail party.  When it arrived most of the crackers were chipped or completely unusable to serve to guests.  I bought 2 boxes so it turned into a $25.00 mid-night snack.  If you have the opportunity to buy them in the grocery do so, they taste great."
1,"Had an issue with the chicken breast treats, so would not use these, since they are produced in China as well."
1,"The first ingredient isn't even a specific type of meat. It's meat broth. You have NO IDEA what it is. The first ingredient should always be a specific kind of meat, like Chicken. The second ingredient is Meat By-Product. That is the part of a meat, yet again not specified like it should be, that is not approved for human consumption. Like the beaks and legs of a chicken. Unhealthy! ALWAYS LOOK AT THE LABELS."
1,"I'm sorry but in contrast to the other rave reviews for this product, I did not like it at all!  I purchased several e.v. olive oils and this one was most disliked by both my husband and myself.  We tasted it alone and with some fresh bread for dipping and we each experienced a funny feeling inside our mouths and a dry scratchiness to our throats that made us cough.  This has no place in my kitchen.  Sorry Siciliani :)"
1,"This is one of the most horrible things I've ever attempted to eat.  It practically sucks the moisture out of your mouth, and the texture is like chewing sand without the crunch.  It has this awful tangy but bland flavor, and is barely swallowable.  I'm glad things like this are available to people who have many allergies and intolerances, but I feel so sorry for them having to eat it.  We only tried this bread during the elimination phase of an oligoantigenic diet, and even if I could never have bread again, I'd rather eat peanut butter and jelly plain, than put it on this disgusting stuff.  Horrid.  Absolutely horrid."
1,"I bought Blue Diamond Natural Chocolate almonds before & 100% Natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat 10 for the day & i dont know if it's the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away. i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off. but i guess im the 1 in 1 million that this happens to."
1,"First, the pros:  The label is very nice looking and the packaging is swell.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is where the praise ends.  If you have ever tried to reuse a k-cup you'll understand what this coffee tastes like.  I did an experiment weighing five different brands of coffee and found all to be 1/2 oz. or more except Brooklyn and it weighed one tenth of an ounce.  That's 1/5 the weight of Dunkin' Donuts, Newman's Own, Millstone and 1/6 the weight of Starbucks.  This is the second time I've ordered coffee from Amazon and found it to be lacking.  Since they won't take returns, (even from prime members) I don't think I'll order any more coffee from Amazon in the future.  The reason I titled this review the second worst coffee was because I got tricked into buying a coffee that was really just instant coffee in a k-cup cartridge.  On second thought that actually was better than this."
1,"Buy something else. Hydrogenated fats are an unnatural product whereby hydrogen is attached to the fat molecule making it thicker."
1,"This bone was dry and crusted and SO small! It was purchased for a 50lb dog and is more suited in size for a 5 lb dog! WILL NOT buy again!"
1,"I was eating Earth Balance Natural Peanut Butter for a while, but couldn't resist jumping on a Skippy sale. The taste is by far completely different compared to the Earth Balance. Reading the ingredients on the Skippy jar, I realized there was added sugar and hydrogenated oils. I admit, I have a sweet tooth, but the amount of sugar added here must be used to cover up the filler. You're getting less actual peanut butter and more oil and sugar than other brands. I really liked the taste of the Earth Balance much better as Skippy tasted like candy (which is prob why kids prefer it). Pass on this junk food and ween yourself off the sugar intake. I'll use this to fill the Kong toy for my dogs."
1,"I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one.  Unedible.  Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same."
1,"I called the number on the package and was told the case of Oh Henry bars I bought from Amazon was<br />out of date and that I should return them for a refund. When I find what looks like a deal it's NOT, amazon is trying<br />top dispose of old stock passing it on to the customer. Is this any way to treat good customers? I spend hundreds of dollars at Amazon and most of the time am happy but this is uncalled for. I also ordered some batteries and they too were at the end of the 6 year freshness date."
1,"Not sure if the product is good yet, but it promised to arrive ""next day"" and here I wait,  4 days later.  Since it is a food product, I'm not excited to receive 5 day old noodles...of course that assumes they arrive tomorrow."
1,"I have always purchased Kirkland Extra Fancy Mixed Nuts because of their high quality and taste.  Even as the price continued to climb.  But the quality and freshness is now on a downhill slide.  The mixture has changed to mostly cheaper nuts.  They advertise macadamia nuts but only a few small pieces in the container.  I will be looking elsewhere--no longer wanting to pay premium price for mediocre products."
1,"Wellll...not so good is what I would rate this product. I bought 4 containers for a client gift. The expiration date was past the expiration....which was evident because the candy came stuck together within each package. I tried to salvage what I could because I didnt leave myself enough time for error."
1,"I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.<br /><br />I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?"
1,"I purchase almost daily from Amazon and recommend Amazon to my friends constantly. I think that makes me a very good customer.<br />I have a very serious concern. When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as ""MADE IN CHINA"". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!<br />I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Amazon for selling without disclosing the source!"
1,"First, I expected this to be like dry jerky.  This was wet and soggy with a spongy texture.  There is something so off putting about the flavor, it's like wet dog food.  The first bite seemed okay, but I could not finish it even though it was small.  Regretfully, I decided to buy this anyway based on the reviews... I read all the one star reviews and thought ""Heyyyy now, it can't be that bad! These people must be clueless. they must be expecting it to taste like real jerky, of course it's not!""  I was soooo wrong."
1,"To be honest, I did not get the Utz pretzels, Special Sourdough I ordered.  I got some type of pretzel that was totally not what I ordered.  I was really, really disappointed because I was going to have these pretzels at work.  I figured it was going to be too expensive to send them back so I kept them.  I am not going to order anything like this again in the future because I was so disppointed."
1,"the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag."
1,"Its been a while since I tried this but I decided to write up a review anyway.  My little one LOVES his pouches, but this is one he would not have.  After tasting it, I had to agree with him.  Maybe he does not like green peppers either.  If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.  I'd suggest you try ONE pouch to see if you like it before you purchase several."
1,"i have already given my review ion this product,<br />the product was horrible quality, the cheri liquor filling was completely dry! I wonder how old it was.<br />I will never order again form this place, a store that sells fresh and good quality food would have never sent those boxes"
1,"I bought this because I would buy Kirkland (Costco's brand) instant mac 'n' cheese and almost always only use the cheese powder as a quick way to make mac n cheese with my favorite pasta. When it came in the mail (quick shipping), I noticed that it has no packaging date, sell by date, or expiration date. I found that a little odd and was iffy to use it but tried it out anyway. From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder."
1,"I was pretty excited when I bought the B70 for my wife, she likes coffee and I'm a hot chocolate drinker.  I ended up buying the Cafe Escapes, got it home, put it in the brewer and the last half second that comes out of it is clear water, thought right away uh-oh real bad sign.  I added some milk to the finished product, topped it with some whipped cream, took a nice sip and thought wow this cup of hot water tastes just like a cup of hot water with some chocolate in it.  The next step was to Escape (BAM!! RIM-SHOT!!) from this horrible cup of hot chocolate, walk over to the sink and poor it down the drain.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />I guess I'll stick to boiling my milk on the stove for 10 minutes, pouring in 4 nice scoops of Nestle Quik and enjoying a real hot chocolate."
1,"all of my order came just as stated,but the chocolate was past the due date and some of it had white spots and tasted bad.thought i was getting quality for my money but got squat for my expense.will not buy any foodstuffs from amazon ever again.espeacialy not chocolate,no quality control just old stuff that was bought cheap and stockpiled.and foisted off on unsuspecting customers.good day."
1,"I cannot locate the expiration date on any bottles or did I miss it? Can this honey be last forever? It should have an expiration date. Every food items has it."
1,"This is good cocoa, but you'd almost have better luck just opening the K-cup and stirring it in. I have found that if I make it as per the box directions, I'll have about 1/4 of the cocoa still inside the cup.<br /><br />Also, you do not want to do this on the large cup size - it will be so diluted that will not want to drink it. I make it using the middle sized cup and use 2 k-cups.<br /><br />I got this on sale for $7, so it wasn't too bad of a price, but I think in the future I will just stick to buying a container of hot cocoa."
1,"I bought this white truffle oil and not sure if it's the batch or just the way it is; it's not that good at all!  To me it tasted more like oil with a very slight hint of truffles.  The after taste is difficult to describe; bottom line it's not that pleasant.  I emailed the seller regarding the quality of the product but no respond.  I do not see the UPC code label on the product or any date code.  Looks more homemade.  Just in case you're wondering, you get one small slice of truffle peel in the bottle."
1,"I like several of Dr. McDougall's items, but not this one. Don't waste your money. Try one of his other soups instead, like the split pea or minestrone."
1,"This coffee arrived fast but when I went to shake the cup it was a big hard ball... they were all like that, I guess they are old and almost expired...This item is non returnable so I am just out the money. Don't buy from this seller."
1,"I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated."
1,"How could all the cans arrive with large dents.  I think they are getting rid of their dented cans this way:("
1,"These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant."
1,"It came And it was already open. It was spilled all over the package it was mailed. It was quite a mesa"
1,"after multiple tries its always the same, the popcorn pops about 50%. it is definitely bad popcorn because i succesfully used the oil pack with my own popcorn and achieved great results. i found it interesting that there is no date code on either the case or the packages. isn't there a law about that or something?"
1,"This product states on the label ""Fructose FRUIT Sugar,"" but the fructose in this product is in fact not made from fruit; it is made from corn.  Corn is not a fruit product.  I think it is deceptive of NOW to label their fructose sugar as ""Fructose Fruit Sugar"" when it's not."
1,"After reading about these noodles on Hungry Girl and following all the buzz, I had to try them for myself.  Afterall, I've discovered a lot of new reduced calorie options over the years that merit the trade-off.  Unfortunately, these noodles were just not worth it.  The texture alone kept me from wanting more than two bites.  Still hopeful, I mixed them together with spaghetti sauce and grated parmesean cheese and let them sit overnight in the frig (as sometimes the flavors can make it better the second day).  Again, no luck.  Just plain yucky.  Maybe putting in soup would help change the rubbery texture??? Not sure but I won't be trying again anytime soon."
1,"I've been something of a Red Bull addict for a decade now, drinking it not for its energy effects (as my body has built up quite a caffeine tolerance) as its interesting flavour, nice and quite different to any other beverage I've tried. Seeing this fairly new Red Bull Energy Shot product as an impulse buying item in my supermarket checkout, I thought I'd give it a try. It's awful.<br /><br />What you are getting here is not the same as Red Bull in an aluminium can, except with more caffeine per volume. Rather, it's uncarbonated and significantly thicker. The only comparison I could draw is cough syrup. And if you're much of an energy drink fan, you're probably too used to caffeine to get the rush of energy that the product promises.<br /><br />Consequently, even if you love Red Bull in the can, I'd really suggest trying a single one of these shots from the shop before ordering a bulk shipment here."
1,"I have tested 6 bottles of Essentia with Swanson pH test tape and 6.2 pH is the highest tested...not even close to 9.5 pH as advertised .  Very disappointing results so far."
1,"some company must have bought out the Clark name because i used to absolutely LOVE these candy bars and remember them very well.  i was so anxious to get them and when i did and bit into one, I could not believe it! they were absolutely horrible! i mean, even for a candy bar, they were bad!  i felt robbed. and could not return them to get my money back.  i felt cheated and, as i said, robbed. but even more than that, i really wanted those wonderful candy bars.  one star really doesn't say it, it really deserved NO stars!"
1,"Buyer beware of this product.  It coagulates and congeals to a thick white paste when chilled.  It takes on the appearance of solid animal fat.  I  called Sovena USA Inc for an answer.  The Sovena Inc. Customer Service Rep. took a week to get back to me and then explained that this is a ""blend"" and should not be chilled.  He could not tell me what is  in this blend and said that it will take time for him to research and get an answer for me.  I am still waiting for his response (almost 2 weeks later).  I subsequently purchased Botticelli Olive Oil to see if it reacted the same way when chilled and  thankfully it did not.  I made the exact same tomato salad using the 2 brands of oil and the Oliveri blend encased the tomatoes in a greasy thick disgusting mess.  The tomato salad made with the Botticelli Oil looked as appetizing when I took it out of the fridge as it did when I put it in.<br /><br />Tomato Salad Recipe:<br />2 ripe vine tomatoes - cut in large cubes<br />1/2 cup olive oil - (I recommend Botticelli Extra Virgin Olive Oil)<br />3 cloves crushed garlic<br />1 tsp. salt<br />1/2 tsp. oregano<br />Mix ingredients together, chill for at least 1 hour  and serve"
1,"Worst product ever from Amazon..and i buy a lot of things but this tastes like dead fish that died twice.Do not buy.<br />Buy the dead fish instead."
1,"If you want 100% olive oil in your mayonnaise, you'll have to make it yourself OR order it from Spain or Italy.  You can buy imported mayonnaise with 100% olive oil, but if you buy it from Kraft or obviously this brand, you are going to get the almighty SOYBEAN."
1,"I really feel it is not the flavor that is causing the problem; it tastes rotten so I'm wondering if the packager let some part of the juice sit out too long.  I haven't had a problem with VitaCoco products prior to this so I really think that is what happened.  I am also concerned because these comments have not been addressed by the company.  In my opinion, these should be recalled."
1,"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!"
1,"I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but the positive reviews on this product made me hopeful. While mixing the ingredients, a foul smell filled the kitchen. When I poured the batter into the waffle iron, the smell improved slightly. Again... hopeful. Yet while the texture resembled a waffle, the taste was so bad I spit it out immediately. No syrup/whipped creme/fruit can cover up the taste. Skip the batter and try the Atkins Caramel Chocolate Nut Roll instead. Tastes just like a Baby Ruth :)"
1,"I love cheese-flavored snacks and I was highly disappointed by these. Their styrofoam texture was offset only by putrid tang of faux cheese powder. I'm pretty sure the only good Smart Fries flavor is salt and vinegar."
1,"I needed a very good product for my dogs in the Vetri-Science Glyco-Flex Stage II joint support.  This product came highly recommended from my Vet.  I reviewed the Amazon site for what I thought was a good price when the Ad showed 2 bottles of the product.  I thought I was getting two bottles for the price.  I only received One bottle.  I wrote the company customer Services who agreed that the two bottles was misleading and they would get back to me the next day after she talked to her supervisor.  That was on December 13 and today is December 23 and still no response, even after 3 other emails from me.  This company is very, very poor in customer service as well and misleading in their ads.  I believe that Amazon is partially at blame for this problem and that this company should no longer be able to sell their products from Amazon Market.  Avoid PetFoodDirect.com because you will get taken."
1,"It was worse than gas station cappuccino. It tasted like a powder that became more and more watered down the larger the cup you chose to make. Not worth it."
1,"This tastes pretty much like your plain old Liptons tea. I LOVE cassis (black currant) flavor and was so looking forward to the tea. I buy a blackcurrant tea in Europe that actually tastes like cassis, so I know it is possible.<br /><br />It is drinkable, but nothing special. Look elsewhere if you want blackcurrant flavor.<br /><br />Do a search on Ahmad Blackcurrant tea on Amazon for more reviews.  It is sold in other configurations (different amounts per box).  Most of the other teas are good, this one is not worth the extra price."
1,"After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try, but was very disappointed. The reviews said it was sweet, or over sweet. yet mine was very tart. Don't know if they forget to put sugar in my cherries.  :("
1,"there is no way that there is a decent amount  of ghost pepper in this sauce.  i have habernero sauce that is way hotter than this.<br /><br />according to the scovile scale that should be impossible.  this was a waste of money"
1,"Bought 2 cases of this for my 20 yr old house cat better than 9 moonths ago. Still have an unopened case and 11 cans. The cat can't read any of the mumbo jumbo about ALL NATURAL and all the claims.  All the cat knows is if it's not Fancy Feast or Friskies she aint gonna eat it. I guese the cat can figure out what she prefers. Save your money."
1,"These cookies had a horrible taste, nothing like the sesame cookies we get in New Jersey. Too many flavors competing with the anise. Yuck."
1,"this smells so strong like cat urine i can't even bring myself to drink it . . . nobody else in my office can smell the urine smell but i sure can and i'm really grossed out."
1,"We are disappointed with the Great Northern popcorn for our new machine.<br />It seems stale.....and 'chewy'.<br />We have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn.<br />However, the popcorn we have just received seems old.  We're very disappointed....and wind up not making popcorn very often."
1,"i like real mexican food and i found the taste was suited more towards american taste, and it was not as thick as i want a cheese sauce to be, i bought this like a year ago. will not re-order"
1,"I had my hopes for this bar. The box reads ""Fruit & Nut - Almond, Raisin, Peanut, and Cranberry"", but after taking my first bite, I was surprised by the actual ingredients. The first two ingredients in the nutritional information are Oats and High Maltose Corn Syrup. This is not a fruit and nut bar. It is a grain bar with some fruit and nuts sprinkled in. There are far better products, including ones with almonds and fruits as the main ingredients, and with honey sticking the ingredients together instead of a boat load of corn syrup. I am completely dissatisfied and amazon doesn't offer returns on this product so save yourself some money and buy a better bar."
1,"There is something in the jelly which makes it harden to the point it can't be spread on toast, just won't come off the knife."
1,"They sent a Country Meal Variety pack and not a Gourmet Variety Pack.  My son has so far refused every one of these flavors.  I called and the CS rep refunded me my total as she couldn't guarantee that if she reordered, they'd send the right pack."
1,"DO NOT BUY!!!!! The k-cups came packaged in a stapled brown paper bag. There were only 23 K-cups in the bag, and i had a ""sampler"" of 3 different teas. This is not worth the money or aggravation."
1,"About 1 out of every 3 disks is bad & to my knowledge there is no reasonable recourse? Tassimo will not pay to have the product shipped back if the ""original"" post office package has been opened? How do you know a product is inferior if you don't open it? Tassimo refused to credit my credit card for unordered merchandise while their website was under revision, refused to pay for unordered return package because the outside envelope had been opened so I could see what was inside, etc. I'm stuck with the coffee maker until it no longer works. Their customer service was argumentative and their responses to my problems were not uniform resulting in serious delays & confusion."
1,"After waiting for a month, while I saw clothes moths fly out of my closet, this pathetic product never attracted even one moth.  I'm  disappointed and really upset I wasted my money and time."
1,"28.99 dollars for one pack? Are people stupid, you can buy these at the neares supermarket for less than 28.99, aybe 7 or 8 dollars, but not 28 for one pack..  I know is easy to buy online, but buying this, is just playing lazy!"
1,"I've heard people describe horrible food as tasting like cardboard before.  I never quite knew what they meant until now.  This really does taste like cardboard.  I don't think I could give these a way.  They are trash.  Don't waste your money. Here is a better low carb sweet snack <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZT15EQ"">Blue Diamond Almonds Cinnamon Brown Sugar, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>"
1,"Yuck. And to call them sea salt is a lie. They should call them no salt. They don't resemble a pretzel in taste in any way. All I could taste was a strong sesame seed taste. It's true what others say, there are some super hard seeds in there. Kept getting stuck in my teeth. I can't really think of anything good about them. They are healthy but so are many many things. Don't bother with these."
1,"I get a 64 oz. bottle of this in the store for $8.  If it was three 64-oz bottles it still wouldn't be worth it.  Wondered if they made a mistake in listing this."
1,"I would never purchase this product again. The only reason why it is purchased by many to begin with is because the nutrition facts are not posted online, and the product is ridiculously cheap. However, this product is loaded with trans fat: in all but a few, the total trans fat content in one pack is over the American Heart Association's recommended limit (2g daily). This product is also loaded with saturated fat (also bad)."
1,"I tried these for the first time and the cocolate taste is weak and the sweetness is very strong.  I almonst taste like flavored sugar water with a hint of cocoa."
1,"I was disappointed to receive Earth's Best Organic Snakin' Fruit Rings Banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat."
1,"I bought this on my sisters recomendation. I did not like this flavor so ended up giving away the entire case."
1,"I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. This one's consistency is like baby food.  I ofter buy similar products, including a hearty Palak Paneer from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better in flavor and cost far less."
1,"After reading the good reviews, I decided to give this gelatin a try.  Unfortunately, I didn't read Amazon's return policy first.  I gagged trying to drink this in water, so I tried mixing it in yogurt.  Still couldn't stand the taste.  Then I felt terrible all day. After smelling it, I had concerns, but thought I might be able to mix it with something to overcome the odor.  It didn't work, and it definitely isn't worth feeling bad.  I can't imagine how so many people can tolerate this stuff."
1,"This waffle mix is so tasteless.  I'm shocked to hear this is the brand that is sold in some hotels. I would not recommend it to anybody."
1,"Buckwheat with milk is my favorite meal start from early childhood. I born in Ukraine and Buckwheat is very different over there - it's pretty brown seeds. Not light green like this one. Even without roasting it was delicious tasty and smells so fine. But, because I am now too far from the Ukraine and Russian stores too expensive for me I guess I have to add anything else to my Buckwheat kasha in order to have some taste in this meal...<br />By the way, any Buckwheat can become mushy if you don't know few simple secrets. I would love to share: First - water should always cover the seeds 2 fingers above (horizontal position =)<br />Second: add little of salt to Buckwheat in the water and bring the water to a boil FAST, then<br />reduce the heat to minimum and allow to simmer for not a few minutes but until ALL water will<br />be inside of the seeds.<br />If you put too little of water - you will eat dry, raw and possibly burned kasha.<br />If you put too much of water - you will eat wet and mushy kasha.<br />And , if you cook in the BOILED water you will get all combinations above.<br />Good luck and enjoy. It is food from the Heaven.<br />Victoria"
1,"This product did NOT reach anywhere close to my expectations.  The seller was promt and easy to deal with, but truthfully, the product itself was basically useless.  Just my opinion, but I wouldn't waste my time or money on this again."
1,"I got this gardenia bonsai in mid-February and it is not as I expected. Upon opening the package, the leaves are dull green, no buds, dried out and mostly dark brown. I followed the instruction and even did some research work through the internet. I even bought extra stuffs like plant food, cool mist humidifier just to revive the plant. Well now, after 3 weeks, 90% of the leaves are gone, branches bare, looks like those bare trees that you see during winter. I tried to contact the merchant and ask for advise, but I did not get any response. I have other bonsais and regular gardenias that are healthy and I really wanted this gardenia bonsai so bad."
1,"My dog does not touch this stuff. The paste is messy and not something you would let your puppy play with in the house. I did try freezing the Kong toy but as soon as the paste thaws it oozes out of the toy and creates a huge mess. He does like the Kong Toy without the paste."
1,"We were very excited to order the Blueberry Pancake mixes since we've loved many other Stonewall products. Unfortunately, we didn't like the pancake mix at all. We actually ended up throwing the pancakes away. The batter itself tasted terrible. It had this strong, almost sour taste and almost seemed carbonated/fizzy? We thought it would be better after we cooked it, but it wasn't. Also the blueberries were like hard little rocks.<br /><br />Too bad we bought the 3-pack, because now we have a lot of this product and won't be able to use it."
1,"We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat."
1,"I am sure it would work well if we used peanut butter that it would fit on. I didn't see different sizes offered on the Amazon web site and just ordered...my mistake. I have no idea if it is a good product or not. Susie"
1,"My husband just read on the box that Raisin Bran is now made in Mexico. I was shocked.  I don't feel confident that the quality is the same as if it was made in the USA.  We cancelled our subscription."
1,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: &lt;...>. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???"
1,"I didnt buy on amazon but thought of giving a review so that someone can be saved from wasting money. DON'T buy this product, it just s***s. There is not other work I can find. Please don't buy and waste money and it's not even water it's soda and taste's like crap."
1,"We've bought Jennies macaroons for years now, so when we saw they had almond flavored macaroons, we didn't bat an eye. Bought 'em right away. When my daughter and I tasted them, we had to spit it all out. Maybe they were expired? There was no way to tell, but they were sickening. Due to them not being returnable, we had to throw out all 6 cans. The whole experience was hard to swallow."
1,"After eating TANG's chocolate and double-chocolate cookies, all other cookies will taste like expired, tepid dogfood to you. Her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible. Tim Horton's, Timothy's, Second Cup, Starbucks, Treats and those horrid packaged cookies at Zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a TANG cookie. HER COOKIES ARE DA BOMB!!! A+++++++ Hawt damn!"
1,"I've tried C2O, Vitacoco, and Naked coconut water. All of them contain one ingredient:100% natural coconut water. However, ZICO is the ONLY coconut water that is 1) Made from concentrate and 2) contains added ""Natural ingredients"". At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have ""natural flavors"" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises ""30 percent less sugar""...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add ""natural flavors"". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20."
1,"Poor value for the price.  $27.99 for six ounces?  That makes it almost $75 a pound for an ordinary and unexceptional product.  I've learned my lesson, never again!"
1,"I tried these squares this morning, but even with the addition of more brown sugar than what was in the product, they were tasteless!  I agree that they are crunchy, but I expected much more from the product, more on the order of Kellogg's Little Bites which even kids seem to eat with relish.  I don't know what I'm going to do with the remainder of the box as I can't recommend this product, but I hate to throw food away, even when I don't like it."
1,"I ordered these thinking for the price, they must be outta this world good! Wrong!<br />They didn't even have a cherry in them!  Frankly, the cheap sugar free cordials from Whitman are way, way better. Sorry I wasted my money."
1,"I bought some of their cupcakes, and the same thing happened. I didn't even swallow the bite I took. It tasted dry and salty. I couldn't believe how completely awful they were. I bought a box of devil dogs the next day for $2.39, and they were ok. They weren't as moist as I remembered them to be, but they were nice with my coffee. I'm afraid to try any of the other brands. Little Debbie is one. I can't remember the names. But the prices are so OUTRAGEOUS here. Who in their right mind is going to pay $2.00 for one Devil Dog. I Ain't that desperate."
1,"We love fruit leather, but this is almost impossible to eat it is so tough.  My kids can't even eat it.  I will not buy this brand again."
1,"They are tasteless, but I could not stand the FEEL.  I threw them all away.  I would not even give them away.  This falls under.....""If it sounds too good to be true..it probably is""."
1,"The box of teas itself was opened and put back together.... not something you want to see when opening a christmas present. I would NOT recommend buying from this buyer."
1,"These gummies are something that we do not want the radical islam terroist to get there hands on. From what I know now, there are no secrets that would be worth keeping, if they threatned to make me eat the gummies. First my head was on fire and my ears were pulsating. I looked down to see if someone by accident had stuck a brading iron through my stomach. It took so much energy away from me that I crawled to the toilet. This kind of diarrhea made me think of a new invention.... seat belts for the toilet. I had such diarrhea that I was producing thrust. Just as I was about to pass out, the noise from my ringing ears distracted me enough to not pass out and realize that ther was more thrust coming. Just as I thought this was over the finally came with dead lips. Yep my lips went numb like I had a shot of novacane. This was the conclusion and after my wife said she could now see my pupils again and my eyes came back down in alignment. At this point we told the 911 operator that we were going to hold off on the ambulance.<br /><br />T. Williams, an ex gummie bear purchaser."
1,"I was really disappointed to find out that LIDS of Earth's Best foods contain BPA. I tried to contact company and ask them why they use BPA, by the way BPA is not used in Canada and Europe for baby food, but they did not contact me. BPA has estrogenic effect, what can be the cause of obesity, there is evidence that BPA has effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior.<br />Food itself is OK, but I can not understand how they can risk ours baby life and health by using BPA!??<br />Definitely, we should do something with that."
1,"I agree with several of the reviews I read.  I have been using my Babycook for only 2 months and was really enjoying making my son's baby food, until I noticed that the water coming from the reservoir was discolored.  I looked inside the reservoir and noticed the black film that several other reviews mention.  Now I am very concerned about the food safety and will not be steaming my son's food with this machine.  I have even been diligent about cleaning it with white vinegar as mentioned in the instruction manual, which obviously did not prevent this probleme.  It also produces a small amount of food, so I am constantly having to make food for my son.  I have not tried to contact the company yet, but will be doing so this week.  I do not recommend this product."
1,"This product is old. The experation date is early 2012.  When you open it, it's the color of beef<br />boullion.<br /><br />Will not desolve in hot water.<br /><br />Returned to shpr"
1,"So, my ""Cat Grass Plus Catnip Seeds"" arrived today, looks exactly like the one pictured.<br /><br />Here's my problem:<br />Seller- ""Product contains Aged Pine Bark Peat Moss Perlite Vermiculite Hardwood Charcoal Plantagel and Nepeta Cataria (Catnip Seeds).""<br />Package- ""Ingredients: Wheat or oat seed, vermiculite and Plantagel (potassium propenoate and propenamide copolymers). Plantagel is a non-toxic water absorption agent.""<br /><br />Seems like I'm missing something here...<br /><br />Well, I'm going to keep it because my cats have had this kind of thing from the pet store before but, I really wanted catnip."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:33 Mins<br /><br /></span>I ordered two cases of this.  The one I got in a gift<br />basket, was just great.  It was cream style corn, nice and creamy.<br /><br />But, the ones I ordered directly from Glory, turned out to be just plain old whole corn!!  I would bother ordering this.  Watch the video, you be the judge.<br /><br />I sent them an email, wait to see what happens?"
1,"I am used to the old fashioned kinds with just peanuts and salt as ingredients. I thought I would try Skippy Natural Creamy peanut butter spread simply because a recipe called for it. I tried some before using it and this stuff tastes like oil and wax. If you like fake flavors than you might like this. Otherwise, stick with the real stuff that you have to stir, it's so worth it!"
1,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo."
1,"Very surprised.  Expected it to be thicker.  My 8 month olds are not pickey eaters but they refused to close thier mouths while this food was is there.  I would try it from babies r us before buying in bulk here."
1,"A giant bottle of murky liquid that tastes (kinda) like vanilla and lemon and possibly other unspecified flavors. What could possibly go wrong? You may want to consider using vanilla and lemons instead."
1,"I have purchased Grove Square coffee before and was very happy with it so.... I figured the caramel apple cider would also tingle my taste buds.  Wrong!  The smell is even a bit funky.  Not that it's totally undrinkable but I'd prefer to drink dirty dish water."
1,"I love most Bob's Red Mill products, but not this one.  The pie crust tasted like beans.... yuck!  I would search rice flour with potato starch & tapioca starch as a better alternative."
1,"I bought 2 packs - 4 traps. In two weeks - they caught a grand total of 2 moths. I probably caught 4 times more than that, and I wasn't even trying. Useless."
1,"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package does not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog."
1,"This smells delicious when you brew it, but it is HORRIBLY sweet - like, WAY too much sweetener.  It leaves that nasty artificial sweetener taste in your mouth, too.  I'll stick with the Green Mountain Apple Cider K Cups (they are sweetened with sugar and stevia and they are delicious)."
1,"I spent many hours on the internet studying and reviewing dog foods before I decided to start using this ""premium"" brand. They had this video of their state of the art facility where everything was hospital clean and everyone wore gloves and masks. Now I just found out via a salmonella recall notice that Wellness doesn't even make their own dog food! They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag. I have just switched to a new company called ""Life's Abundance"". This food is produced and sold directly from the manufacturer to you with no middleman."
1,"May possibly contain genetically modified organisms. Do you want to be part of a science experiment? Google ""can GMOs be harmful to your health?"""
1,"This cereal is made in the same facility as wheat containing raisin bran. The amount of gluten in it appears to be low, but it was enough to cause a family member to miss 40 hours of work over a several week period!<br />What really makes me angry about this cereal is that the info on the box makes it seem that Erewhon is a small family owned company dedicated to healthy products.  It may have been at one time, but Erewhon is now owned by U S Mills and they are NOT dedicated to your health. It took weeks to figure out what was making our family sick, because I trusted the brand...BIG MISTAKE. If you want to be strictly gluten free, DON'T EAT THIS CEREAL!"
1,"I bought this because Dr. Oz said that it could help people eat more fruits and veggies, which I hate. Unless you douse it with vinegar or lemon juice, it does not make them more tolerable. If you do not like red peppers to begin with sucking on these little pills will not help. Sure it may taste like a cross between a pepper and a sweet tart, but who wants to eat that. Save you money, buy a bag of sweet tarts and chew them along with your red pepper, you will have the same thing at a far cheaper price.<br /><br />This product is good for teenagers who want to do those tasting parties with their friends."
1,"I recently admitted to myself that I'm lactose intolerant, but I don't want to completely give up on mac and cheese in a box. I found this at Whole Foods and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />The pasta itself is good. I like the tiny shells. And I got the sauce to its proper consistency. It looks very appetizing when done right. However, it tastes disgustingly bland. There's no cheese flavor whatsoever. It's like liquified garlicky cardboard mixed in with pasta. I feel like throwing it up, even though there's technically nothing in it my body can't tolerate. Ugh."
1,"As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural.  ""Natural"" does not equal tasty,and it often means nothing important. Besides tasting better,I wish the sodium levels were more readable - and lower.Sure fat,sugar and protein are all important,but more people die of cardiac disease and hypertension -linked to high sodium in the diet- than from lack of protein."
1,"I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as ""Chili & Lime"".<br /><br />First of all, where's the chili? I don't even taste it. Even tho I'm an advanced chili pepper user, I have a very keen palate. I detect less than 1 part per billion of chili in these here unfortunate chips.<br /><br />Also, I detect fraudulent lime flavors and *that* my friends is an egregious error from such a reknowned company. The red herring that it's NOT natural is ""NATURAL FLAVORS WITH LIME"". The translation here is that these natural flavors could be really anything, could be any combination of terpene extracts from 'natural sources'. For example, fake lemon flavor in candies and wood detergent is often an extract from lemongrass because it's cheaper than from lemons. But it's a different chemical also. Fake lime is immediately a mistake, and anyone-not just supertasters-can tell.<br /><br />This fakeLime taste, or 'floor detergent flavor', is reminiscent of a childhood fragrance- the strong chemical citrus waft of mopwater that a theater employee was using to mask the rotting popcorn-soda-slurry smell by the dumpster.<br /><br />In other words, it seems as if Garden of Eatin found the cheapest, strongest floor stripping chemicals from Big Lots, extracted the lime scent component and littered it lightly onto these chips.<br /><br />So if you want to mop floor with a tea of these, or you are considering a colon cleanse, accept no substitute.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Ok so along the lines of constructive criticism:<br /><br />ATTN: Garden of EATIN'<br /><br />Please contact Tostitos sensory labs scientists. It is imperative that you find out how Tostitos makes their hint of lime chips because they got it right. Use at least 500 ppm nanolimeparticles and same same for chili. Coat those suckers with maybe 1/2 to 100% of the rate used for redhotblues."
1,"Despite my following all the directions, not 1 single blade of wheat grass broke the soil.  How do I get my money back, since I have used the product?  Will be more careful next time."
1,"This is nothing like the real thing ! I am unable to understand why the amount of positive reviews .<br />I bought this since I was unable to find Mustaphas in Wegmans supermarket here in NY.<br />To buy Mustaphas online is expensive !! product price not so bad, but when  the shipping is added it is quite pricey ( but well worth every cent)<br />please trust me on this it is worth it ! I buy mine in the pack of three saves a bit and I use them quickly , However if you really enjoy Mina and are 5 star happy with it great !! I am happy for you.<br />But I can say this with complete honesty once you have tried Mustaphas I doubt you will ever want to buy any other . So How do I describe how wonderful a product Mustaphas Moccican Harissa is ?and how the two compare ( they are so different )<br />Mina is thin weak almost tasting like it came from a can .<br />Mustaphas is thick almost as thick as tomato paste with a beautiful deep rich flavor and color which is beautiful, the heat is wonderful, ( you must be able to enjoy the heat) but it is not just raw heat, it is flavor a depth of flavor that almost allows you to picture Mustaphas being made in small homemade batches by artisans who know the taste they are crafting  the flavor will transport you ( no magic carpet required ) and you will find so many uses for it .again the flavor is rich sumptuous the level of heat can be adjusted by the amount you use it takes very little to enjoy the rich flavor and it melds with everything but it is hot .<br />I could not find anything that I could use Mina on, I tried, it was 9.00 for the jar and I felt I must try top like it but in the end I yet threw away a nearly full jar of Mina in a household where even the youngest grandchildren love hot sauces and Harissa ( in small amounts )<br />no one at all liked the Mina product !! My fridge has many bottles of hot sauces, We go through so many, a big favorite is Marie Sharps one of the most flavorful hot sauces We have ever had discovered it years ago when in Belize. I say this so that I might offer you a reference point of my personal taste .I do not mean to compare them as similar products, both are quite different except for astounding flavor, uniqueness, and quality .I hope that this review helps ( and that you will forgive the gramatical errors ).Please check out Mustaphas available on the Amazon site the jar does not show the name in a pronounced way the print that shows the name of the brand is small the words Morrican Harissa might help identify or just do a search . but look for it, try it, do not judge Harissa by Mina !! there can be no comparison between the two .If you are happy with Mina so be it .but if it is the only one you have tried then try Mustaphas take a chance, just be ready to buy a lot of it since you will find so many uses for it, and you will miss it when you run out to be sure .Thanks for listening to sum it up ,I do not like the Mina product at all !! I will not belittle it anymore than I have .I would rather offer you positives and Mustaphas is that positive to be sure .Thanks again"
1,"Twinkies were once great but once they sold out to the big corporation, the quality went down the drain. It's too artificial tasting to be considered food. There are a ton of chemicals and additives added. You call this cake?"
1,"Normally I would have rated this product high as a high-protein bar with a good flavor.  However, the manufacturer has loaded the bar with artificial flavor and artificial colors (yellow 5&6, red 3, blue 1).  Therefore I do not recommend it as a diet or health product."
1,"I like the flavor of coconut water. I love the flavor of mango.<br />This tastes nothing like the combination of the two.<br />Can somebody please explain what 100% natural from concentrate means?"
1,"Either these folks are completely ignorant or they think putting "" no genetically engineered ingredients"" on the front of the package will cause us to to ignore their list of ingredients on the back.  Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil, but I'd<br />rather not take part in that lottery. I'd like to send back this lot, but I'm not willing to bet, they would not have the nerve to sell it to the next unsuspecting soul, so it will go straight into the trash can ,where it belongs."
1,"Not nearly as good tasting as the other kcup ciders I've had. My girlfriend hated it too. They are going to find the garbage can."
1,"I bought this coffee because of Mr. Newman's charity. Boy, was that a misguided decision. The coffee is bitter, but the worst attribute is its muddy, sludgy mouth feel--which is the hallmark of poor quality beans. I just threw away about $35 worth...words to the wise."
1,"I have been vegetarian for about 5-6 years and generally I can eat about anything.  I may not love it, but I can eat it.  First, this stuff smells horrible.  They say to rinse them to get rid of the smell.  You can't completely get rid of the smell.  It smells like rotten fish or something. Second, the texture of this stuff makes me literally gag. I couldn't even swallow it, I had to spit it out.  If I want pasta I will eat pasta or even spagetti squash. But this stuff is not even edible in my book.  If I could give it -stars I would.  If your one of those people who have to try something for yourself, go to Whole Foods or a health food store and get just one pack first."
1,"The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a ""helpful review"", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself."
1,"I have bought greenies for my dog for 7 years (since she was a puppy). She has always had digestive problems, but we didn't know why. While googling greenies a couple of weeks ago, I found that several dogs have died because they were not able to digest greenies. Please do some research before buying this product again. It could save your dog's life. Since switching to another dog treat, my dog has not had any problems (although it has only been two weeks)."
1,"I get it on time, but when i count the total number of them i found one which was full of green hair on it!!!!, cant eat . I am pretty sure that it has gone  bad at LEAST few weeks!"
1,"I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee."
1,"found a small tear in the bag for my sugar to leak out.<br /><br />caster sugar is just processed white cane sugar anyway. run it in your food processor, you'll get the same product."
1,"The coffee is good but the price is ridiculous($1.25 each K-cup approx).  You can get it from Green Mountain for 75 cents a K-cup (delivered) which is still too much. Buy it for 60 cents a K-cup at Bed, Bath and Beyond or Kohls."

1,"I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one."
1,"i planted the seeds on dec. 26 so its been almost 2 months....i am still waiting for them to germinate.<br />the instructions did say 2 to 3 months....so we will wait a few more weeks."
1,"I normally like Kind bars, but the mango flavored ones are way too sweet. I don't even know how to describe the overpowering flavor. It tastes like the bars were sprayed with perfume and then dipped in tropical syrup. They could have made the mango flavoring a little more subtle."
1,"This is without a doubt the worst concoction that we have ever tried and I am amazed that anyone can stomach it. Nothing but a bland mix of goo with tons of pepper and spices added to cover it up. Same applies to the other Shore Lunch meals we tried! Do yourself a favor and leave them alone!"
1,"Zico used to be my coconut water of choice. When I first saw the new packaging I was excited that it would be easier to close and store. I was shocked when I tasted it - it is NOT the same product! The taste really turned me off. I've since switched to O.N.E. coconut water.<br /><br />I also determined that the new bottle size is too big of a serving. I like to drink coconut water before going to the gym because I've found it helps with endurance. It is not as convenient for me to carry the larger (by about 3 oz.) bottle, especially since I can't finish the entire thing in one sitting."

1,"These are really, really, bad.  I got them as a lightening deal and wouldn't encourage anyone to buy these.  As a previous reviewer stated, they have a terrible chemical taste to them.  I'm really disappointed in these.  Save your money and buy EAS, Balance, or any other power bar but this brand.  I mean, they are just awful."
1,"I ordered 2 cans on Amazon.com with this vendor because S&H was free. Please STAY AWAY from this INDIRECT VENDOR: Amazon does neither  store nor ship the product. The cans arrived both badly bashed in from Phoenix AZ, although the well-packed box containing them showed NO damage whatsoever. The vendor had knowingly shipped damaged products.<br />I gave a 1 star rating solely to alert customers not to order from this vendor. The Marron spread, of course, is always 5 star: same great taste and same iconic label as decades ago! Yes, it is the flavor of my childhood!<br />Subsequently, I ordered product from Lepicerie.com  (""The grocery store"" in French) where a 6-pack (same net weight per can) cost me a little over $8.00 per can INCLUDING S&H. I returned the damaged cans using Amazon's free shipping label. As always Amazon provides excellent customer service."
1,"I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.  The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!"
1,"This was ""free"" when you ordered another item. I'm glad we did not ""pay"" for it. It did not have that rich choc flavor...instead it was bland and tough. I'd bet they were ""free"" since they seemed stale."
1,"Bought this trap at my local Menards hardware store.  Seemed ok at first...directions say make sure the lever is outside the metal plate, then set it (after properly placing it in the soil).  It 'set' once.  Didn't catch or kill anything when it went off.  Could never get to 'set' again.  There is a video on youtube where a guy says, ""A lot of people are having trouble setting these traps"".... then shows you how to do it.  Only thing is, the one you have in your hand will not set like the one in the video.  Completely useless.  I wouldn't take this trap if somebody tried to give me one.<br /><br />If that many people are having trouble setting this trap after following the directions then its a problem with the product.  I now use the spikes from the trap (useless for killing moles) to cook meat cubes on the grill."
1,"I bought this product to keep my boxer entertained. She is very food motivated and very smart. The problem is that she tries to get the food out by any means necessary. This results in her being very ruff on the toy. I had to take it away for fear that she would break it."
1,"I bought 2 containers of this honey. I did not expect it to be this disgusting. I'm unable to eat it to see if it works. Oh well. To each his own. My boyfriend thought it was terrible too."
1,"This tea has a nice taste but is not very decaffinated. My husband has rather significant reactions caffinated beverages. I thought this would be a step up in quality from the local decaffeinated tea from the grocery store. It is a nice blend from a taste angle but left the consumer with vertigo - dizzy, headache and nausia. In fairness to the tea he tried it a second time and had the same reaction. If you are looking for a less caffinated tea this might be fine but it is certainly not decaffeinated."
1,"I love sunflower seeds, and I agree with the other two low reviews that these seeds are raunchy...but not in a good way. I gave just one seed to a colleague and he responded that ""it wasn't a pleasant experience."" They taste like they've been washed in Dial soap, which is emphasized and highlighted by the jalepe&ntilde;o flavoring.<br /><br />I know this because I've had my mouth washed out before as a kid.<br /><br />The David Buffalo Ranch flavored seeds also have that strange and repulsive chemical taste, but not as pronounced as these hot flavored ones.<br /><br />Stick to the Frito Lay seeds. They might not be jumbo, but they don't taste like they were made in Detroit.<br /><br />P.S. baseball players chew too, but that don't make it appropriate, or a baseball player an authority by any stretch of the imagination. But good for you, you baseball player you."
1,"Yuck!  Moldy. For the price, they should be mold free. I ate one before I noticed the mold, and it tasted good, but GROSS!  MOLD!"
1,"FYI: The ""Natural flavors"" claimed on the container appear to be ""dust"" and ""all-purpose flour,"" and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never ""mix"" with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk."
1,"Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee."
1,"Think carefully before ordering this product. My experience wasn't good. I don't care for the taste and it gave me unpleasant indigestion. Perhaps some people can digest this stuff, but not me. You have to buy two at a time so it's a risk if you don't like the taste or if it gives you digestion problems, because IT'S A NON-RETURNABLE ITEM. Obviously, many people are fine with this product, but caveat emptor."
1,"i was wondering why it was so much cheaper than the other flavors... now I know... my cat wouldnt touch it. He acted like it stunk and backed away.<br />he then went over to eat his day old dried cat food rather than eat this junk.<br />Im concerned that someone wrote it might be tainted and be recalled later. well ill save it in case it does get recalled-maybe then i can get a refund. i dont like how amazon wont let you return food items(unless recalled), especially when they are just unopened cans.<br /><br />alot of people gave it good ratings but alot of people didnt.. I think if you only have one cat like me, the odds are bad... and you shouldnt buy it."
1,"I just received this box of ""Green Tea with Ginger.""  I brewed one cup each for my husband and myself, but there was no ginger taste, and the tea was dark in color. I checked the ingredients list on the box, and it is actually green tea with blackberry leaf!! Ginger was listed last on the list, an indication there is less of it than blackberry leaf. I wanted the taste of ginger; NOT the overwhelming taste of blackberry which I DO NOT CARE FOR and would never knowingly buy!! When I went online to Amazon Returns, it said ""this item cannot be returned!!' This is terribly unfair, and this experience has lowered my estimation of Amazon.com.  Whatever happened to ""quality control?"""
1,"willcontinue to purchase from, but this order was stale. first time in years it has happened."
1,"I was very excited to try this coffee flavor, but when I did, I was very dissapointed.  I think the flavor is too strong, especially since it tastes really fake.  It almost tastes like there is alcohol in it.  Since I ordered the double box, I gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. I would never buy this coffee again."
1,"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a ""fair shake"", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a ""bad batch"" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat ""favorites"" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into ""fish broth"", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on ""fish water"" doesn't sound like a good deal to me."
1,"Get that diet taste in a non diet soda........  enough said.<br />If you use the Soda Stream, buy the bag in a box brand name soda syrup."
1,"i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place. I dont know what to do with the whole 4 box, i wasnt even able to drink up the one single cup!"
1,"Taking just one tablespoon once convinced me it is not for me. It gave me high Blood Pressure."
1,"i bought this because i could not find it at local stores.  however, later noted product was much cheaper locally, so could not recommend buying this product."
1,"I purchased these Pepperidge Farm cookies for a family member that is sick in the hospital. The cookies had an expiration date of 5/2/2012 but they were STALE. This was very embarrassing and disappointing to say the least. This tells me that food products are not a good buy from Amazon."
1,"this candy is nasty as H E Double Hockeysticks... omg it taste like old people candy or like or your average run of the mill generic candy. it's nothing that you havent tasted before but please dont waste your money on this nasty candy"
1,"My dog just didn't like the taste of them which surprised me since he likes food.  Tried each flavor same result.  I cannot recommend."
1,"Here is my rant on the ""new"" Kraft Catalina dressing. It is the vilest and nastiest stuff I've ever put in my mouth!!! I HATE it! I called to complain on their 800 number and the minimum-wage phone jerk told me how they put all their products under taste testing samples and market research. Well, those people they tested must not have any taste buds. Regardless, we don't have Catalina dressing anymore and I don't believe that Kraft is going to listen to us. While this decision is similar to the Coca-Cola disaster in 1985, it doesn't have the same economic impact that the Coke had. Millions of people don't consume Catalina every second of every day like Coke does, so while Kraft might notice some sales declines, I think their stubborn, marketing-minded mentality will keep the new product on the shelves. Too many corporations these days are more concerned with dollars and ""new and improved"" products than maintaining tried-and-true products with loyal customers. These corporations are being infiltrated with young college graduates who don't know, nor care, about value and time-honored traditions. For them, everything is about dumping the old simply because it's old and not relevant anymore. This is happening in all areas of our lives. Anyway, in my refund check from Kraft, they thanked me for being a loyal Kraft customer and looked forward to my continued support. They are so large that they don't have a clue as to what's going on. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I told that phone jerk that I was boycotting ALL products that Kraft makes. I am very angry that they messed with this dressing. I have found an alternative at Wal-Mart. They have their Great Value brand dressing in Honey French and Homestyle French flavors. The better of the two is the Honey French; however, if you combine the two dressings in equal amounts you have a nice tasting French dressing very similar to Catalina. Of course, if you go with the Honey French by itself, it is very similar to the Catalina taste. All that said, the old Catalina had the best balance of flavors and zinginess that I liked. It's so sad!"
1,"We love these truffles. I just received them after waiting many weeks. When they arrived they were all, and I mean all were melted. They were put in a box with popcorn around them. I was very disappointed with the way they shipped them. I think they should be shipped with some ice packs to protect them from melting. I will not order from these people ever again. Hugh mistake in packaging!!!"
1,"My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet."
1,"Not good at all. Strange flavors that I can't identify from the ingredient list, which sounds pretty good. These ones are going in the trash."
1,"This product was REALLY BAD.<br />When it arrived, after opening one of the energy bars, it looked like it had melted and also had some white fuzzy stuff all over it.<br />YUCK!<br />Because this was so bad, I hesitate to buy more food products from Amazon grocery. I've asked Amazon to resolve this."
1,"There are no instructions included with the product to indicate how to apply the mineral oil based therapy treatment beyond -- massage into hair and scalp. No guidance regarding quantity to use or length of time it should remain on the hair before it is rinsed out or if the treatment should be left on the hair, etc.<br /><br />And, the label states  --  provides light non-greasy nourishment to scalp and hair. Well, that is patently ridiculous. I tried it on dry hair and was left with a greasy mess. I tried it on wet hair and was left with a greasy mess. The first ingredient in the product is mineral oil, and it makes a big greasy mess. On the plus side, the scent is light and pleasant.<br /><br />If there is a trick to using this product that would permit a decent result I don't know what it is. As it stands, I'm a little put-off that decent instructions aren't provided. Why are we left to guess how the product should be applied?"
1,"I love Newman's products, but my dog hated it.  We purchased a case hoping to feed our dog something that doesn't contain all of the artificial chemicals, but he wanted nothing to do with it!  If you like organic, support Newman's products.  Hopefully your dog will like it better."
1,"This has a metallic edge to it and always ruins whatever concoction I use it in.  I forgot about it and used one of these vile vials that were gathering dust.  Never again."
1,"This frosting is sweet, and it is low in calories.  Whenever I come across the term &quot;cloying&quot; I think of this frosting.  It is sweet and sticky and has an obvious chemical taste.  I also have had difficulty obtaining a frosting like consistency.  I enjoy using the Sweet 'N Low cake mixes so the first few times I used this product I assumed I had not followed the directions properly. (Okay, so the directions were basically to add water and beat.)  If you have to have sugar free frosting on your cake I suggest using the Sans Sucre brand dessert mousse mix and spreading it quickly on the cake as you would a whipped frosting."
1,"Like other reviewers, I bought this tea because the box clearly states ""Formerly Indian Spiced Chai"". It is absolutely disgusting. While I was first upset that it tasted nothing like the Indian Spiced Chai, that was quickly replaced by anger as I realized that what I was drinking simply tasted bad. Totally gross. DO NOT buy this if you're looking for chai, or even for a tea that tastes good. I wish I could give zero stars."
1,"I'm hoping to receive this soon.  I like Swiss Colony's offerings and want to get this candy out and in dishes well before Christmas.  It has been a while since I ordered it."
1,"This product closely resembles the gluten free variety and does not do enough to demonstrate the difference. My wife has celiac disease, we bought this inadvertently and cannot return it."
1,"Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always! When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being ""basted"" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product"
1,"These are so gross I can't believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial-smelling fragrance. I am NOT that picky an eater and I generally love any GF cookie just b/c I am so grateful they exist. But OMG I immediately spit this out AND rinsed out my mouth! Even my snack-loving toddler didn't like these. Eating them, that is. She did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all. What a mess. And what a waste of money."
1,"Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!"
1,"Yup you might taste cheddar if you do not mind dumping 1/2 bottle in your popcorn. You would be better off purchasing a good brand of cheddar cheese and grating it on top of your popcorn."
1,"If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage."
1,"We got a new K-Cup machine and were very excited to try the hot chocolate.  It was not good at all; it was like drinking hot water with a very, VERY slight taste of some sort...possibly chocolate.  I would not purchase this item again."
1,"Used to be made in america now there soggy not chewy and made in mexico!No wonder the price has dropped at the local store $2.59 for this box."
1,"Love the other flavors...this one is horrible.  And I cannot return...oops.  This flavor is almost a chemical one, does not taste anything like cheddar and my kids thought the same!"
1,"Have we become so lazy we need an expensive 2 oz container to give us the healthy energy we can get for much less money, via eating healthy fruits, vegetables and buying a bottle of B Complex vitamins?  As Dr Oz and other medical professionals note, if the label has something on it you cannot pronounce don't buy it.<br /><br />Bear in mind the 2 oz container has 160 mg of caffeine, compared to 1 cup of brewed coffee which has  80-135 mg. Or an Espresso cup which has 100 mg. And coffee is meant to be drunk and enjoyed slower.  I just don't think the 160 in on shot is healthy.<br /><br />As for taste, the berry flavour was akin to some cherry Kool Aid loaded with sugar, with an after taste. Yuck!  And the stuff can make you hyper if you are not a caffeine drinker of any kind be it coffee or soda drinks."
1,"I ordered this for my sister because we used to eat these when we were little. Three months after she gets them, I visit her and see that she only ate about half of them and was planning to give the other half away part of xmas gifts.  Why you ask? Because I purchased them on Amazon, not knowing that they were sour squeeze pops.  Everyone likes the sweet ones and the sweet ones were the original squeeze pops.  All the other vendors title the sour squeeze pops ""sour squeeze pops"", but these guys didn't even have the decency to put the word ""sour"" anywhere in the description.  The only way to know that you are ordering the sour version is to enlarge the picture of the item and hunt for the word ""sour"" on the box.  I felt deceived, and would rather do business with another vendor for a buck or two more than a dishonest one."
1,"In principle a Splenda Margarita mix sounded like a great idea. The execution was terrible. I poured both of my two bottles down the drain. You would have to be pretty desparate, or otherwise never have had a decent margarita if this was your choice. I would rather skip altogether, as one of the other reviewers had suggested as well. The market has a long way to go to support less sugar in drinks."
1,"Made Cajun chicken pasta with this seasoning and it was so salty that I had to throw out a huge pot. Nobody in my family could eat it. My husband complained that his tongue still felt swollen from the salt hours later. If you use this seasoning, limit it to the amount you would use if it was pure salt."
1,"It sucked, cause I never got it, until this day I never heard from the sender, the good think was that I got my money back."
1,"This product came to me in a brown paper bag!  That's right, 35 individual K-Cups just thrown in a bag and mailed! Oh, I almost forgot, it was a stapled bag tossed in a box with air pillows...What kind of business packages their product this way! Very professional."
1,"Title says it all. I thought ""Twizzlers"" were bad but ""Red Vines"" are much worse. Don't waste Your $$ on this turkey!"
1,"I had so much hope for this product. I had the hardest time getting the horrible bean taste out of my mouth. If you make the mistake of trying it, drink some milk. That's the only thing that help. Otherwise if you can have rice, look up a good simple recipe using rice flour. That's what I do now and they are wonderful."
1,"The berry flavor was okay on first bite, but then the after taste hit. Couldn't eat but maybe half of bar. Not sure what I will do with the rest now."
1,"As with any food product, your opinion may differ. I found that this meal was very short on flavor, and not visually appealing. It does not look at all like the picture on the cover. The pasta, the chicken and the 'sauce' were all the same color. The 'sauce' appeared to be some melted cheese food product. I should have tried this first from the (more expensive) store that sells them in units, not packages, because with this item, eating it once was more than enough."
1,"I've ordered these before and they were wonderful. Now they are terrible. They are much harder and taste like candy hearts. They must have changed the formula. Not worth buying or eating."
1,"I had hoped when I bought it that it would replace the original Chicken Free Ramen soup but it's as horrible as the new chicken free soup. I loved the original and I do not understand why they would replace it with these vegan soups that just plain taste awful.<br />My advice-save your money."
1,"My coworkers and I purchased this cinnamon to create gingerbread ornaments with our students.  We mixed the cinnamon with applesauce (something we've done for years) but as we mixed we discovered this cinnamon to have many pieces of white fibers mixed in!  The white fibers looked like tiny, white strings.  We continued on with the project because we knew we would not be eating it but soon we discovered, the cinnamon didn't even work for the ornaments.  The ornaments crumbled apart once they were dry rather than sticking together.  Lets just say, I'm so thankful we did not purchase this cinnamon to bake with or to eat!!  We were so excited to the GREAT deal on cinnamon but in the end it was not worth it.  We have had to repurchase cinnamon at our local grocery store."
1,"Don't take offense, I fed this brand for years. But, a look at the ingredients shows that it is garbage. No wonder our pets are suffering so many diseases that could be prevented with proper nutrition. Corn, wheat how this crap is legally sold as dog food or even touted as ""wholesome"" is beyond me.<br /><br />Want a starter book on the horrors of the pet food industry? ""Food Pets Die For"", check it out<br /><br />we switched to a more natural kibble several years ago but even then the years of feeding junk food did its damage. Our Dane was diangosed with lymphoma, and since has been switched to raw pet food such as Nature's Variety and Primal. If you love your pet, at least check them out. They are pricey, but for a healthier/longer life, well worth it."
1,"When I saw that Amazon was selling a SharkBanana, I thought this was some sort of genetically engineered hybrid, perhaps the equivalent of childhood favorite sea monkeys, but for the new age.<br /><br />I ordered a gross of these using Prime 2 day shipping, and as I am very busy as the CEO of a major corporation, I didn't have time to fully research this item. But I expected something like this: You receive your SharkBananana embryos, put them in water, and watch them grow to be full fledged SharkBananas. I planned to include these in the gift boxes I send to my best clients, along with a Coach wallet, some Godiva chocolates, and a few other high end goodies that go with that sort of thing.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise, and disappointment, when I got my pallet of boxes from Amazon and all each contained was this stuffed animal thing. No embryos. Not even any real bananas, which I sort of figured that--for the price they're asking--they'd probably include. In fact, I specifically ordered a banana essence truffle from Godiva to go with these.<br /><br />There is no way I am going to be able to put these in my gift boxes.<br /><br />Buyer beware: These are neither real sharks, nor real bananas.<br /><br />'nuff said."
1,"Unfortunately a long delay in notification from seller regarding replacement of shipment damage replacement. Seller either unorganized to too big to respond?  Had ordered a case of coconut milk, 12 32 0z. pack. Unfortunate. Cnut Milk, 70+% Organic, Van, Asep, S, 32 oz (pack of 12 )"
1,"I have three cats, and even the chow-hound (the one who will eat anything, even, frequently, the inedible) will not touch this stuff.  The same is true for the only other flavor in the Newman's Own Organics line we've tried (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139C3P2"">Newman's Own®Organics Chicken & Salmon Formula For Cats, 3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 24)</a>).  I'd like to donate the rest to an animal shelter, but I wish I knew why my own cats find it so offensive!"
1,"Let's start this with Amazon took care of the issue with this product promptly and courteously so FIVE STARS for them.  Now the abysmal packaging and quantity/quality of this product.  Run, stay away, don't think about it, just keep moving along.  Not in a holiday box but in a brown box with a 11""x14"" piece of colored paper that can be taped to the front to cover the cellophane. And no little view hole either like the picture.  The brown box it comes in is about 5"" deep but the interior brown box of contents is supported by 3"" of cardboard underneath. The 2"" deep contents box has 1"" of scrap paper pressing the contents into the cellophane.  So what is in that 1""x11""x14""?  Not much! 1 packet of hot chocolate for a 6 oz cup?  That's like a shot.  The littlest 3-4 packages of other stuff not worth mentioning but think 1/3 the size of a small kids lunch bag of chips.  The mustard is in a jar smaller than what the airlines serve jelly in. (1 Oz).  The cheese wheel is more cardboard and little cheese.  The knife to cut the cheese came out of some playdooh set.<br /><br />Let's just say this isn't worth $5 and due to the packaging, it can't be gifted without shame."
1,"This product is excellent but you have to carefully watch what you are paying for.  Some sellers are selling 6 bars for almost the same price as 12 and if you're not paying attention you could get caught."
1,"I bought these in bulk so had no choice but to try them for quite a while before giving up.  I just noted that I agreed with review of Ms. Hampton.  They are loaded processed peanut and cocoa butter fats, which can't be good. I did not lose any weight but gained.  It wasn't until I switched to a rice protein drink that I lost and I know it was the bars because I didn't make any other changes but to substitute the bars for the rice drinks.<br /><br />I also tried all the flavors but none tastes good.  I will not be making any more orders of these bars."
1,"The cans are from Thailand. The exp date on the bottom of all the cans received reads 07. The contents of the only can I opened are solid, like a rock... There is very little moisture left in the can. It looks like a relabeled can. Amazon refunded my purchase price - I love Amazon :) peace"
1,"I will admit at this moment I have no hard data to back up my suspicion, but we have been feeding these to our two dogs, one of whom is diabetic. Due to the fact that the chicken and apple treats boasted such bona fides as ""no hormones"" and ""no antibiotics"", we felt good about serving these up.<br /><br />The other day, the diabetic dog began throwing up, and I took her to the vet yesterday. The vet called with the results of the blood work and said the dog's liver enzymes had spiked. She asked me if we were feeding her chicken jerky treats which might be made in China. I knew about the Dogswell treats, but I was certain they weren't of Chinese origin. When I was at the store later, I picked up a package and found to my amazement that they are, in fact, Chinese.<br /><br />The vet will run tests on the remaining treats in the package to see if there is any melamine in the meat, but the change in her liver coincides with her getting these treats. I wouldn't advise anyone feeding these to their dogs without first checking the health of their dog's liver and the chemical composition of the treats.<br /><br />Rated One Star, only because Zero Stars is not an option."
1,"I had a terrible experience ordering from this company.<br />Customer service treated me like a criminal."
1,"I rarely give anything a 1 star review, but if Amazon would allow us to give no stars, that's what they be getting. This assortment came free with my new soda-stream. Every single one contains artificial sweetener. They taste absolutely disgusting. Don't even think about it."
1,"I got a box of these yesterday, and at first I thought they were actually spoiled.  After I re-read the reviews, I realized that they are just that bad.  I usually try to throw in a positive, but I just cannot think of one.  If they tasted good and the carbs were not nearly as high (24g per bar) I would be happy to pay the money, but for how bad they taste and how they really aren't very low-carb diet friendly, 1 star.  Really, though, I wish they would have stated the carb count on the ad."
1,"This candy was gummy and Inedible..  I dont know whether it was old or handled improperly but it went into the trash immediately."
1,"These cookies are ""okay"" not great, I guess I had higher expectations of what to expect, but it seems so many of the chocolate chip cookies out there are ""healthy"" rather than being good cookies like you would make in your own kitchen..."
1,"We bought 2 of the 6 paks for Just the Cheese Butter Flavor Popped Cheese.  The 6 individual bags held about 15-18 pieces of the popped cheese.  Thank goodness the popped cheese pieces were flavored in butter an did have that buttery flavor.  However, when the butter flavors go, you feel like you are eating rice cakes with zero taste. I'll not make this mistake again."
1,"Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!"
1,"During a scooter tour of the southwest (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizon), a group of us decided to try one of the 5 hour energy drinks (I think I had the Berry 1.93 ounce, regular strength).  I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).<br /><br />Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.  For me at least, the bad reaction was enough to warn me away from trying these ever again."
1,"I usually order the unsweetened flaked coconut and it's fantastic. I saw that this was twice the amount of coconut in a package for less then double the price but it was shredded.  I tried it and now am I sorry.  It's shredded but it's so finely shredded it flies everywhere and sticks to everything and leaves no taste at all.  I am so very disappointed. Will go back to the flaked and never order this again!"
1,"Everyone of the cans were severely dented and all of the dented sides were carefully placed so could not see them. The cans were shrink-wrapped and packed in plastic air bags, there was no damage to the box they arrived in, so they were dented when packed."
1,"Oberto must have changed its formula. This is not the taste of the original Oberto I used to eat 3-4 years ago. What happened? I ended up giving the bag away."
1,"I was so hoping that the other reviews were wrong and these wouldn't taste burnt. But, allas they are a dark dark brown color and 95% of the 2 bags i opened were brunt and nasty. Amazon was GREAT though. They refunded the money and I will give them to the food shelf."
1,"The most I can say about this product is that it has an interesting label. I had a palm full which left a terrible bitter taste in my mouth for six hours until dinner when it started to go away. I didn't feel so good either. The pieces were very stuck together and some appeared to have very tiny pieces of leaf attached to them. I have purchased several other brands from local natural food stores with no problem whatsoever, so I figured that all would be well to order something unknown online. I also didn't want to run out of goji berries and have to pay for shipping very soon, so I ordered to two sets which totals four bags. I finished my supply from the natural food store today, and I started on the Extreme Health which is one day beyond the Amazon.com return policy. Therefore I'll have to throw in the trash about $60. LESSON: Never order any food that you're not sure about even if it has a pretty label and/or try it out before one month or you can't return it to Amazon.com."
1,"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food."
1,"I just got these today and they had almost all leaked. Every box was soaked with juice. Instead of 4 boxes of juice, I got a HUGE MESS to clean up."
1,"Bought this for my daughter-in-law, who is from Japan. She was excited to be able to grow fresh Japanese herbs indoors. Unfortunately, a couple of the pods never sprouted, and the others that did took such a long time and ultimately ended up dying shortly after coming up. I have purchased other seed kits from Aerogrow and have had great success. This one was a dud. After the fact, I did some research and found that others had marginal success, so not sure if it was something we did, or just a bad batch of seeds. Amazon was great about refunding the full purchase price, and I thought about purchasing another to see if we would have better luck, but decided against it based on the few reviews I read. Maybe others will have better luck."
1,"JUST GOT THIS SEASONING LAST NIGHT AND MADE SOME TURKEY TACOS WITH IT.....THEY WERE EXTREMELY NASTY.....ABSOLUTELY NO FLAVOR.....I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT ITS A NO SALT SEASONING BUT MAN , IT TASTED HORRIBLE AND HAS MADE ME SICK. I WILL JUST TRY A LOW SALT TACO SEASONING UNTIL I FIND A NO SALT ONE THAT IS AT LEAST BAREABLE AND DOESNT MAKE ME SICK....UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS....."
1,"I ordered several 6 pks. thinking this was going to be great teasting and it was terrible...very strong tasting. My husband is Indian and we both love curry. I made the Chicken Curry with the paste accoring to directions and it tasted stale & flat for lack of a bettr description. Of course we have eaten some of the best chicken curry around so maybe that is why we did not like it. Also the rice mix was the absolute worst, gummy and stuck together..ended up tossing the entire purchase."
1,"The old formula, which doesn't contain almonds, is oustanding; I would put a very thin layer on a slice of bread and I could say it is like heaven. The new formula tastes different, looks different....and I would simply not buy it again. I would try to see if Target has any left in stock though the last jar I bought there had an expiration of May. It is truly dissapointing for the company to go the cheap route and change the formula without surveying its customers first. Market share is hard to gain and easy to lose. There are a couple of other brands of chocolate hazelnut butter on the market and I am willing to give the Italian one a shot."
1,"This vanilla has sugar in it.  Nowhere in the description does it specify that, but on the ingredient list on the label it does. This isn't the real thing at all, which would explain the price.  Shame on Amazon/seller for not listing all ingredients on this product. I buy from Amazon weekly, and this is the first purchase I've made that's made me feel taken."
1,"These bars are normally good but the shipment we got was moldy and inedible.  Amazon's customer service was very helpful, agreeing to send a replacement box without requiring us to send the bad bars back.  Unfortunately the second shipment was every bit as moldy as the first.<br /><br />I would not order from this vendor again until they get their act together."
1,"These were gross. It was like chomping down on a chunk of salt. I regret wasting my money and will not purchase in the future"
1,"I decided to try this ""treat"" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
1,"I had a bad infestation of pantry moths and tried this brand but was very disappointed to find that the area where the moths stick is very small even though the cardboard trap is as large as the other competitors traps.  The sticky area fills up with moths and wing scale very quickly and then is totally useless even though it is supposed to last for three months.  Poor Design.... I guess they want you to buy a lot of these.  Check out the other brands.  The best I found are the Pro-Pest Pheronet Brand.  It is here on Amazon:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F0UOJY"">Pantry Moth Traps - Set of Three</a>"
1,"The Merchant ""OCHUN"" has prices 100% higher than others. Their price is higher than if you bought the coffee at your local Starbucks or grocery store.Direct from a Starbucks store the price is less and you get 25% more coffee (12oz vs 16oz bags). I won't do business with ""OCHUN"" and suggest you don't either until they get their prices in line. VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FROM ""OCHUN"" Shop around."
1,"I love these cookies.  So I decided to order them in bulk.  They arrived stale and smashed.  I will be cancelling my next order.  I was very disappointed."
1,"My son LOVES HappyBellies Oatmeal, so I tried the Multigrain and he loved it, too. So did I, until I read the ingredients and noticed that they added glucose to make the cereal sweet. No extra sugar for my darling. Back to the oatmeal version for us since it's naturally sweet. As he's now 10 months old, I'm exposing him to other grains, like quinoa (which is in the multigrain)and complementing his daily grains with the HB oatmeal to get all those good vitamins and probiotics and DHA."
1,"I HATED this coffee.  I'm much more of a Starbucks or Peet's loyalist, so maybe I'm a bit spoiled.  But after reading many positive reviews of this company I decided to give it a try.  Big mistake.  I had a hard time giving it away.  It definitely tastes like chicory.  Blagk.  Bad news."
1,"I love oatmeal and I usually eat the Archer Farms organic brand from Target. Thought I'd give these a go, but it was nasty. I couldn't make myself choke down the whole carton. This was the second flavor I tried -- the first was the Cherry Pistachio, which was even worse and gave me a stomach ache for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I thought the ingredients sounded promising: WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, MULTI GRAIN BLEND (WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, ROLLED BARLEY, WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED RYE), DRIED SWEETENED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR), DRIED SWEETENED CRANBERRIES (CRANBERRIES, SUGAR), WALNUTS COATED WITH ROSEMARY EXTRACT, BROWN SUGAR, DEHYDRATED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR, FRUCTOSE, CINNAMON, MALIC ACID, SODIUM SULFITE FOR COLOR RETENTION), WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED WHEAT, SALT, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVOR.<br /><br />Part of the problem, for me, was that they're just too sweet. But part of the problem was also that they had a ""weird"" aftertaste. Kind of metallic and ""off."" I don't know how else to describe it. Something that doesn't taste like oatmeal or fruit or nuts. Maybe it's from the ""natural flavors""?<br /><br />Of course, individual experiences will vary from mine. But I think I'll stick with the old-fashioned way. It's a lot cheaper and healthier to just make regular oatmeal and add your own ""flavors"" -- fruit, nuts, maple syrup, whatever -- and it won't leave a bunch of little cartons to recycle or go in the landfill."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6GAMK"">McKay's Chicken Style Instant Broth & Seasoning, Vegan, 12 oz</a><br /><br />This product states that it is ""a complete vegan product""; however, the 3rd ingredient on the label is ""lactose (milk)"" and the 4th ingredient is ""whey (milk)"". Animal products are not vegan! It shouldn't be a hit for a vegan broth search on Amazon, either. I am sending this one back!"
1,"I never ever review products on Amazon. This is my first. I love MIO Fruit Punch. This was so foul- I actually threw it away after 1 drink. It doesn't taste like sweet tea at all."
1,"I buy and eat a lot of almomds. I make almond milk and almond butter. I usually buy almonds from the produce section in Walmart. Walmart almonds are always fresh. Many times Walmart doesn't have them in the produce section because they sell out. These almonds are soft and do not taste fresh. The almond butter doesn't have a good flavor when I use these.I'll stick with Walmart and will not be ordering these again."
1,"This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on the internet, and I'm a frequent consumer of online purchases.  Firstly, this product was not shipped 3 weeks after I ordered it.  After emailing the company inquiring into my order, I was informed that they would now ship my product - 3 weeks after the order date!  Upon arrival of the purchase, I noticed a misshapen box on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box, I discovered my Fruit Snacks box was misshapen and squished, because it was placed in a shipping box that was smaller than the fruit snacks box, totally ruining the shape and appearance of the Fruit Snacks box.  In addition, under the fruit snacks box was a crumpled packing slip, which included a coupon for 5% off my next purchase from this company.  It's too bad the coupon expired 3 days before I even received the fruit snacks box, since the coupon was printed three weeks prior, when I actually ordered the thing.<br /><br />Tl;dr DO NOT purchase stuff from this company.  It is worth the extra time needed to find another supplier or buying it from the store.  I paid more for this product than it's price at costco citing convenience due to not having to leave my home, and ended up experiencing the worst online purchase in my 10 years of purchasing history."
1,"All of them were melted and stuck to the inside of the packaging. Even tried to refrigerate some to no avail.  Freezer same outcome. Stuck very firmly to the packaging and fell apart trying to separate. Don't buy."
1,"After consuming this product, it left a very unpleasant ""aftertaste"" and ""film"" on my tongue.  I enjoy hard candy with fruit fillings but definitely would not recommend this one!!"
1,"What is 'Salmon Trout' ? Salmon and trout are two different fish. Is this a mistake or a new species I'm unaware of."
1,"My best friend came over three weeks ago and I had made Tabbouleh, but made with Quinoa instead of Bulgar. He loved it, in fact, everyone that I had try it was hooked. But then he mentioned that real Tabbouleh is made with Bulgar and that we should try that to see how it would work out... so he went on a quest and found this product on Amazon. I have to say, if I would have known that he was purchasing a product that all the ingredients was inclusive, this product would have never been purchased. Not to be offensive, but his is a product for people that are either lazy, non-cooks, on the run, or that just don't care about their health. If you are going to make Tabbouleh, make it with FRESH ingredients.<br /><br />So, my friend ordered it... it came in two days and when opening the two boxes... yes, it was very nicely packaged, but even at that, two packs were broken and the content was all inside the box... not a big deal. but then is when I noticed that the product he (my friend) had ordered, was an all inclusive product. I cringed, and figured I would try it and give it a shot. If you like lemons... lots of lemons, you might enjoy this product. It was so bad, that I called amazon, told them I was highly dissatisfied and I was refunded the complete purchase price.<br /><br />This is a perfect example of a company processing ingredients together to make it easy for the consumer, but please do yourself a favor, if you are going to make and serve such a delicate dish, USE FRESH ingredients. This is a super food that should never be sold all inclusive."
1,"I never tasted bagel snacks that are so awful tasting as these. Too bad I bought 2 of them. Poppy Seed flavor? I thought they have a fishy flavor to me. and like they say, they are twice baked.... just under burnt they are. YUCK.... at least my pigs do like them! They are a snack to them!!"
1,"I was so disappointed!  I received the cups and tried one right away.  It was like hot water.  The cups felt empty so I opened one to see.  The ""cider"" had melted or something, causing the cups to be empty.  I thought maybe one or two could be bad, but it was the whole box!  Soooo disappointed!"
1,"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee."

1,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

1,"Bentley's Unflavored White Tea used to be the best white tea ever. Subtle delicious flavor. They used to have the green labels back then. When they moved to the black labels, the quality went down. Now they have a third version with a new black label, which is even worse. It takes two bags to make a cup and the taste is no where near the original. I've tried writing to Bentley and have had no response from them. I'm cancelling my subscription."
1,"Overall decent taste, but not what I expected.  Also did not expect this to be coconut water from CONCENTRATE. I will read the fine print better next time.  100% pure coconut water is always better IMHO.<br /><br />The added sugar would not really be necessary if it's pure coconut water, not from concentrate."
1,"I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS."
1,"After reading all the glowing reviews about this coffee, I couldn't resist ordering some - especially at the great price. YUK. I couldn't stand the taste. It didn't taste like coffee at all but some type of brown syrupy stuff. Ended up giving it away. I don't understand why this brand has so many loyal followers. I guess it's a regional thing."
1,"Though I ordered Weight watcher candy for my WW wife, what arrived was Russel Stover Sugar Free candy<br /><br />This wasn't an equivalent product but the shipper (Russell Stover) was unwilling to make it right,"
1,"I'm a HUGE fan of Seedlander<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KLSZGW"">Doctor Kracker Seedlander Organic Crispbreads, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. I go through a shipment of those every month. I wanted to try something else, and listened to the reviews. First of all, I'm not exactly sure what rosemary tastes like, but I have tried rosemary flatbread before and loved it. This cracker either has too much rosemary, or maybe something else I'm not aware of. Just my opinion on the taste. I really am going to give the unopened boxes to charity (a person who is hungry). I will keep these in my car because I know somebody less fortunate than me will really appreciate these. Hopefully, they like it as well as the other reviewers. Peace"
1,"Boy did I feel silly when I found this exact item at a specialty store downtown for $5.00. I paid $11.45 on Amazon.<br />Buyer BEWARE!"
1,"Been taking Stevia in the Raw for over 3 months believing it would be healthier for me considering diabetes runs in my family.  Well foolish me got sucker by Stevia in the Raw.  In small print the word DEXTROSE.  What is Dextrose?  Is a HIGH Glycemic Index, fast absorbing carbohydrate derived from corn.  Percentage of Corn - Genetically Modified. And how about the HIGH GLYCEMIC INDEX, not good for diabetics.  Definately not purchasing this again.  Also from what've read Truvia is no better - alcohol sugars.  Guess back to the drawing board.  Hopefully I can find a product that only has STEVIA and no other ingredrients."
1,"This tea is unpleasantly heavy on the cloves, which is an ingredient that should ALWAYS be used sparingly for just a hint of flavor. It completely burned out my palate."
1,"Unlike the other flavors of the Wish-Bone Salad Spritzers, this one contains monosodium glutamate, or MSG.  If you are sensitive to MSG avoid this product."
1,"this pipe is not very good while smoking your herbs tend to burn rapidly and embers shoot into your mouth it is very unpleasant"
1,"I purchased this in a grocery store, not amazon, but having read these reviews I wanted to offer my view. I absolutely cannot believe the other reviews that say it is good or the closest thing to natural peanut butter. Neither the texture nor the taste come close to even the cheapest supermarket brand peanut butter, never mind tasting like a quality natural product. It has intense off-flavors, somewhat reminiscent of tapioca gone bad, or perhaps it's something like a sweet chemical-like flavor/smell. And the texture is way wrong. It is too thin, almost liquidy. Just yuck. Better'n Peanut Butter isn't even better'n nothing."
1,"I won't say too much because I have always loved this product.  I have purchased these berries every month for the past year and have never had a problem before.  I need to contact the company."
1,"I wanted to make a black and white cake so I got this at a store near me. As soon as I got home I sprayed a tiny bit on my hand and licked it. It smelled and tasted horrible. I threw it out within minutes of coming home from the store. I own quite a few Wilton products but would advise against getting the black spray."
1,"After reading the reviews concerning the poor packaging, I purchased this and felt it would be worth the savings. It's not. Aside from the terrible packaging, it tastes awful. The German amber sugar from Teavana or TeaForte are all natural and delicious. This is just rock candy colored brown. NOT all natural and it shows in the taste. The description on these is ""Amber Sugar Crystals"". The box I received says ""Old Fashioned Rock Candy. Amber crystals made from Pure cane sugar, caramel color."" Do yourself a favor and pay the extra cash to have REAL amber rock sugar."
1,"Wasn't pleased with it. It contains aspartime, which I can't use. It didn't say when ordering it. I plan on returning them.."
1,"Will not be buying this flavor again.  My 10 month old will not eat it.  It is very thick, especially after being kept in the fridge after opeing."
1,"Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.  Stale airline coffee!  If you like that flavor, then you will love this one, if you don't like thin cardboard soaked, never washed the pot out, and the water came from a tin canteen, flavored coffee, then you won't like this one either!  I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!  The package says Extra Bold, but it doesn't taste extra bold.  It's almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger."
1,"I ordered these in the winter and they were ok.  But the last two orders which were in Spring and now in June came and were completely in a mangled mess of melted chocolate and broken pretzels.  Not at all appetizing, in fact disgusting.  After contacting the company and letting them know the problem they simply gave us a credit of $13 for our trouble.  That's laughable since the whole box is ruined and these pretzels are not cheap.  I order chocolate through the mail all the time from See's in California and have never had a problem with the chocolate melting to this degree.  Its a problem that you need to fix before I will ever be back."
1,"Bamboo sticks a strangely hollow and withered 2 weeks after I bought them, despite watering ... had to throw them out. Also, extremely overpriced for the amount you get."
1,"I'll admit: being married to cousinpaco can't be the easiest thing in the world -- among other things, the frequent, top-secret ninja missions take me away from home for long intervals.<br /><br />Still, marriage is a two-way street, and ol' cousinpaco has had to compromise here and there, believe you me.<br /><br />For instance, when it comes to Ginger Ale, I'm a die-hard Canada Dry man. ""Take off, eh"" is my motto. But cousinpaco's better half grew up drinking Vernors. Since she's the one who handles the grocery shopping, guess what's waiting for me in the fridge when I return from infiltrating secret bases to sabotage weather-dominating machines and such? Yep -- Vernors. Nothing against Vernors, of course...except that, to my palate, Vernors tastes like cough medicine.<br /><br />I know, I know -- I could get off my keister and buy my own soft-drinks. But when you're fighting a never-ending battle against morons who (for example) seek to conquer the world by building giant robotic dinosaurs, the last thing you want to do on weekends is wait in the grocery line behind some old lady who has thirty items in the Express Lane...and probably wants to pay with a check.<br /><br />So, that means I drink Vernors. It's the price of marriage, I s'pose.<br /><br />Thankfully, we both agree that toilet paper should pull from the top of the roll, not underneath. That would have been a deal-breaker."
1,"I really like this product but was very disappointed that it was broken when it came.  I can still use it but I bought both the pepper and salt so they would match and one of them has tape on the top of it now.  It was just too much trouble to send it back when I still could use it.  The Sea Salt itself is amazing, I use it for everything."
1,"We just bought 40 boxes of these from a local store to pass out to kids at a school after field day. After sampling them, though, we had to return them! One flavor was a brown/yellow color with flecks of deep brown, the other was a red/purple color--so we weren't at all sure which flavor was which. The red/purple color was very sweet and had a very odd flavor, kind of like apple cider but not exactly. Then we tried the brown ones. Ugh! They had a distinctly rotten fruit flavor with a hint of vinegar. Too late, we smelled them and realized they also smelled off. Obviously no one finished that flavor, but even after rinsing with water we could still taste that rottenness on our tongues. Thank goodness we tasted them before we gave them to the kids!<br /><br />Although the expiration date was 9 months from now, it's possible we just got a batch that had spoiled and the product is usually better. Still, if you order these I highly recommend that you smell them after opening but before tasting."
1,"I used to eat Marmitte when I lived in England. It is a salty and very tasty paste and it is absolutely delicious on toast with butter. Almost impossible to find it in America except on Amazon or in some gourmet stores or health stores like Whole food Market. The one I received 2 days ago had neither the usual interior seal or the plastic seal that normally cover the jar. I am sending it back!! So disappointing!!"
1,"Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state ""Artificial Sweetener"" and or ""Diet"" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?"
1,"I ordered SINF basmati rice and what arrived today is Nissan extra long grain rice.<br /><br />3 problems with the order:<br /><br />- what arrived is not the same as the product pictured above (not the SINF brand)<br />- this is not basmati rice, extra long grain is not the same as basmati<br />- I paid more than $22 for the 10 pound bag of SINF basmati rice ( compared with $17.50 which is what you would pay for 10 pound bag of the Nissan long grain rice)<br /><br />So I am not sure what happened here, I feel like I just paid a premium price for rice I didn't even want. So beware you won't get the rice which is pictured above and you will pay premium price for it too, such a disappointment. And to top it all, I don't even have an option to return it according to amazon's return policy even though it's sealed!"
1,"My cat loves Cat-man-doo, but b/c of the cost and someone's review of that product, recommending this, I tried this product instead.  She just ate some and THREW UP!!! She has never vomited anything and is a healthy cat, having just seen the vet for her well visit check. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR YOUR CAT111 I would give this product a MINUS five stars, if that were available. To make matters worse, Amazon's policy on this product was no returns, so I had to call them.  the woman was super nice, however, and issued me a refund saying to destroy the product in a way that other animals could not get into it. Now I have to take my cat to the vet."
1,"The peas are not green like the photo on the package, they don't taste like peas, and the coating doesn't taste like wasabi. All in all these are a failure."
1,"When looking at the product, I thought that it would be a good way to entertain my dogs. Unfortunately, after a few minutes of looking and pulling they gave up and never went back to the toy again. I think that the Kong is a superior toy to hide food and keep dogs occupied."
1,"When my regular buffalo jerky was discontinued from the subscribe & save program I chose this item.  I have had & enjoyed other Golden Valley products in the past so I chose this one without reading the reviews.  I was very disappointed.  I have never been one for reconstructed meat.  I never read the fine print-this purchase was my fault for not reading everything-I saw buffalo & peppered & got excited.  The pepper flavor is very weak and unexciting.  If you like reconstructed meat with very little pepper flavor then this is the item for you!"
1,"This company is scamming everyone.  They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it, it sounds like a little snarl drum.  As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square."
1,"When I went to my local QFC in Seattle, I was pressed for time to get to a memorial function, so when I found they only had this product and no powdered wasabi, I gave it a try.  I was bringing a smoked fish plate, and I wanted to make a wasabi mayonnaise to accompany the other usual sides for this appetizer.<br /><br />Interesting that the other ""terrible"" review said it tasted like it was blended with mayonnaise. Obviously, I WANTED it to taste like wasabi mayo, which I've made many times with excellent results, and why not? It's just wasabi and mayo!!!<br /><br />When I whipped this batch up at the function, it tasted excessively salty, almost like baking soda, which rendered it unservable. Lucky I had other condiments so no huge deal.<br /><br />I know I've used pre-made in the tube in the past, but this brand was truly awful. So, people, learn from my mistake: buy powder, add hot water, you're done-enjoy!"
1,"I've been on a low carb diet and bought these.  I wouldn't recommend them.  They aren't bad tasting especially if your craving chocolate/peanut butter.  I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one.  I have tried Atkin's products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs.  I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger.  In my opinion the Atkins taste 100 times better then the think thin bars.<br /><br />The Think Thin bars have 10 extra carbs then an Atkins bar.  They claim to be only 3 net carbs online but I think this is a lie."
1,"I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. ""They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.""  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  ""At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,""<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary."
1,"I expected something really delicious.  I was highly disappointed.  This 'beverage' tastes like stale water, which I suppose it is... I tried mixing in some juice and it did not help - it just made it into a different flavor of putrid. Perhaps, the answer is a sweetened version with some pulp in it - I will give it one more try :)"
1,"I bought this coffee in the hopes that it would taste like GMCR's Island Coconut and I was sorely disappointed.  The ""island essence"" it purports to have tasted somewhat like rum extract and the coconut flavor lacked depth."
1,"There is nothing metallic about this color. It is gold in the fact that it is yellow, but that is it. There isn't any sheen or sparkle. I was bummed."
1,"Chocolate Juniors appear to be an average tastykake comprised of cake and chocolate icing. Beware. They aren't as pleasing to your mouth as they are to your eyes (not that theres anything special with presentation of this snack). The sheer smell of the snack will make you question taking the first bite. The reason you choose these over krumpets was probably because they were half off (they're always half off)or they simply ran out of what you wanted. When I was the victim of this snack, I was hungry it was late and I had no alternatives.<br /><br />As you munch into the unholiness of the awful sponge of a once preservative soaked cake your eyes may glisten with regret, sorrow, and dismay. Yes you paid for this. The aftertaste is fortunately easier to deal with than blocking the memory of this horrid cake in the future. Please beware of purchasing this snack. It was one of the most unpleasant encounters with food if had in a while.<br /><br />The next day I shared the snack with some friends and even they too agreed on the terrible taste, and those cakes were from a box purchased in a separate store. The cake I ate was actually fresh and from a nearby factory from where it was purchased. Tastykake has no excuse to sell this product to people. Do they hate us?"
1,"I just got the Honeydew powder I ordered. It was shipped very quickly which was great. I am a bit confused though. When reading through the listing it said to mix the product with 1 scoop sugar or simple syrup, 1 scoop powdered creamer and 1 scoop of honeydew powder. This made sense till I read the ingredient label on the product. It lists sugar and non dairy creamer as the first ingredients. I was under the impression that the order was for flavored powder and that I would be adding my own sweetener and creamer powder. I am diabetic so I am unable to use this with sugar in it. Both the product description and the directions for preparation are extremely sketchy. If I were to take the product I was sent and prepare it with the directions I was given it would be nothing but sugar and creamer. I paid well over $40 with the high shipping cost for a 2.3 lb. bag of sugar and creamer that I could have purchased at the grocery store for about $3. That is robbery."
1,"Buyer beware.  Read  COMPLETELY  when and what you are getting and how much it is.  Very confusing and Amazon does not help when the hassle arrives.  The Flying Noodle can't be trusted either for their 100% satisfaction guarantee.  Don't expect much when the cheese does not arrive.  Even if they send you a notice it has shipped they find a reason to look good to Amazon in their correspondence.  Can't tell you how the cheese tastes because it never came!"
1,"ogs would not touch this dog food.. They will only eat Ceasers.. I guess it was just a cheap food.."
1,"As some of the other reviewers have noted, Baby's Only Organic Formula contains high levels of arsenic. I would love to have exclusively breastfed, but, due to a low milk supply that couldn't meet my baby's needs, I have to supplement with formula. I did a ton of research before buying Baby's Only and thought I was giving my baby the next best thing to breastmilk. I didn't want to buy Earth's Best because it contains hexane. Baby's Only was the only organic formula I could find without hexane. So I was appalled when I learned that Baby's Only dairy formula tested for high levels of arsenic (read the story on the Boston Globe's website: ""Arsenic hidden in baby formula, cereal bars, and energy shots?"") due to the brown rice syrup in it. Baby's Only hasn't issued a recall, voluntary or otherwise. I cannot believe this formula is still being sold. DO NOT BUY BABY'S ONLY. I ended up ordering another organic formula called Holle from a website in Germany. It's not available in the US, but the international shipping cost was worth it for my baby's health."
1,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Seriously, all of the reviewers are right about the MOLD and disgusting brown stuff that collects on this machine. It is a horrible feeling to realize that you have probably been feeding your child tainted food for 2 months even though you have cleaned and cleaned the product. This grows MOLD, no doubt about it. I thought I was doing a good thing for my baby and i was basically feeding him food full of mold and bacteria. What a terrible experience -- never again buying from this company."
1,"I do not understand why there is no ounce size on this product. Why does it just list medium size jar or large ...Is it a secret on the ounce size? I have not ordered this product so my opinion on the product is of no value."
1,"The Amazon.com page for this items states ""Item count says 100 and a shipping weight says 6 pounds"".  The picture shows a box of pig ears. I ordered and recieved ""1"" pig ear with shipping cost almost $7.00.  Complete rip off!  This is false advertising at its worse and now they want to charge me shipping to return my $7.00 pig ear.  I will be filing a complaint with BBB to protect others on Amazon.com from being ripped off like this."
1,"I get annoyed when sellers are too lazy to put the information buyers need within the listing. This is a great product, and my cats love it, but I won't be buying it unless I know what I am getting."
1,"My wife and I love these soups but what the heck happened to the prices?  I went back to a purchase of this same soup from 2009 and we paid about $23 for a 6 pack...now $44???<br />Gimme a break...will keep looking...purchasing in a local store would be cheaper...what is going on, Amazon???!!!!"
1,"I purchased these kcups to use with my Cuisinart Keurig maker.  While the product tastes good, it repeatedly causes brewing problems with the cuisinart, either stopping its function completely or causing it to overflow.  Would not recommend for use with Cuisinart makers."
1,"This coffee tastes and smells repulsive. I like the flavor of Kahlua and I love coffe. I love the international creamers Kahlua creamer. I thought this would be an obvious win. I brewed a cup and the smell was HORRENDOUS! I drank a couple of sips and almost threw up! It doesn't taste like Kahlua or coffee! DO NOT BUY THIS! YOU ARE WARNED! IT IS BAD!!!!"
1,"I got a box of the Cafe Escapes Hot Chocolate with my Keurig last Christmas. I had no idea the machine made anything but coffee, so it was a welcome surprise. My girlfriend doesn't drink coffee but she loves hot cocoa, so I thought she would be tickled to have a cup of cocoa in three minutes flat.<br />I brewed her a cup after running the Keurig through the rinse cycle and made her a cup of cocoa in a small mug on the second-to-lowest size setting (we have a B-79). Immediately she grimaced at the taste and objected to drinking another sip. She told me it tasted weak, tasted like it contained a fake sugar-substitute and had a horrible after-taste. Reluctantly I dumped it, just thinking she was being picky, as she sometimes is.<br />A few days later I was still warming-up on a cold morning and didn't want another cup of coffee, so I figured I had 15 cocoa K-Cups left, so why not try one?<br />Not only was her description completely accurate, but she left out the fact it was so bad it would ruin the rest of my morning. It was dreadful in every aspect and although I really hate to waste anything, I had to dump it too. It was completely undrinkable and I'm typing this with the worst taste fermenting in my mouth. Ugh, my tongue is coated with artificial, filmy gross-ness and I have a feeling drinking the melted wax from a chocolate-scented dollar-store candle would've tasted better. This is absolutely the worst hot chocolate mix I've ever had the displeasure to attempt to drink. I have 14 cups left and I just might toss them all. I wouldn't give this to a prisoner. Awful. I wish there were ""negative stars""."
1,"I actually love this product. Because I can't have sugar, I have to seek out products like Barbara's sugar free/fruit only fig/blueberry bars.<br /><br />The only problem is that the expiration date on this product was Jan 9 2008, and this product was sent to me in March 2008.  When I asked for another batch with a later expiration date, I was sent another 6 boxes<br />in April with the same Jan 9 2008 date.<br /><br />Get with it Amazon, that's not okay..... The product gets noticably goey<br />and is not a firm cookie past the expiration date.  I really wanted this<br />product, but had to ask for my money back due to this expiration date problem.  Amazon gave me a $10 coupon for other Amazon products,<br />but no cookies. Oh well, I guess I'll loose a few pounds...."
1,"I ordered the cat food online because of the savings and convenience but will not order again because there were 3 damaged cans. It ended up being more expensive than buying in the store."
1,"The product arrived and it is not as pictured or described.  The Smarties logos visible on the box and the individual necklace packages that are seen in the product picture ARE NOT on the box or packages that I received.  It looks identical except for the absence of the Smarties logo.  The product itself, needless to say, is not made out of Smarties.  A case of bait and switch?  Thank you Amazon for refunding my money!"
1,"We have ordered these in the past and they were great. You could eat these for a high protein snack and not even gain weight.  These do not taste the same as before, I do not know if they have changed something - but these are disappointing to say the least.  I don't know if we will take a chance and order them again and hope this was just a fluke or not."
1,"I love Arnold Plamer's and Starbucks has the best black tea & lemonade.  I was hooked on them all summer.  When I saw a bottled version of this beverage I was so excited.  Unfortunately this is not a tasty product at all.  I drank 1/2 bottle and had to dispose of the rest of it.  Not good at all.  Very disappointed!"
1,"Just call me a sucker!!!  Ordered a bunch of steaks, burgers, hot dogs, potatoes, and fish from Omaha Steaks.  Poorest meat I have ever eaten.  We can get better quality at Walmart and even better yet at the local butcher shop.  Then we are bombarded with phone sales calls and junk mail.  Wished I would never have fallen for ""Best Steaks you have ever eaten"".  Will never purchase again."
1,"I really like the flavor, health factor, and value of this organic cereal.  But it contains these incredibly hard bits that do not soften in milk and hurt my teeth and gums like no other food I have ever eaten before.  I actually had two of my molars spread apart by this cereal, which take a long time to heal, with weeks and months of rest between another atempt to eat this cereal, it happend again every time.  And the raisins are also very hard and chewy, which tires out your jaw and makes you wonder to yourself if you are ever going to finish this cereal before lunchtime."
1,"First, I LOVE the sodastream machines. They work great for sparkly water anytime you need it.<br />The syrups taste good--just like store bought sodas. But, the price for the syrup is insane! Each bottle makes the equilalent of 6 2L bottles of soda. Every supermarket I go to has 2L bottles of soda for $1 regularly--so the store bought equilent is only $6."
1,"This is very runny. I used it in my coffee and it doesn't add the creaminess that Thai Kitchen's coconut milk did. It also doesn't have that coconut milk flavor. It just tastes bland. I'm quite disappointed. Now I have 11 cans I have to figure out how to use.<br /><br />I wanted to update. The can has a money-back guarantee printed on the label. I emailed them and they sent me a refund. While I'm still unhappy with the product, the customer service was fantastic."
1,"We first went from 4 boxes to 3....now we went from 8+ dollars to > 14 dollars. I will NOT pay this. Walmart and Food Lion are much much cheeper now. I will cancel this subscription today. Makes NO since."
1,"I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  ""Crunchies"" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  ""Crunchies"" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is ""pineapple,"" so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.  If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend ""Funky Monkey"" or ""Crunchy N Yummy"" which are both sold by Amazon."
1,"It is that taste... the taste of what a smelly foot  smells like with the twang of nachos... but bad nachos. Look I commend people for trying to say it's spicy but it really isn't. It's also not a taste that a normal person should be eating. Look if you lack tastebuds this popcorn is for you. However if  you want cheesey goodness on your popcorn... heat up actual cheese and pour it over your popcorn."
1,"The chocolate bunny I received was about a hundred years old -- it is completely white and chalky and cracked down the center where the two halves meet.  I cannot use this for the Easter Basket I am putting together for my neice. A comoplete waste of money."
1,"I have loved Emeril's coffee for years. I ordered 4 boxes which arrived a few days ago. The k-cups taste insipid,  with no aroma or flavor---just plain lousy.<br />Since Amazon does not accept returns on foods I am stuck with 4 boxes of virtually undrinkable coffee. The box number is 1047. On the k-cup is 05:57PL26L4<br />Hope you have not ordered it."
1,"There is hardly any of the herbs advertised on the box in the actual tea leaves.<br />Jason Winters wrote a book about how this ""Miraculous"" discovery saved him from TERMINAL CANCER.<br /><br />Too bad this same ""Miraculous"" tea didn't help my sister one iota.<br />Sadly we bought this tea out of desperation. It tastes like nothing, really.....and it does NOTHING.<br /><br />What a shame."
1,"Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!"
1,"I was not satisfied with this purchase.  The advertisement was for a bulk container and the licorice came in 5 plastic bags.  2 of the bags were torn open as a result of the shipping process.  The licorice itself is an excellent product but the item identified was not as ordered.<br /><br />I will not purchase this item here again."
1,"this stuff has congealed and has black crystals or something in the bottom of the bottle and I want my money back."
1,"I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs.  One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys.  I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided.  On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them.  In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls.  By three hours there were no treats left in either of them.  Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too.  The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room.  I wouldn't recommend this product due to the high price tag, and the fact that it just doesn't deliver on it's name."
1,"I have tried potato salad while in Germany and here in the Amish county.But this is horrible.First of all it's liquid like soup and extremely sweet !<br />If you are looking for a real German potato salad get one in a Deli or try to make it yourself.But don't buy this one it's a complete waste of money."
1,"I figured i would buy this online since it was cheaper than in the stores and my fish had about 4 days left on their food. if i waited my fish would have probably died.lol. i had to go out anyway to buy fish food because the shipping was soo slow."
1,"Keep in mind that these are the small 4.4 oz packages, not the 8.8 oz packages I've always bought in stores.  Turned out to be a lousy price when I got half as much as I expected.  Yes, it's labeled clearly.  No, it can't be returned.  Stupid me."
1,"ok. not too many ingredients from barbecue sauce , actually hardly taste the bar b' q ewy-ness at all, mainly garlic onions and tomatos with some vinegar and water. nasty shit people, nasty shit."
1,"It has a very bitter after taste and clumps up. I put it in my tea and found two lumps at the bottom of the cup when i finished. This is total garbage. If it was the first stevia i had tried I would be off stevia for good."
1,"Shipping was not the problem; the tree came nicely packaged. However, it was dead to begin with. The leaves were brown. Over the next couple of weeks, I watered the tree consistently, hoping I could revive it. The only thing that I was successfully growing in that pot was moss. The tree continued to look worse and worse. I'm positive that I didn't do anything wrong. I watered it every day, made sure it was getting plenty of sunlight, and even misted the leaves. I want either a new, LIVING tree, or my money back."
1,"I love Earl Grey tea.  I dislike this.  The bergamot is some weird essence very different from others I have had, and I do not enjoy it at all.  Kind of too fruity and flowery, and not woodsy and sophisticated.  My office mate said it smelled like whisky and Southern Comfort added to tea.  Not what I was looking for."
1,"This is the first and last time I will be ordering food from Amazon. My 4 year old is addicted to Mini Nilla Wafers. I can't seem to find them in any stores where I live so I had to resort to ordering online. The cookies were extremely soggy and stale. DO NOT order food online. It's not worth it!"
1,"What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake."
1,"In 2010 when I bought my Keurig K-cups were about $.42 each. Now they are $.60 each! My Keurig has been just taking up counter space now. And K-cups are too much plastic and foil waste for the land-fill. I want to like this product but it just doesn't make any sense. And the coffee is bitter."
1,"I'm an experienced kale chip eater, and usually love them.  And I usually like Indian food.  But I *hate* these Bombay Curry flavor kale chips.  First, I dislike the spicing.  A lot.  I also wasn't a huge fan of the kale itself: the leaves strike me as somewhat small, and there seemed to be a high proportion of spines (which are hard, and not tasty).<br /><br />On the plus side, it was organic kale.  Which is really nice.  I'd probably just look for a different flavor.  I think some of the others are cheaper too, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T7OVXW"">Rhythm Superfoods Mango Habanero Kale Chips, 2-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>, which is also available as subscribe & save.  (I've never tried that flavor, but it sure sounds good!!!)<br /><br />Or, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Y2EKNW"">Kale Krunch, Cheezy Chipotle, 2.2 Oz Organic</a>, which I find is a really good brand, and I find is the best Kale Krunch flavor."
1,"after tasting it, but looking at the ingredient list, there is almond flour in it and I am allergic...Can't Kashi make a peanut granola bar w/o other nuts in them?"
1,"I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows."
1,"I puchase regular soda because I am allergic to artificial sweeteners. Why is there artificial sweetener in a regular soda syrup?"
1,"How do you kill a good product ?<br />Well, bring Coke and they know how to take nature's pure coconut water, add a bunch of flavors, destroy the taste and package them in genuine plastic.<br /><br />Sorry, I will go for another product.."
1,"It would have been nice if aspartame had been listed in the product description.<br />Instead I am stuck with a box of cider that no one in my house can drink.<br /><br />Aspartame causes migraines in my family, as well as just not being a healthy alternative.<br /><br />Funny, now I see that the aspartame is listed in product description.  I wish it had been there when I ordered."
1,"It is unfortunate that the wording of this item description doesn't make it clear that this is artificial flavor. Real vanilla is always brown because vanilla beans are brown. The artificial vanillas are by-products of wood processing and contain petro chemicals.  Do your taste buds and body a favor - use the real stuff even though your cake/frosting will not be pure white."
1,"I too bought this cereal a couple months ago. It's a good product, perfect with a healthy dollop of yogurt. But the price is now double what I paid for it! That's more than six dollars a box for a cereal that is primarily oats. What a rip-off."
1,"I cannot recommend this product.  It tastes like lemon drop candies, not lemonade.  I guess it is an acquired taste...that I will not acquire."
1,"I bought this to help me sleep because of the tons of great reviews. I couldn't get down more than a sip. I didn't expect it to be great, but it was down right unbearable. It's impossible for me to take. Huge waste of money,"
1,"I ordered this as a Christmas present. When we opened it we found out that you need about $200 worth of equipment to make this. I am an amateur beer maker and thought this would be alot of fun. When you order extra there it says REFILL kit. That is EXACTLY what this is! A REFILL KIT!!! This advertising is extremely deceptive. It also says nothing about all the extra equipment you will need, so here are the thing you will need to buy;<br /><br />*Primary Fermentor: food grade plastic (30) little capacity.<br />*Carboy 23 liter glass or food grade plastic<br />*Racking tube and siphon hose<br />*hyrometer, thermometer, and test jar<br />*long hadled plastic Spoon<br />*Bottle Brush<br />*Bottle corker<br />*filter and filter pads From A wine retailer<br /><br />And now you are ready to go!!!"
1,"I'm used to cheap tea (by the way, cheap tea isn't low quality), but this one's awful. It tastes like very spicy water.. water with Tabasco added, essentially. Although I did steep the tea bag for about four minutes, there was no depth to the flavor. I finished the cup, but I certainly wouldn't buy it."
1,"Cutter 32 oz. Backyard Bug Control Spray Concentrate is no longer effective. I used to be able to spray my yard with this and mosquitoes would disappear for about 10-14 days.<br /><br />Something happened in the last year or so. First, the applicator is terrible. I noticed that the solution doesn't even come out most of the time, only water. I notice that I am spraying my entire yard, but the same level of bug spray is still in the bottle. I tried 3 different bottles and the same thing happened each time. I had to manually open the hole with a stick to get any solution to come out.<br /><br />Even with the hole now slightly open and the solution flowing out, the product flat out does not work. My yard is still infested with mosquitoes after spraying.<br /><br />Will not purchase this again. Now I'm stuck with $30 of spray that doesn't work b/c I don't have my receipt to return them."
1,"Disappointed big time.  The flavor lasts a very short time and if you leave the pack in the car (out of the sun and still wrapped) you will be very disappointed with the outcome.  Gum crumbles.  Main compliant though is the flavor lasts only a short time."
1,"This creamy peanut butter has lots of lumps that are not chunks of peanuts. Will not reorder this product due to unknown gooey chunks/texture ...does not spread smoothly or evenly."
1,"I thought this glitter would be gold like it's described, but it isn't. It looks more like a yellow orange to me. It's also very bitter so you can't use a lot of it. I was very disappointed!"
1,"I tried this today and it was not edible.  Way too sweet, strong soy sauce taste, just nasty.  I would not try this if I were you!"
1,"I just purchased these at the 99 cent store. I was very disappointed with the taste: super sweet, very little dark chocolate flavor, not even creamy like milk chocolate...BUT....each to his own, I guess.  me, I would rather save my calories for better tasting chocolate."
1,"Iopened the pkg and all but 25 waffle bowls survived. Iam left with an open house this weekend and not enough bowls!!!"
1,"I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews.  Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!  I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks."
1,"This kind of tea not good ....!Taste and smell so wear it's not like tea ,and feel like some thing chemical."
1,"Purchased two boxes of these coffee pods and have used 10 of the 48.  The pods do not work correctly in my Keurig.  The machine sounds and acts differently with these pods and produces one half of the normal coffee size.  When reusing the pod the second time, even less volume.  The Coffee tastes OK but something is wrong with the pods.  Never had this problem with Green Mountain Coffee pods or other brands."
1,"It taste like they put water in here.  i prefer monster espresso. it more creamy and delicious..<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QGBNEK"">4 Pack Monster X-Presso Energy - Hammer - 6.75oz.</a>"
1,"That's right parents, the unit warped on the first use and basically became a $150 paper weight.<br /><br />We contacted the company and they did happily send replacement parts but geez, you can't have a product going to the crapper after one use. Totally unacceptable.<br /><br />On the bright side, it did do a good job of making the sweet potato goo but it was nothing that boiling a sweet potato and throwing it in a real food processor can't do."
1,"This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost ""manure"" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said ""Oh, that's not bad!"" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!"
1,"Ginger, lemon and honey seem a natural flavor combination. Unfortunately, this drink ends up being entirely unappealing -- it is a dirty brown color, it smells musty, and the taste is too strong and powdery. The only real positive is that at least the dry pellets dissolve quickly and completely in hot water, so the consistency is nice and even. I could not stand to take more than a couple sips."
1,"I bought Real Lime & Real Lemon based on their claim that 1/4 tsp equals 1 Tbsp of juice. The actual package says 1/2 tsp. equals 1 Tbsp of juice. That's HALF the amount of juice as advertised. They need to change their advertising to match the actual product. Keep this in mind when you purchase - not such a bargain afterall."
1,"I drink all variety of Hawaiian coffee over 15 years and like to try something new, so this one have very bad taste and i think this mix off all junk coffee not Hawaiian and it overpriced $8.00 coffee selling for $30.00 ""good business"". This is My personal opinion maybe someone like it, or not tried other coffee."
1,"I used to get something similar to these as a kid in the early 90's so I was kinda psyched when I saw these. However, my excitement quickly abated when i tasted one....they have a gritty texture and the cookie portion tastes like...well nothing...maybe what cardboard would taste like if you ate it...and the chocolate center is not at all creamy like I remember, it's more like a chunk of chocolate chalk or something...not pleasing to eat at all...nostalgia aside, I would certainly not eat these again...maybe I got a bad box, but i can't recommend these..."
1,"Neither Amazon nor the Pacific website list the Sodium level in this product. But, based on the positive reviews, I ordered it. Now I know why they don't list it. There's almost 3g of salt in each box! More per serving than Campbells regular! Over twice as much as Campbells Healthy Request! It may be organic and gluten free, but healthy it definitely is NOT!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb Milk Chocolates Assortment<br /><br />Well...they sounded great to me! The reviews were great too! Off they went for Mothers' Day (shame on me). The ""giftee"" said they were "" the most ***awful chocolates I've ever had! I tried several...no carmels, no creams, no nothing! Just a pound of solid chocolate...don't ever give me anything else unless I ask for it!"" She needn't worry...I'm done."
1,"As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a ""Creme Caramel"" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee."
1,"In my opinion, this product adds practically no flavor to water and what little flavor it does add is unpleasant!  I feel like I have been duped by all the other positive reviews for this product.  Thanks to everybody who wrote these glowing product reviews for fooling me into wasting my money!  I would like to return it for a refund but apparently that option isn't available for this product."
1,"This is the worst coffee ever!!!! Tastes like cheap dollar store coffee!!!!  Do not waste your money!!!! We drink Senseo Coffee and had to buy this in a pinch.....not worth it!"
1,"This tea tastes old and has zero taste. I'm a pretty experienced tea drinker.  Been drinking tea all my life. Did not have any aroma. Very unhappy. Ended up throwing away half of the box. Tried to give it a fair chance.  I tried the pure Ceylon."
1,"I have no idea how it tastes.  Because it is so expensive, I do not want to open it.  Bought it for emergencies.  Each can was packed in paper, but each can was dented.  So, it is obvious that they deliberately sent me dented cans, some cans dented badly.  Do not buy!  Contents could be spoiled."
1,"Thought I was doing a good thing for my doxie mix by getting one of the better brands as listed on dogfoodanalysis but boy was I mistaken. Gradually made the change from her old food to the new and she hates it. She has thrown up twice so far. I will be taking my loss and throwing the rest out. Back to her old food. It may be great for some dogs, just didn't work for mine."
1,"The oats arrived reeking and rancid in their beautiful steel container.  A replacement order was spoiled as well.  First problem I've ever had with a food product from Amazon, but this one had halitoatsis for sure.  Caution is advised."
1,"I really wanted to like these. I just don't like burnt cheese, and that is what it tastes like.  Don't waste your money.  I should have read the reviews."
1,"No one, not even my children liked these. They were hard and very, very chewy and lacked flavor. There were only 4 in the package, not eight like we were expecting, which was fine with me because I would have just thrown them away anyways. Just a heads up if you needed eight for something. The only positive was that they looked cute."
1,"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one."
1,"My dog loves these, but the bag arrived with a large slice across it. I don't love that they are made in China but this is the only rawhide she will eat."
1,"I guess I was expecting a more authentic beef jerky but the texture and flavor of this is terrible. It reminds me of the ""parts is parts"" commercial that used to run on TV about all the bad pieces being pressed together to make a totally unpalatable piece of food. I was very disappointed in this and will never purchase it again."
1,"I love my SodaStream seltzer maker.  I purchased the syrup mixes to give my drinks a little flavor.  I was very disappointed with the ingredient list: artificial flavors, sodium benzoate, acesulfame potassium, and Red #40 and Yellow #6.<br /><br />I drink seltzer instead of soda because I want to avoid these artificial ingredients.  These syrup mixes were not worth the money."
1,"Those have to be the three most boring cups of coffee I've ever had. The first cup tasted like watered down creamer and sugar. Thinking maybe I'd done something wrong, I tried again with the same result. Next time around I used two pods, no cream, and no sugar hoping for a stronger cup. No dice. I really like the idea of the coffee, the organic certification, fair trade certification, charities and initiatives they support, but come on, make me a stronger and more flavorful cup! Brown water isn't going to cut it."
1,"We brewed 2 cups of the Vermont Country Blend and found very weak.  We brewed about 5 cups of the Tullys House Blend and did not care for the taste.  I should have gotten all San Francisco Bay coffee's. We purchased French Roast and one other flavor and my whole family loves this coffee."
1,"I'm all for eco-friendlier packaging, but this coffee goes bad the minute you open the package. Even the first pod out is a bit stale, and anyhow the flavor is terrible to begin with. Yuck!"
1,"I would not recommend these to ANY dog owner.  First, they are package very poorly.  Most bones are wrapped in plastic with no air inside, these come in loose plastic and therefore lose the freshness that you expect them to have.  They don't smell like regular dog bones..they smell OLD and just gross.  I bought the knee bones as well as the regular dog bones from smokehouse.  Both were gross.  Splintered very easily and were way too brittle for a dog to chew on. Sometimes cheap things---are really just CHEAP."
1,"I ordered A case of dog food and these 4 boxes of cereal. I joined Amazon prime. 2 day free shipping. Awful packaging. Items got to me quickly that is about it. The cereal was wrapped in some kind of wrap and was crushed thanks to the Joes that packaged it. A simpleton knows that you don't put cereal in the same box as a case of dog food. Half of the boxes are mostly crumbs. Shop elsewhere for cereal"
1,"I thought I would give this a try since I generally love spicy things.  Thought it would be good on some homemade tacos, wraps, etc.  Boy was I wrong.  It wasn't spicy at all to me, honestly it didn't even taste jalapeno to me.  It was more like a peppery, yet sour taste to me.  I had to spit it out, no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't swallow it.  Yuck!"
1,"I love iced coffee!  I can drink it morning noon and night, however, this missed the mark.  It was bitter and not what I had hoped for.  I will continue to purchase other illy products, but this one will stay of my list.  Great if you like bitter, not so great if you are looking for a smooth bold taste."
1,"I use Natural Goodness lots, so I thought this subscription would save some trips to the store.  What I got instead was an hour cleaning carpeting and tile floor.  Never such a mess.  I'll only buy cans for shipping from now on!!"
1,"Only after I purchased this and opened it did I see 'Product of China'. They do not have to adhere to American food safety standards in China. BUY SOMETHING ELSE.<br /><br />I would rate this no stars but Amazon won't allow that."
1,"This has been my least favorite coffee purchase so far for the Keurig. My husband came into the kitchen and thought I had been conducting a science experiment as it smelled like chemicals. The flavor is also a combination of plastic and chemicals. I would have been happy if it even had a cafe mocha flavor like other reviewers have called it, but I don't even begin to get that. Very disappointed."
1,"I bought these imported sweet potato chips because they are less than half the price of SAM'S YAMS which are my dog's favorite treats. The first bag seemed fine, but the stored bags all developed what appears to be a silvery white mold, although the expiration date is December, 2013. I have no idea if this could be dangerous to dogs, but I tossed mine out, because we have had terrible problems with food poisoning of our pets from imported ingredients.<br /><br />If anyone else has had this experience I would like to know if the white stuff is natural or is, in fact, dangerous. Thanks!"
1,"These pellets are the EXACT same as ""equine (horse) bedding"", and similar to wood pellets for pellet stoves. You can buy a 40  (yes, forty!) pound bag of equine pellet bedding for only $6!!! (vs $10 for 20 pounds of Feline Pine!) I purchase at my local farm/tractor store. Wood stove pellets are even less - can get 40 pounds as cheap as $4.  I called the manufacture of one wood pellet stove product and they told me it is totally safe for pets...no chemicals used in production, and made from PINE, etc. However, some wood pellet stove are made from hardwoods (not pine) and this would not be as absorbent so you need to double check on the type of wood stove pellets. I'd stick with equine bedding...it is pine and made for animals.<br /><br />I do love this type of litter! No dust. Absorbs and masks odor better than any other litter. After using this type of litter for a couple years, I am pretty ""skilled"" at being able to scoop out mostly only the sawdust, and leave the intact pellets behind. My cats usually pee in the corners so that is where most of the sawdust is. Also, if you shake the box, sawdust drops to bottom and you can scrape intact pellets to the side and scoop the sawdust underneath out. If you don't pay attention when you scoop and are not tedious with a ""method"" like me, you will likely also scoop out a lot of the intact pellets too and thus waste a lot of it. We went out of town for 2 weeks, and our cat sitter used DOUBLE the amount of litter we use!<br /><br />For the star rating - I'd actually give 5 stars for this pine pellet type of litter. But I am giving one star because of the ridiculous price charged by Feline Pine!!"
1,"In 2010 when I bought my Keurig K-cups were about $.42 each. Now they are $.60 each! My Keurig has been just taking up counter space now. And K-cups are too much plastic and foil waste for the land-fill. I want to like this product but it just doesn't make any sense. And the coffee is bitter."
1,"My 2 dogs and the little dog upstairs (that I gave one of these treats to) became violently ill a few hours after eating these treats. I called the manufacture who was very nice, and assured me that these (and all their treats) are closely monitored, and nothing had been reported to date. I told her I was taking my dogs to the vet, and she ask me to call her back with my vet's name and his diagnosis so that she can contact one of their vets to compare notes.<br />Since speaking with this company, I have talked with a couple of friends who have also given their dogs these same treats, and also had very sick dogs.<br />I have given my dogs the Waggin Train chicken jerky treats, and have not had any issues what so ever."
1,"I am a low carb dieter and was worried this bread was ""to good to be true"" when I ordered it.  The bread came out very bitter and I could not finish the loaf.  I must admit I am not much of a cook or have much experience with baking so there is a chance the bad bread was a screw up on my part."
1,"I bought the mum-mums for two reasons: to provide teething itch relief for my 6-month-old son and to keep him independently occupied with something to munch on. The mum-mums disappointed on both of these counts. They are way too fragile and crumble easily. I thought they would be hard so that he could suck on them for a while, but as soon as I put one in his mouth he ""bit"" off a huge piece that obviously would have presented a choking hazard. And he can't even hold them - they crumble in his grasp. (This is also the reason they are not so good on the go - they crumble to pieces in the bag.) So, I end up breaking off little pieces and putting them in his mouth. I could use Cheerios for that instead of spending that much money on the mum-mums!<br />Taste-wise they are pretty good and he enjoys them, plus they are organic and I know they are easy on his stomach. But they are a disappointment because they failed on both intended purposes: they do not provide teething relief and they do no work as a snack for him to enjoy on his own."
1,"I ordered this item well before Xmas as a gift for a secret santa gift. They told me it wouldnt be shipped till the 26 but would arrive before Jan, 1st. This was after Amazon said if items ordered will get to their destination before Xmas. First LIE. Then on Dec 30, I receive a email saying they are out of stock and would NOT be able to ship this item at all. One day before it was to arrive. This leaves me without a gift and no possibility for replacement in time. This is just too much sloppy handling of accounts. I am VERY UNHAPPY and you should be very very careful with this company. It is from TAYLOR'S MARKET and should be passed up."
1,"I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a ""Low glycemic"" food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption."
1,"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!"
1,"someone gave me the jar of PB2.  I thought it was awful...yuck.  thank goodness I didn't actually pay money for it.  It was nasty!!"
1,"The coffee is a standard supermarket item.  The shipper, some operation called Lasership, failed to deliver it to me even though I was home the day the shipment allegedly was dropped off or dumped, perhaps in front of the building in Manhattan.  Other Amazon shipments to tenants in the large apartment building I live in can now be found in the front of the building or its unattended lobby, totally abandoned.<br /><br />Terrible, awfully irresponsible actions by Amazon, considering others have already complained, online, about this problem.  I don't need the free ""two-day"" delivery; was happy with standard ground-UPS service, where the UPS driver finds the recipient, often merely by ringing the tenant's bell, or hands the packages over to the superintendent of the building, who signs for them, and is located in the basement.  But Amazon doesn't offer a choice.  Not worth the trouble to save a few dollars.  Amazon made good on the failure to deliver."
1,"This is the nastiest tasting drink ever! It even made my tongue tingle after two sips; God only knows what I drank. Don't waste your money."
1,"This smells more like cat food. My dogs ate the first can, but I mixed half with their previous food.  Now they won't touch it, even by itself."
1,"Returned the product. It was old, stale, hard and not edible for my dogs to even (bite thru) to eat.<br />Theres other companies with fresher bags.<br />However, this compnay was Extremely helpful and kind about my returning the bags to them."
1,"I thought this shampoo might be answering the call for a mild shampoo with vitmins for the masses, but it's just a LIE.  A shampoo is suppose to mildly clean the hair and this one contains harsh detergents (SLS).  I don't even use SLS on my hands.  It's also heavily loaded with silcones, which laminates hair and weighs it down, so you need a shampoo to get it out.  You might want one conditioner or straightening product with cones, but not your shampoo.  Also, it contains other ingredients that causes allergic reactions, and does nothing for hair, (Bismuth Oxychloride).  Why would you want to stick Bismuth in a shampoo?  In short, steer clear of these products."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IMO"">Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>I have been eating this cereal every morning for many years. My last shipment was different in several ways.  The flakes were thicker, tough and stuck in my teeth, and there was a gritty feel which gave me kind of a sore tongue.  I contacted the cereal company online and they promised to make it right.  Said the cereal had not changed its formula but during the period in question, there was a glitch and the flakes were rolled thinner.  Didn't seem that to me, just the opposite, plus the taste was altered for the worse.  They have sent me coupons to buy Nature's Path products, but no one around my small town carries it.  I will use them, however, when I get to a larger city, 50 miles away.  I then ordered the same cereal ""with raisins"" described as plump and juicy raisins, from a different on-line distributor.  It's the same, except the raisins are like little hard rocks. We ground the first shipment up for the birds, but they won't eat it either."
1,"I posted Lindt a letter at their site and then saw that all these reviews voice my sentiments exactly.  The new bar is pitiful.  Bring back the perfect chocolate bar."
1,"I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called ""cat"" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their ""flavors"" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is ""good"" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold."
1,"my coworker bragged this soup up...she brought in the tomato bisque...first of all, she made it in the container...it specifically says to heat on the stove or microwave in a seperate container...oh well, I decide to try anyway since she wanted to share w/ me...flavor is well....salty first, a little heat, VERY creamy...some oily seperation around the edges and it stained my lips, tongue and inside of my mouth...it just doesn't 'feel' like your eating healthy...blehhhh....not too mention the last ingredient is autolyzed yeast extract...hidden MSG!!! shame shame Campbells!!! I will never try this again...yuck...I have always preferred my healthy and very flavorful homemade soups!!!"
1,"There seems to be a lot of starch added (per the ingredient list) which results in a product that tastes gummy. The flavor and texture is pasty. It was an expensive mistake, relative to the cost of regular pasta. I won't be ordering again."
1,"This concentrate tasted nothing like chai tea should. I prepared exactly according to the instructions on the box, but even so all I could taste in the tea was a strong, pepper-ish overtone that completely blocked any hints of the other spices. It was undrinkable. After several attempts at brewing it differently, I ended up throwing it out."
1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1,"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon."
1,"I didn't like this coffee at all.  I like strong, full-flavored coffee and this is not it.  There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak.  So far the only K-cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the brand), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.<br /><br />I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other."
1,"I had read about this product in several magazines and was anxious to try it - but after the smell and the first bite, I had to toss it.  The smell when you first open the package is nasty but goes away after much rinsing and parboiling.  The ultimate gross out though was the texture - just not what I am expecting from a pasta."
1,"I bought this with high hopes of being able to grow a plant for my younger cousin. I am a gardner myself so I was pretty excited. However the plant NEVER grew no matter what I did. To me it was a waste of money time and resources. DO NOT BUY. Get a plant from a florist or even from Home Depot- it'll be better than this piece of crap."
1,"This made our cat really sick, maybe we bought a spoiled batch, but we tried twice and both times his reaction was to puke soon afterward. Caused vomiting and diarrhea. Unfortunately we purchased multiple bags, which will just end up in the trash."
1,"Don't bother buying a Senseo coffee maker. The coffee is delicious and a cup is brewed very quickly, IF YOU CAN BUY THE COFFEE PODS. No other brand tastes as good. Senseo has mismanaged their conversion to online only selling (check out the Senseo FaceBook page) and promised to have pods available by mid June. It is June 26 and there isn't a pod to be found anywhere. Good-bye Senseo, hello Keurig."
1,"I've just spent an hour and half trying to get rid of the maggots from my compost cart because of this lousy product.  I have been using them for several years but not anymore.  The last case I bought has the strength of wet tissue and is impossible to handle without tearing.  Even though I only filled them half full, very carefully tied them, I could not get them into the cart without tearing.  I used to love this product but not anymore.  I am now looking for another bag to try.  Buy Biobags only if you want to study the life cycle of the fly up close!"
1,"I purchased this tea because I was told that it helps with excess gas but this tea has made worsen my gas problem. I am very disappointed with the purchase"
1,"These dog treats are made in china and are potentially poisonous. They should be avoided at all costs.  My dog is too precious to me to even take the risk.  Chinese people EAT dogs, they don't care about yours.  I urge all consumers to send emails to Milos Kitchen AND Waggin Train and let them know these products are NOT ACCEPTABLE to Americans.  There's no reason why hard-working Americans can't make tasty dog treats, and we would make them with love instead of poison.  I WOULD pay a little more if these treats were American.  Rachael Ray has a terrific line of dog treats, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Y7TRJ2"">Rachael Ray Dog Treats Nutrish Soup Bones Long Lasting Chews - Real Chicken and Veggies Flavor</a> which are made in USA and my lil Daisy LOVES them!"
1,"My two schnauzers absolutely love the apple/chicken Chews from<br />Veggie Life Vitality.  I was having a difficult time obtaining them<br />from our pet store so I ordered them from Amazon.  No after ordering<br />12 packages and trying to return them because they are defective<br />I am told they are non refundable.  Very unhappy.  $50 in to the<br />trash.  Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet potato/chicken and  and Apple Chicken chews."
1,"I read that chicken jerky from China is dangerous for dogs so I was looking for another treat they would eat.  This was not one of them.  It didn't matter how hungry they got, they wouldn't eat these.  They sat on the floor two days.  I picked them up, threw them away and then tried again a few days later with fresh treats.  I left them in their treat spots.  They sat there for days.  They would not eat them.  It doesn't help if they were made in America but my dogs find them unpalatable."
1,"I've had coconut water and this is just plain nasty! Plus it's mixed with other fruits and instead of tasting good it taste horrible. I know the name and label are appealing. I don't recommend this product to anyone not even my mother-in-law."
1,"I did my research before deciding to spend $30+ on a bottle of vanilla, granted a very large one. After reading all the comments, I expected the pleasant aroma of vanilla wafting from the bottle upon opening, but what I got instead was this murky, smokey smell that doesn't even remotely resemble vanilla. There is absolutely no vanilla aroma when I added it to my custards, even with additional amount. Sure, the vanilla specks are there, but what good would they do if they give nothing to the flavor of the dish? I must have gotten a bad bottle or something (is that even possible, for vanilla bean paste to go bad?). I'm quite disappointed, looks like I'll just have to stick with Costco vanilla extract from now on."
1,"I only drink strong, bold coffee and this was strong but there was something slightly off about it.  Another reviewer said it had an almost bitter, fishy taste to it and that's the best description I could come up with also.  I expect some bitterness because of the type of coffee I like but the fishy, past it's prime taste was unexpected.  It wasn't the coffee maker because my daughter chose another flavor and it was spot on.  As I said in another review for this coffee...the sell by date was 15 more days out so maybe it was past its prime."
1,"Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee."
1,"I don't like this product not sweet just like air in you mouth. I would not recommend or buy this product again. This was the biggest waist of money"
1,"I am very sorry to say this tasted to me the way I imagine ""rear end"" would taste. I tried refrigerating them to make it more palatable. For some reason there was a very strong bran-like taste as the most dominant flavor, with sweet and chocolate as the secondary and tertiary flavors in that order. I assume it was from the brown rice. I agree with another reviewer that they are very sweet, though since I cooked them in mini cupcake form it was not a significant problem for me. I tried for several weeks (including refrigerating and freezing) to try and finish them without wasting them, but I finally gave up. I was so worried I gave away my other untried products (carrot cake mix etc.) from this company. I didn't dare try the rest, as brown rice was listed as a primary ingredient again."
1,"It's strange but these bottles are much flimsier than than the larger 2 oz bottles of the same product. You can't really  dispense just one or two drops with one of these. The slightest pressure streams way too much sweetener."
1,"This item came well packaged, and arrived in a timely manner after I ordered it, so I do appreciate that fact.<br /><br />However, it was way too salty for me.  It was also quite overpoweringly 'fishy' - duh! - but I had thought that perhaps the spices and smoking would provide a less fishy taste, while adding some additional good taste to the salmon.  I did not taste the spices or smoking at all, just fish and salt.<br /><br />Not to my taste, I'm afraid."
1,"The Pikes Place Coffee at the Starbucks store is my favorite coffee. Decided to buy Pikes Place k cups.<br />The  taste is completely different, similar to Newman's Own Extra Bold.  I will not buy Pikes Place k cups again."
1,"This arrived with 11 of the 24 cans dented (must have been the manufacturer because it was adequately packaged for shipping and no dents/tears in outer box holding cans). One can even opened up and coated the other cans. What a mess!!!"
1,"I feed my dog Royal Canine brand which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat - I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.  Upon opening I could tell I made a mistake - smells like cardboard - my dog won't eat it no matter how I dress it up, much less could I get her to eat it plain.  Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce."
1,"Ok, I've had this a few times on burgers, wraps, etc., and come to a final conclusion that it's barf. It has no spicy flavor at all, just a weird, off-putting flavor type. I thought this would be like the most excellent gordita sauce that comes in the Old El Paso gordita kit - but it's not.<br /><br />It's weakly flavored, and basically a way to translate fat onto your food. It's not bold or spicy whatsoever. I will give it the ""creamy"" moniker, however."
1,"I am so glad they didn't send me the right amount.  There is no maple flavor at all.  Just a sugar coated stale cashew!.  The description says it's a 4 pack but they only sent 2.  I called and they asked if I wanted them to send me the other 2 packages or get a refund.  Well, they tasted terrible so I opted for the refund.  Being I got half of the product, I only got half my money back.  Please don't waste you money on these yucky nuts."
1,"I enjoy GF products, make many from Bob's Red Mill and am used to the taste. I read the reviews, many of which were very positive, and decided to try these crackers despite the high price.<br /><br />The taste, texture and smell of the crackers is very unappealing and the price is absurd.<br /><br />I do not recommend these crackers."
1,"I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired."
1,"This contains sucralose, a known and widely used poison.  I can't believe the other reviews that mention giving this to kids.  Stay away and buy soda with natural sweeteners like Stevia."
1,"First, this is a poor-tasting kombucha.  Worse, ""Wonder Drink"" Pasteurizes all of their products, eliminating any live cultures and therefore much of the reason to drink kombucha in the first place.  I do not recommend this product, and hope that Amazon carries a real kombucha in the future."
1,"Been buying Dark Magic for 4 years- it's my favorite.  Was this supposed to be the price for a 2 Pack?  Never paid more than 50 cents a buzz before."
1,"Our Great Pyrenees has to take antibiotics for three weeks and figured out the cheese trick after a few tries.  So I bought these, and he chewed the greenie and spit the pill out.  His mother will down almost any food without swallowing, but my dog insists on chewing, therefore, he finds the pill.  Waste of money.<br /><br />If your dog is a ""chewer"", I'd think twice."
1,"This was supposed to contain 50 Tully's Breakfast Blend K-Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers.  Instead there were only 38 K-Cups, 4 of which were Green Mountain Half-Caff and one of the Tully's K-Cups was busted open.  I've ordered K-Cups through Amazon many times in the past with no issue.  This is by far the absolute worst experience I've ever had with them and makes me question whether or not I'll purchase any more from them."
1,"I ordered these cookies recently. When they got to my home every single cookie was crumbled in a million pieces. And they tasted awful. The worst cookie ever!! :("
1,"I don't have much of a review for this product. I received it through the Vine Program and I did not like it at all. If the stench from this tea wasn't enough to stop me from drinking it, the taste was. I've had detox teas that have tasted better than this. I don't know if it was the over powering of the ginger or another ingredient, but this is something I'd never try again. Sorry."
1,"I had high hopes for this product. I love chocolate milk, and I use stevia to replace sugar whenever I can. Unfortunately, this stuff was just gross. I even tried it a second time hoping that I would like it better, but it was still too gross to drink."
1,"For some reason this brand, various varieties comes under a gluten free search. None of these products from this company are gluten free."
1,"At $15 for 5 pounds these lentils cost $3 a pound.  My wife was very unhappy with me as she can get them for a dollar a pound at the store.  I told her - these are super lentils and she said they better be for the price.  Kidding aside - don't buy these, buy your lentils at the store!"
1,"The following is just my opinion so take it for what it's worth.  I suppose some reviewers actually liked this, but I have to say without any doubt whatsoever, this is absolutely the WORST jerky I've ever tried.  I've grown up on the stuff, and I like a real cowboy beef jerky.  This stuff is soft, kind of falls apart in your mouth, and I'm sorry just plain TERRIBLE.  If you like a good jerky that you can chew on a while, this isn't it."
1,"I bought this particular canned Pedigree dog food from Petco for my dog, a spayed female corgi. Before trying Pedigree, we were feeding her Science Diet dry food. I bought a 12 pack of the ones with beef and ones with country stew. It was cheap (&lt;$1/can).<br /><br />Within a few days of feeding her the wet food mixed with some Science Diet dry food, her vagina started smelling strongly like fish. A few more days went by and thick bits of mucous were appearing on the fur around her vagina. One time I saw her pooping and at the same time saw a thick rope of mucous drop from her vagina. A few more days later, her fur around the vagina was tinged pink and later became red. It was evident to us there was mucous and some blood coming out of her vagina. So we stopped feeding Pedigree and went back to just the dry Science diet food. In a few days her excessive vaginal mucous and blood stopped. She is back to normal now.<br /><br />All in all we only fed her 5 cans of Pedigree dog food. For those 5 cans to cause this much problems is astounding. I would not recommend Pedigree to anyone after what happened to my dog."
1,"Both of my cats vomit from all Temptations treats, but especially the Hairball variety. One of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didn't before. I've tried all of them, and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit. This doesn't happen with any other treats like Whisker Lickins or Pounce."
1,"This bottle reminds me of the kind of catsup that stands on its top.<br /><br />So, I take the plastic off of the top, and try to take off the inner seal, but it did not remove the way they showed it should come off, so I had to take a knife and go around the bottle opening to take it off.<br /><br />Then things really went downhill from there!!<br /><br />So, I put the top back on and shake the bottle as directed.  I opened my water bottle. It doesn't say you cannot do this, in fact on the bottle itself it does show 2 kinds of water bottles, both with their tops off.<br /><br />Then the liquid squirts out of the bottle, onto my counter, which by the way you will need Soft Scrub or some kind of cleanser to get the liquid off of your counter, because it will NOT just wash off with a sponge, because I tried that first.  It did NOT work! The stain was still there, before I used the Soft Scrub to remove the stain.  Good thing it did work, because Iam a renter, and it left a huge stain!  Why this enery drink would even leave a stain that cannot just be wiped up with wet sponge is a mystery to me, which also makes me question what could be in this drink to make it even do that? That's the big question!<br /><br />The liquid squirted out onto this dish that I keep on my counter which I use for fruit, bread, etc.  Needless to say, the liquid was on the dish, and got into the bread/plastic, so I had to throw that away too.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor.  It's terrible!  It tastes fake,artifical,leaves a weird taste in your mouth, kind of like Hawaiian Punch, but worse!  Good thing I did not use alot of it in my water bottle!  I couldn't even get through the whole bottle, in fact after only a few sips I was done wanting to even drink this drink!<br /><br />I don't know if this company makes other flavors as well, but I won't even be using this bottle, it will be thrown in the trash, where it belongs, at least to me.<br /><br />I thought this would be like Mio, but no, not in any way!!<br /><br />I rarely say the word ""hate"" period.<br /><br />I have been a member of the Vine Program for several years, and in that time I don't think I have ever said that word as a Vine member, nor in any review that I have given on Amazon, and I have been a customer on Amazon's site since 1998, that is how much I hate this product!!<br /><br />I can't think of one good thing to say about this product, sadly!<br /><br />I would give it a minus one if I could!!"
1,"If you are a fan of Tassimo in general, this is not the coffee for you.  Bland, boring.  Skip it.  I miss Henry's Blend!"
1,"Ordered these because I was super excited for new flavor. HUGE disappointment! Absolutely no candy corn flavor. The price is outrageous, I thought I was ordering at least a box with four packages of cookies. Save your money, or if you really want to try them, go to Target, they are available, exclusively, there."
1,"They WILL mess your order-up; according to whimsical business practices. My yeast was 'dead as a doornail', my bulghur was good...Another customer will state their yeast was good and their bulghur was bad. They will also substitute items notoriously."
1,"It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, it's just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.  YUCK!"
1,"This is just awful! The color looks like soured milk and the taste is very watery. I will not buy this again!"
1,"I honestly don't get the popularity of this item. It is nothing more than B complex in liquid form. I guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of B vitamins. Maybe I drink too much coffee and that is why I can't appreciate the energy effects of a B complex, I think taurine and guarana are much better energy sources. Whether you prefer B vits, caffeine, taurine or guarana, below are products that will give you what this product gives you(or more) at a much more reasonable price.<br /><br />B supplements:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HQAU"">B-100 Complex 100 caps</a><br />Super Stress B Complex 100 Caps<br /><br />Liquid B supplements:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NOUDE"">Nature's Bounty B-Complex Sublingual Liquid 2 fl oz (59 ml)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125W1AO"">World Organic - Liquid B Complex, 16 fl oz liquid</a><br /><br />Caffeine, Taurine & Guarana:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTM0WK"">Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugarfree, 8.4 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O4YC"">Diet Rockstar Energy Drink-Double Strength Energy Drink 16oz, 24 Pack</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNBYXK"">Monster Lo-carb Energy 16-Ounce., 27.5 LBS Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQSQ68"">NOW Foods Taurine Pure Powder, 8-Ounce</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000703AU0"">Super Guarana 1200mg - 90 tabs,(Good N' Natural)</a><br /><br />Personally, I  think it's silly to cough up two dollars for one shot of this when you can have the same level of energy, through the same vitamins at a much cheaper price."
1,"I used to buy Manuka honey from a distribution who got it from NZ right off the ship. Manuka honey has a very specific taste and dark in color. You feel like eating something precious. This jar was tinted dark brown to resemble a dark Manuka honey in the picture, but inside the jar is a plain floral honey which is $5 in value, not a $32.68 per 2 jars as they charge. They took the expensive honey home and selling this one. I also was surprised that they put UMF 5+ (Unique Manuka Factor)-usually no such a low UMF. I felt being cheated! Do not buy this honey!"
1,"My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great ""treat"", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2-3 since, 2009!<br />Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog-go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these ""treats""!"
1,"I love real indian chai.  I have many indian friends, so I know what chai is supposed to taste like.  So delicious and comforting.<br /><br />I wanted to find a convenient chai in tea bag form so I could have it at work without too much fuss.  This is definately not it.  This has a strong smell - kind of a harsh dried orange peel smell  but doesnt have any real spice flavour.  This is a total waste and honestly  I dont understand how it got such great reviews from others.<br /><br />Money wasted."
1,"I feel bad writing a completely negative review, but there was nothing that I liked about this drink.  The liquid portion was overly sweet (and I have a powerful sweet tooth, so it takes a lot to surpass my limit of acceptable sweetness), but that might have been alright if the drink had been smooth.  The vile part of this beverage, though, is that it has chunks of pulp floating throughout it, so you have to strain it through your teeth.  When I was a teenager, I bought a couple of bottles of a soft drink called Orbitz because it looked cool - it was an overly sweet liquid with tiny gummy spheres floating throughout, and after the cool factor wore off, I never bought another bottle.  This Chantea has almost exactly the same effect on me - from the outside, it looks cool, like an ordinary trendy healthy beverage, but the experience of drinking it is almost nauseating.  I do not recommend it to anyone."
1,"My wife really loves O.N.E Coconut Water.  I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.  The first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable.  I guess a San Diego address would be undeliverable in Kentucky.  Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better, just more time consuming and heavier.  It would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy.  My wife still loves the product."

1,"After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.<br /><br />After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.<br /><br />Bottom line; the product is over-hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know it's definitely not something I will ever purchase again."
1,"I strongly suspect this caviar, which is widely available in US supermarkets is a reason for fear of caviar in 90% of American population. This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online."
1,"This tea smells so bad I cant get the smell outta my house.  I know Valerian root doesn't smell like roses but this smell is putrid.  The affects work ok but not the best"
1,"Our pug (different dog than the one in the other review) has been having trouble gagging and vomiting after having these chews, and so I tried soaking one overnight to see if it got soft after ingestion, and it wasn't soft after 12 hours. Which might explain why our small dog has been having so much trouble. No more of these chews in our house."
1,"Bahlsen Butter Cookies,4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)<br />Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing, there is NO mention of eggs and when i received the product, on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is EGG.<br />Also i emailed not send me any cookie with EGGS"
1,"Not only did I find these replusive, but so did my family members.  The fudge part is tolerable, but the chocolate has a funny taste, almost like hot chocolate powder that didn't get stirred in when you make hot chocolate.  Definitely would not buy at the store.  One cookie was more than enough."
1,"As this order of Coffee Chuppa Chups was cancelled by the supplier as they no longer had stock, I don't think I can comment on it."
1,"""Planters Dry Roasted Peanuts"" - when I first ordered they were good and crunchy and it disappeared from my house fast and so I ordered the second package and I really feel for ordering. The peanuts were old stock and did'nt taste good or cruncy. Disappointed with amazon, did not expect this from amazon.<br /><br />Since all these S&S come in three packs, it is a waste of money. Better to get one from local stores atleast if it is not good, I will not waste lot of money like I do with amazon."
1,"Tully's French Roast is my favorite morning coffee. This supply is unusually bitter.  Since I have been buying locally in smaller quantities, I feel I have been dumped upon with old product in this purchase - and will likely toss it. Advice:  buy nearer home and check ""use by"" dates.  This box comes with loose K-cups inside and no date whatsoever."
1,"MSG is the sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid and a form of glutamate. It is sold as a fine white crystal substance, similar in appearance to salt or sugar. It does not have a distinct flavor of its own, and how it adds flavor to other foods is not fully understood. Many scientists believe that MSG stimulates glutamate receptors in the tongue to augment meat-like flavors. -- FDA"
1,"Terrible, stale, awful. They were purchased to go in a gift. Had to scrap that idea after I opened one."
1,"I have brewed the coffee three times and my wife brewed it once, as well.  We tried different amounts of the pre-ground coffee and we could not brew a pot that we enjoyed.  The flavor has the overtones of chemicals, which is not to say there are chemicals in the process used, it just tasted that way.  Little body, low in complexity, and awful in flavor.  I tried one more time this morning and after tasting it once again, threw in ice, foamed milk, and poured the rest of the pot down the drain.  The unopened bag that I have and the opened bag will be disposed of.  I've read all the reviews and the touts of the manufacturer but given my druthers, I'd rather not drink coffee or suffer with the little bit of reflux I get from non-acidified coffee.  This just wasn't worth it.  I wrote to the manufacturer 2 weeks ago to say I was disappointed and asked if there is something that they recommend I do to perhaps improve the quality of the brewed coffee.  I never got a response which tells me a) they don't care and/or b) it is what it is and you will either like it or you won't. I took a chance and unfortunately it didn't work out for my wife and I."
1,"Had a couple bottles while driving around on vacation this summer.  No buzz, no energy, nothing."
1,"Don't order this product if you think you're getting two bottles.  Only one bottle arrived and I'm having a wonderful time trying to get my refund.  Fool me once, shame on you."
1,"Honestly this stuff is worse than cup o noodles, it has absolutely no flavor at all. I thought I would give this a try because my favorits is Simply Asia Brand Hot & Sour and it is a million times better. I suggest people dont waste their time on this, glad I only bought 6."
1,"I've been feeding this to my dog for months and I have just realized his stool has been pretty runny the whole time, today he had diarrhea again, probably the second or third time during that period.  I came online to see if others have been having the same problem as me, and sure enough the answer is yes.  I'm done with this dog food, I'd suggest you do the same, it's just not right."
1,"I agree with another reviewer. I have been drinking ONE coconut water for years and the individual big tetrapaks that I buy from the super market taste great. This was coconut water gone bad. The large carton of a pack of 12 tasted so awful.Like stale , musty taste.<br /><br />I even had a really bad stomach reaction by drinking these and I couldn't even figure out what happened. This item is non returnable.... Big waste of my 20 dollars. Amazon please get your stuff together..... this is really bad."
1,"Cats love this food but all 3 of mine puke up wihtin 1 hour of eating.  They have no issues with other food therefore I suspect the product is bad."
1,"I researched this as a replacement for peanut butter due to an addiction I seem to have. I did not actually purchase it on Amazon because I saw it one day in the grocery store and thought I was lucky so I grabbed it. I rarely review products but this one was soooo bad I felt the need to so no one else would waste their money like I did.<br />The first thing I noticed was the texture. I thinks it best compares to packaged low fat pudding made with skim milk. I could have gotten past the texture but the smell almost deterred me from even tasting it. It smells like what would happen if the makers of PlayDoh decided to make a peanut or peanut butter version of their PlayDoh. Very odd.<br />So now to the most important thing, the taste. Not as bad as the smell, but definitely not something I would more than just taste. It had a hint of roasted peanut but that was really it. This stuff was just weird.<br />I swallowed about 1 tsp just because I am a trooper and I wanted to give it a fair chance. But the jar went straight into the trash afterwards.<br />I have not tried any other low calorie peanut butters yet, I'm actually a little scared to now. I usually have no problem with diet foods, sweet n low, splenda etc... but this stuff is just not for me."
1,"My daughter absolutely used to love the original version of the Chick Chick baby food (with Chicken, Sweet Potatoes, and Brown Rice). Unfortunately, the recipe has apparently just been updated (though not reflected on Amazon's page as of 2/24/2012) to include totally different ingredients (except for the chicken). Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed. Hopefully your child will enjoy the new blend, but I wanted to provide a warning for those of you that may have tried the other version..."
1,"[[ASIIN:B007PA32L2 Green Mountain Coffee, Pumpkin Spice K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers, 50 count]]<br />I am so very disappointed in the lack of flavor and aroma in the new packaging of the Pumpkin spice K-cup packs.<br />The packaging is different and it says ""light roast"".  This is definately not the same coffee that I've enjoyed so much over the last 2 years. I really hope they bring back the original flavor!!! What a shame!!!"
1,"I followed the directions on the package and still had to spit the mixture out of my mouth, it had more salt than anything I've ever eaten.  I can't believe what I paid for it!"
1,"Our office purchases various Timothy's coffee products which are always excellent so we recently purchased the White Hot Chocolate. I find the taste awful and could not even drink it. It isn't sweet or chocolatly and tastes nothing like I expected it to. I would not recommend wasting your money!!!"
1,"Second item you can't trust Amazon calling ""gluten free"".  What do they think hydrolyzed corn soy WHEAT GLUTEN protein is?"
1,"I would call myself a coffee addict. I drink on average 6-10 double espresso's per day.<br />This coffee lacks everything i like and enjoy about coffee, period.<br />What a waste"
1,"I should have checked before ordering my bad. This item can be bought locally for less than $5.00 for two 48 oz. bottles. As seen in the other reviews of this product. It is being returned for a refund. Amazon fulfilled  from third party vendor."
1,"Ordered this for a party as a favor and they sent regular olive oil instead of infused. Got with cusstomer service who rushed an order again. This time they sent the same plain olive oil! Customer service was fine, but the ability to execute the proper order is definitely lacking. I'm still in the process of returning 18 bottles of olive oil to them. Frustrating."
1,"We have seven cats, one with terrible hairball problems.  The first thing we noticed is that the cats ate easily twice as much of this food as they did of the grain free we usually feed. Like human junk food this food seemed to create appetite instead of satisfying it. This food is as expensive as the grain free.  The cat with hairballs showed no improvement after two weeks of feeding this product. We have gone back to the grain free food we were feeding."
1,"It's so sad, that my favourite chocolate came to me old, hard, and just nasty. What a waste. I will never buy this online again, and I recommend you don't either."
1,"Having tried the caramel apple drink at Starbucks and liked it, I decided to try the Grove Square Sugar Free fot Cider Caramel apple cups.  What a mistake.  This is truly horrible.  I would never recommend this item even at it's low price.  There is a reason it is so cheap."
1,"I was shocked to see that these are selling for over $15 on Amazon.  My local grocery store carries this exact same product for $8.99!  The product itself gets 20 stars because my Beagles literally dance for them... but the pricing gets a big BOO!  I always shop Amazon because I know I can get terrific prices, that's why I was surprised."
1,"It tastes . . . how to put this . . . gawdawful.  There's very little fruity flavor - it actually tastes more salty than anything else.  They need a little more attention to quality control as well.  On two (make that three - no wait, four) of the twelve cartons, the spout came unglued from the container, making it difficult to open/pour and downright impossible to reseal.<br /><br />Color me singularly unimpressed.  I'm sure glad I didn't pay full price for it."
1,"Nutella is stocked by the pallet in Europe, but much less popular in the USA for the excellent reason that the NJ plant produces an inferior product. This stuff is edible, but it's too sweet and doesn't have a strong hazelnut flavor. Ferrero finished Americanizing it by putting it in a much smaller plastic container and adding trans fat. Look for the genuine imported product or try making your own chocolate peanut butter. (I've tried making a chocolate hazelnut butter, but it's hard to duplicate the Nutella flavor)<br /><br />Update: Nutella now contains ""modified palm oil"" instead of the partially hydrogenated variety. It's nice of Ferrero to shell out the extra .03 per bottle not to use a substance known to be somewhat lethal, but I expect the flavor hasn't improved, or we'd all be hearing a lot more about it."
1,"This is the most acidic tomato sauce I've ever used. It's almost as tart as a lemon. I put it in an old family lasagne recipe, but neglected to taste it at first. By then it was too late.  I tried to soften the astringent taste with sugar and sauteed mushrooms, but this was only partially successful. The only thing that saved the dish were copious amounts of Bechamel sauce in the layering. They claim they use only Roma tomatoes, but I'm doubtful. I can't imagine any recipe that would benefit from this sauce."
1,"Crunchy, not too salty, always very fresh when I've bought these at Publix. Publix has them on sale from time to time for $4.  Whole foods price is usually around $5. No idea why you buy 3 and pay about 100% more.  Amazon needs to evaluate the price- perhaps should be a 8 pack for the same price."
1,"This used to be a great cereal, the only organic ""O""s cereal with the same taste, texture and mouth-feel as Cheerios.  The latest box I bought had a sweet coating that ruins the taste and feel.  Won't buy this again."
1,"While the product is great Home Naturals is a theif! I ordered this 2 boxes of the product from Home Naturals and they decided to ship only 1...... I am extremely irritated! :-("
1,"My dog refuses to eat it and it smells pretty bad. I can't recommend it as treat when my dog refuses to touch it."
1,"These biscuits easily break into large chunks and can choke your baby.  I just handed one to my 8 month old and it broke when he took it from my hand.  Thinking that was a fluke I handed him another one and he chomped off a huge piece that I had to sweep out of his mouth.  Don't buy these!"
1,"I have ordered this exact product in the past and have always received a wide variety of flavors and brands of k-cups.  This shipment was beyond poor in its selection, of the 34 kcups 16 of them were the same flavor and all 34 were the same brand.  Not impressed."
1,"I stupidly did not realize that this was the price for 1 10 oz. can.  You can buy this at the grocery store for $0.99/can. Your choice!"
1,"I've been enjoying BTT for 50 years-since I was a little kid!<br />Loved Vanilla and Banana best!  Great stuff-frig and smash!!!<br />Just got some in Los Angeles last year, and Guess What!  It Tastes like PLASTIC!!!<br />Excuse me!!! Plastic tastes WAY better!<br />So...if I want the Real Deal, I'll enjoy Charleston Chew which is...a million times better and more Natural than your Plastic!!!<br />Wretched!!! Congrats on ruining a memory! You and Broadway Strawberry Rolls-ABsolute Crap!!!!!!!  REAL Crap!!!!!<br /><br />iRa"
1,"I admit I ordered this bread with reservation. A ZERO carb bread with good taste? After a fairly lengthy period the bread finally arrived. I eagerly opened a loaf and liberally spread it with Butter and Carb free jelly.  It was without a doubt one of the worst tasting things I have ever encountered. I would rather just eat a cardboard box."
1,"I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark brown. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk."
1,"We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat."
1,"It wasn't tasty.  Kind of soggy and not very sweet.  Honestly, I threw it away after tasting it.  And for something that is raw and will spoil easily, as many raw things will, it was packaged in a non-resealable package that was just plain old plastic, not too sturdy."
1,"I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer."
1,"my dog loved them. I can not stand the, this is not jerky at all."
1,"I ordered the skim version of this product thinking it would cost me less Weight Watchers points. Well, it certainly accomplished that goal but the product is almost undrinkable. Thin and watery to an extreme. I find it hard to believe that they can't come up with a skim product comparable to the excellent skim cappuccino's available at Starbucks and Caribou. I would return this product if it wasn't such a bother. I can't believe this product made it through product development. Do yourself a favor and don't repeat my mistake in ordering this product."
1,"Horrible coffee, terrible bitter taste and a lingering aftertaste that I can't even describe!  Tried a lot of brands of K-cups and none have ever been so bad.  It's in a class by itself.  I love strong coffee,  and I gave this brand a try.  Guess I'll try another, I'm turned off of Emeril.  No Bam, just bust!"
1,"Bought this flavor because it sounded soo good but after making the first cup I realized that names can be deceiving. The sweetener aspect of the drink taste like sweet-n-low instead of sugar and has a bad after taste. Save ur money this  is not worth it."
1,"This product is absolutely disgusting! It doesn't even taste like chicken, its got this weird citrus flavor! Bleh, a total waste of money."
1,"Happy that I checked the ingredients! This dog food is not vegan! It has D3 instead of D2 added to it. Too bad..."
1,"Do not order from Taylor's!! I placed a Christmas order on December 16th and received notice that my order was confirmed.  However, on December 21st I received another notice from Taylor's stating that the item I had ordered was mysteriously ""out of stock"".  No phone call or personal apology, just a random email notice.  As a result, my Mother never received a Christmas gift from me and my family.<br /><br />I will never, ever place an order with Taylor's as this vendor is extremely shady and unreliable."
1,"Recently I purchased 96 k-cups of Bigelow Earl Grey Tea.  Subsequently, I went out and bought a box of Bigelow Earl Grey tea BAGS which is what I am currently enjoying.<br />The reason I'm using tea bags instead of the k-cups is that I don't particularly like<br />swallowing tea leaves.  With this batch of k-cups I have had loads of tea leaves in<br />my mug.  I tried using a small strainer which I placed over my mug during the brewing process.  The tea leaves still ended up in the mug.  So, now if I use a k-cup<br />I have to use a strainer with a paper coffee filter inside of it.  This is much too<br />much trouble.  I will NEVER buy tea k-cups again.  I will never buy any k-cups from<br />Amazon again."
1,"So this is sea salt, with added activated charcoal.<br /><br />Now I have nothing against activated charcoal -- it is indeed a miracle product and one of the few 'medicines' I have in the house.<br /><br />But, it will leach minerals and nutrients from what ever it is added to.  That is why it is part of the 'universal antidote'. (google this for more info).<br /><br />So, I use it topically for poisons  (insect bites ) and internally for some sicknesses, but never as part of my daily diet.<br /><br />This could be a poster product for the 'style over substance' culture..."
1,"I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware."
1,"I would love to review it but I have not received my cocktail onions and have not gotten any responses back about that from them!!!! Would you please respond???!!!!"
1,"These bars are dense, chewy, and dry. I didn't find them as horrible as other reviewers, but it seems like a lot of them are negative because it USED to be a great product. What infuriates me is the size of the product, which is NOTHING LIKE the picture on the package, and barely half the size of the individual wrapper! I wouldn't even call it a bar, it's only slightly rectangular, more like a small thumbnail-shaped chunk. Definitely check out the video that one reviewer posted to show the actual size. I certainly won't buy these again, and it makes me want to boycott the company, even if they make other, better-tasting GF products."
1,"for all of you out there thinking that 900 mg of Sodium is healthy, think again and make sure your will is ready. It goes without saying that if you eat this soup daily you would develop hypertension and later heart attack,  a truly heathy choice!!"
1,"I thought since the title of the product was ""Mocha Java"" it would have a chocolate taste - but it mostly tasted like plain coffee to me."
1,"Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.  OMG...what a disaster from the very first bowl with the new formula(which I did mix with some of the old stuff to transition him).  I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.  Canidae was ideal with the old formula...not so anymore...  Any suggestions out there on what I can transition to???"
1,"I usually choose english breakfast tea because it has a rich flavor.  This tea was practically tasteless. I could go out in my back yard and randomly pick weeds and it would taste better than this stuff.  I recommend Taylors of Harrogate if you're looking for english-style tea."
1,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store."
1,"Bought the teriyaki flavor .....TOTALLY GROSS,<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this slimy stuff.... Could barely finish my first bite....<br /><br />I gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow 0 star ratings..."
1,"Wow, the one star isn't based on the product itself, but the condition that my package came in... As soon as I opened it I know it was bad news. The container of the bottles was so gross and soggy from the drink leaking out of the bottles. I'm pretty disappointed since I've never  had a negative experience purchasing items on Amazon. Below are photos of what my package came looking like.<br /><br />[...]"
1,"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!"
1,"I should have known better. A friend offered me one. She went on and on about how healthy it is, so down the hatch. It taste like water that has had a cup of coins soaking in it. Just disgusting. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this nasty stuff."
1,"I bought this as part of a large order with other spices.  This seasoning is terrible.  The final product comes out chalky with a slight hint of jerky flavor.  Luckily, I ordered other spices that I will need to doctor this stuff up to make it passable."
1,"Amazon hasn't figured out how to get canned goods to the customer.  Every time, 90% of the cans are severely dented. Makes me fear food poisoning. If they could solve this problem I would order this soup & many other canned products regularly.  Buy the soup in a store. It's not bad...a bit too much tomato & carrot but good taste.  Amazon, please address this packaging / shipping deficiency. A few minor dents are acceptable but not cans that must be discarded."
1,"I have been feeding my puppy small amounts of these treats for about 3 months.  She has had two severe bouts with diarrhea, about 2 months apart.  I have had to take her to the vet, each time her tests have come up negative for anything but she was given Metronidazole and Cerenia and it helped heal her sickens.  Her last case of diarrhea, was VERY severe.  There was blood actually dripping out of her.  I did not catch on that it was the treats until I started reading other reviews stating the same situation.  Yes she love the treats but I think they definitely causes this!!!  Please do not risk it."
1,"My son loves all the Ella's Kitchen fruit & veggie pouches (along with Plum Organics as well). But this chicken meal... yuck. Not only does it not smell appealing, but it tastes awful. My son is 11 months and eats everything I put in front of him, but this Ella's Kitchen chicken meal (along with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081ZAVLE"">ELLA'S KITCHEN Oh So Creamy Chicken and Corn Mash, 4.5-Ounce (Pack of 7)</a>) is something he refuses to eat. I literally spoon it in his mouth and he sticks out his tongue and pushes it out as quick as he can.<br /><br />The only way I got him to eat this is by mixing it with fruit baby food (with a ratio of 2:1 fruit to chicken). I recommend sticking with homemade chicken. I have not tried other meat-based baby foods but given how Ella's Kitchen tends to be incredibly tasty, I can only imagine how bad other brands' food must be."
1,"This is a poor substiute for Mocha Latte.  It takes like water and has no body or flavor!  Bring back the Latte!"
1,"I was charged for this product by Liquid Nation and never received it.  Hard to review when you don't get your stuff.  Amazon really fell short on this one. Hope I can get my money back!"
1,"Seriously, $14.99 for this super small jar. It's not gold! Do not buy this product, it's extremely over priced! Why is there no reference to the size of the jar on Amazon's web site? Ridiculous!<br />Wow, just found this product at Honey Baked Ham locally for $6.99. Can't tell you how horrible a deal this is. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON!!!!!"
1,"This product had a very strange flavor to it.  The ingredients listed more natural grain alcohol and propylene glycol then strawberry flavor.  Maybe therein lies the problem."
1,"If it were possible to put minus stars on this review, I would.<br /><br />If you're thinking of joining their Coffee 'Club' - don't.  The customer service is abysmal, which calls into question their honesty as well as their efficieny.  My guess is it just complete apathy toward anything except saving and receiving money.<br /><br /> I called every month for almost six months about a bill.  Each time, several that the bill had been forgiven and that a supervisor and/or their accounting department would contact me.<br /><br />I never received any call or notice, just a bill.  I finally got a supervisor on the phone (after I was told several times that I COULD NOT CONTACT THEIR ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT).  The supervisor said that no one ever WAS going to contact me, so basically, ""sorry about the six months of NO SERVICE from our customer service department.""<br /><br />So my review is:  ""DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, YOU WILL BE TREATED AS IS YOU DON'T EXIST BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND A COMPANY WHO DOESN'T CARE TO TAKE THE TIME TO ADDRESS GRIEVANCES."""
1,"Wow this is truly horrible. The cereal taste like the cardboard box it is in, chemically, and it becomes almost instantly soggy after adding the milk creating this slimy texture. After chewing it, it does get stuck in your back teeth which is also annoying so it is definitely not on my to buy list. Contrary to their picture on the box, it is not filled, but rather a thin line of chocolate is drizzled inside. What are they thinking? Did they not have anyone in their facility try it out before mass producing it? NOT RECOMMENDED"
1,"I will never purchase this one again. In addition to not smelling or tasting like a cinnamon roll whatsoever, it also has a really burned taste to it. Perhaps change the name to charred cinnamon roll? Yuck."
1,"I purchased the pack of five for $23.59. what i got was one pack for 12.99.  when i went back to the site, i clicked on the pack of five and it took me to the page to order, but it didn't have the pack of five highlighted so i got the other.  i should have spotted that, but it was down lower than the screen.  it had the right type of cookie highlighted so i assumed(my favorite word)everything was correct.  this is the first time this has happened.  they need to fix this.  who would buy one package of cookies for almost half the cost of a pack of five."
1,"The grocery store for black-eyed peas is around $1.50 per pound. What makes this product (and many similar products available on-line) worth so much more? Local purchases do not involve shipping costs either. Check your local supermarket before you buy this stuff. 24 packages of beans would cost you $36."
1,"It says all natural but it tastes like it has an artificial sweetener. It leaves that horrible after taste. I am not a fan of plain water and was looking for something. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this drink."
1,"Of course my fault, because they do have the ingredients listed.  I gave it all to a food bank.  Thought about throwing it away but realize that maybe others may want to eat it.  What a quandry as they may or may not know that it contains hydrogenated oil which is so bad for our health. :(  There are alternative brownies brands on here that do not contain that....YAYYYY for those companies that offer quality products with quality ingredients!"
1,"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money."
1,"Great audio, until a few months in it just decides to stop working. Common problem: google it and you'll see. Cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world. Feels like a fast food toy.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product. Piece o' garbage."
1,"I purchased this as a gift, I am told that the tea's had a horrible taste!"
1,"This food was not only super messy, but it made my dog itch like mad! The kibble is very dusy/grainy. You touch it and kibble fuzz gets all over your hands, it was always getting stuck on my dogs face when he would eat. It could be that my dog is just allergic to corn, but having owned dogs in the past any food that contained corn almost always made my other dogs feet itchy too. I am not going to rant on about high quality food vs. low quality food, but some of the SD Dog foods out there are way over priced for the ingredients that are in them. The only reason I was feeding this to my current dog is because we adopted him and the shelter gave us a free bag; so we used it to transition him to new food with no corn."
1,"Ok, maybe it's me, but when I see that this is a sampler, with TONS of different flavors listed, I assume that I am going to get just that - tons of different flavors. Or atleast give me a similar number of each flavor. This order was a joke from the beginning. It arrived in a punctured box but perhaps that happened in delivery. I open the box and find a paper bag, stapled shut. I open the paper bag & find a bunch of tossed in k-cups. Then when I pull them out, I counted that I had like 9 of one flavor, and 1 of some and 2 or 3 of others... This really is incredibly unorganized. I will not buy from this vendor again."
1,"My son wanted cotton candy cupcakes for his 8th birthday so I searched online and found this flavor mix.  It's horrible.  When I opened it to mix with the frosting starter base, the flavor mix smelled of chemicals.  I asked my 8 year old to taste it and he hated it.  I tasted it and threw it away.  It's got a really bad after-taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth.  I would not recommend this product, at least the cotton candy flavor, to anyone.  Yuck. P.S. I gave it one star because that's the least I could give it."
1,"I'm not sure what they put in these chews, but our family almost had to leave the room when our dogs were chewing. The dogs liked them, actually ate them probably too fast but wow, add some dog saliva and run for your life! Won't be getting these again. Alas, my dog still has lousy breath despite the claims of oral hygiene benefits."
1,"To purchase these, you must buy 6 tubes and pay expensive shipping costs.  I was excited and willing because I love this flavor, but over time, I realized the unopened tubes were leaking on the box and the boxes were sticking to my pantry shelf.  I threw them all away which made it a complete waste.  I would have tried to rescue the paste earlier by putting it in plastic tubs and freezing or SOMETHING.  BTW, the expiration date on the unopened tubes was 16/11/2012. (European labeling)  The tubes appear to be about to explode which leads me to believe there could be possibly be bacterial contaminants?  I don't know, but something made these packages leak on the crimped edges. Obviously, I would not recommend OR buy them again."
1,"I was looking forward to treating myself with a yummy cup of hot chocolate.  When I took the first taste is was extremely disappointed.  I looked at the package and sure enough, the last ingredient was sucralose.  My husband gets migraines from artificial sweeteners.  After one drink he stopped but still got the headache. Bad move Green Mountain.  If your going to put artificial sweetener in you NEED to say something like ""reduced sugar"" or something to warn people to check a little closer!"
1,"What we were hoping for:<br /><br />Something a little more like the picture.  We were especially excited to try Chocolate Glazed Donut and Pumpkin Spice.<br /><br />What we got:<br /><br />6 - Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 - Caramel Vanilla Creme<br />6 - French Vanilla<br />4 - Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 - Cinammon Roll<br />3 - Southern Pecan<br />2 - Butter Toffee<br />2 - Mocha Nut Fudge<br />1 - Mudslide<br />1 - French Vanilla Supreme<br /><br />Sadly, we already have entire boxes of Wild Mountain Blueberry and Caramel Vanilla Creme, and the ones we were most interested in from this bunch we only got one or two of.  My mistake for not reading the reviews, but I disagree with the guy who said that the description covers the sellers behind when it comes to variety.  The description says that a buyer will get a ""wide variety"" and I hardly think 3 flavors comprising more than half of the package qualifies as ""wide variety"".  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  If I would have bought these flavors on the Keurig website, I would have paid less per K-cup than I paid for this package... and I paid the higher price specifically for the variety.  I do not feel I got what I paid for and I think Amazon should not allow this seller to continue falsely advertising.<br /><br />Final note:  The K-cups came in a paper bag ... with no visible expiration dates.  One of them was punctured on top.  Considering some of the other reviews, I am worried about whether or not these K-cups are even good anymore.  Some of the other reviews suggest that at least some people received theirs in a box with expiration dates included."
1,"Either I'm missing something and this is a double pack, which the description does not seem to support, or these people are insane.  There are loads of places to get this same product for $3.99, $4.99, even as high as $5.99.  What are they thinking?"
1,"The packing for this soup order was deficient and it arrived damaged, enough so that I threw it out. I have complained but heard nothing about it. Would like a refund to say the least."
1,"Our cat  MOJO has been eating Innova  for five years.  It arrived all crumbled and the cat no longer liked the food. I was getting ready to buy some more when I read the other reviews. My dog loves Blue Buffalo so I decided to order their cat food instead. The review process at Amazon is very helpful."
1,"I wanted to try this in my K-cup brewer because of the positive reviews and the lower price; however, I did not like the flavor of the fog chaser coffee.  I've since tried the rainforest blend, which is better, but still not as good as the Donut House k-cups from Coffee People,which I chose when the Kona blend was no longer available.  I'm debating whether to try the breakfast blend; too bad I have to purchase 36 of them just to try them, though."
1,"Let me start by stating that I absolutely LOVE Genmai Cha teas, so after reading a couple positive reviews I was extremely excited to order this tea in bulk.  I waited excitedly for my package to arrive, and now I wish for a return to this positive place of hope and excitement.  This tea has been nothing short of disappointing.<br /><br />I've had this tea for over a month now, and have tried adjusting my brewing in many ways, the best I have managed to achieve for flavor is underwhelming.  I love genmai cha for it's smooth baked flavor and scent.  I suppose I've just been lucky in the past to have bought quality teas.  Placing roasted rice in a sub par green tea seems to just produce a tea that goes straight from flavorless to bitter with no happy place in between.<br /><br />If you love green teas, this is one I'd avoid."

1,"These food trays are terrible. I requested them in my baby registry, and thank god I only got one. It is very very difficult to scoop the frozen food out, and frozen food even bends spoon if you try to spoon it out. I'm donating it first thing in the morning. I highly recommend purchasing single food pods that you can just toss into a lunch bag and go, and defrost independently wherever you are."
1,"I chose Westbrae's canned beans because they are organic. However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining. With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams from infants to the elderly, I don't think the product can still be called organic! it isn't any better than products sprayed with pesticides, which can be washed off many foods (not all, though). Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks.<br /><br />As additional information:<br /><br />I ordered a lot of food and other items when I made this purchase, thinking everything I ordered was from Amazon; but, while everything else Was shipped by Amazon, for some reason this one product ended up shipped by Nutricity.<br /><br />Nutricity charged more for the shipping than they did for the product, which amounted to $3.49 per can. At those prices, even without BPA in the cans' lining, these beans would not be worth that price!<br /><br />(I emailed Nutricity twice and they ignored me. I emailed Amazon twice, and after the second time, Amazon refunded the shipping charge due to ""the circumstances"" of the order.)"
1,"Whenever I open the cabinet w/ the catnip in it, my cat runs toward me like a bullet eager for her herbs.  I usually just buy it from the market - no fancy brand.  However, when I put Cosmic Catnip in her bowl, she came running as she usually does, but turned her nose at it and this was three days ago.  It is still sitting in her bowl untouched.  The store brand of catnip is gone in SECONDS. Clearly, Cosmic Catnip is not a favorite w/ my Peesh."
1,"Matcha is wonderful, but Pier Mall did not send matcha. Instead of .65 lb of matcha powder, I recd .5 lb of Chinese medicinal tea. The label was mostly Chinese and said 'matcha' nowhere. Prepackaged Chinese medicinal tea can be dangerous--it is completely unregulated, and people get sick all the time from bad ingrediants and unforseen reactions. I am asking for my money back and notifying Amazon."
1,"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money."
1,"pretty disappointed with this k cup. It's pretty watered down and i wish i didnt buy it. even on the 4oz k cup size, it tastes like its watery. i drink my coffee black and even at this cheap price it was a pure waste of money."
1,"I bought this from Amazon, and it came with two containers as if it was packaged for Costco.  The packaging was pretty, and the tea smelled and tasted great.  However, I can tell immediately that there was something familiar other than the two ingredients mentioned in the name from the taste and also from the appearance of the loose particles which you need to place them in a tea ball or paper filter yourself.<br /><br />So I take a look at the fine prints in the back of the container, and it lists ""licorice"" which I try to avoid because it is known to raise blood pressure.  It is considered dangerous especially if taken long term.  There are in fact many other side effects according to NIH.  I could not find this anywhere in the Amazon descriptions.  Very disappointed.<br /><br />[...]"
1,"I grew up in the area this wine is from. You drink it young, when there's still bubbles in the bottle. 2010 is left over stock that was shipped to the USA in a cynical nod that Americans don't know any better. Unfortunately, the exporters are right much of the time.<br /><br />Basically you can't buy a fresh Santa Margherita in the USA. As with their cheeses, oils and many other food products, the USA is a dumping ground for Europe's out-of-date food inventory."
1,"I was so surprised to see how tiny this basket is!!  I think it may be 12in height and 12in in length.  It looks a $15 gift basket and I don't even think the exact items or basket is used! I can see in this picture that the basket is ""taller."" I was very disappointed and I am so embarrassed to give this as a gift. I can't believe I paid $40 for it.  I'll probably go to Costco/ Sams for a better quality basket."
1,"First, these should be called Mac - Coconut bars, as Coconut is the #2 ingredient and Mango is #3.  Second, lots of people don't like coconut.  I happen to be allergic to it.  Word to Amazon that if you want happy customers to make things like this more prominent.  Thanks."
1,"terrible swill.  I can't belive this is from the company that WANTS to sell you their coffee maker.  Try the Millstone or if you can find it the Target brands instead."
1,"I have made purchases from you in the past. However, it is disconcerting to learn that a company selling flowers, the target market for which is women, (I would imagine), would give their advertizing dollars to such an individual as Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />This creature has spent much of his time actively promoting an anti-female agenda. This week he stepped over the line, even for him. I refuse to dignify his commentary by repeating it.<br /><br />Neither I or my friends will be using your company for purchases as long as you continue to advertise on his program. It is unfortunate that you have chosen to associate yourselves with such an enemy of women."
1,"no coffee taste at all.  the worst k-cup I've ever had.  the hazelnut flavor is nice but like drinking flavored water.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  Gloria jean hazelnut is not very strong either but at least it still tastes like coffee."
1,"I was hoping this was a good idea.  However we tried them even after I heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true.  Not the same as the stuff from the can."
1,"Usually I get everything I order from Amazon in timely manner and in good quality. This item was debited from my account, but I never received it. Now I am in the midst of a ""WHERE'S MY STUFF"" situation. So sad."
1,"The Macadamia Nut Butter was not very good tasting to me.  I love macadamia nuts, and thought the butter would be great.  Stick to peanut butter or almond butter.  Much better tasting products and will save you money.  Also, the jar is very small, so you are paying a lot of money per ounce."
1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1,"I love regular merengue cookies and I normally don't have a problem with sugar free, but these cookies had a terrible taste and worse texture.  Stick to the non sugar-free."
1,"This product has barley flour in it so how can it be gluten-free?  I get sick with even a minute amount of gluten in something so barley flour would not work for me.  I wonder why of all the gluten-free flours out there this company chooses barley flour which is not gluten-free?  I did some research on this and found that barley flour does contain gluten.  Surely I am missing something here as to why this product is marketed as gluten-free.  Perhaps the company can explain.  The bars sound really good and I love strawberry."

That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1,"I BOUGHT A BAG OF THESE THINKING ... AWESOME A LOWER CALORIE VERSION OF THE CHIPS I LOVE ... WELL UNEDUCATED LITTLE OL ME ATE 1 SERVING WITH LUNCH THE FIRST DAY ... FELT A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE (FIGURED IT WAS ME JUST BEING UNCOMFORTABLE)... ATE MAYBE 2 SERVINGS BY ITSELF A COUPLE DAYS LATER AND DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT ... BUT WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO I BEGAN TO HAVE THE WORST STOMACH CRAMPS AND THE FEELING OF INDIGESTION THAT LASTED ALL NIGHT INTO THE NEXT DAY.  I LOOKED UP THE 'FAT' REPLACE AND COME TO FIND OUT ... IT HAS SIDE EFFECTS!!! SIDE EFFECTS OF ABDOMINAL CRAMPS, LOOSE STOOLS, BLEEDING IN STOOLS, ETC ... I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS BUT SIMPLY PUT LOOK UP OLESTRA SIDE EFFECTS ... OH AND TO PUT CHERRY ON TOP ... OLESTRA OILS IS USED IN DECK STAINER AND PAINTS ... GO FIGURE ... WONT SAY ANYMORE BUT PLEASE EAT WITH CAUTION!!"
1,"Switched to this food and several of my cats had the runs.. after a month on this food, my 12 year old cat ended up at the vet's and they couldn't find anything wrong in the  metabolic tests or any other tests but he clearly had lost much weight and was shutting down physically. almost 300 dollars later and having him almost die, i switched back to katz'n flocken. he's now on the mend and his poop is showing form again.<br /><br />I think there's something potentially dangerous with this food."
1,"Ok, I thought I was getting a heck of a deal because it's $4.49 at the grocery store for one jar and this was listed as (6 X 8oz)and the shipping weight was listed as 6 lbs. Well, it's only one jar for over $1o so I returned it. I just received an email that indicated I returned it because of ""late shipping"". That was not the case! It was fraudulent because of advertising. They have since changed the wording of the description but wasted my time nonetheless."
1,"When we found out my daughter has celiac disease, we were on the hunt for a reasonable mac&cheese. We tried everything we could fine. This was one of the worst. The cheese flavor was pretty bad. I took one bite and had to spit it out. My daughter didn't like it either. I am keeping a spreadsheet of items we tried so we don't waste our money on it again in the future. The best mac&cheese we found was Annie's rice pasta and cheese."
1,"I've been drinking Caribou Blend for years and it is just right for my taste... or at least it was. Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on ""we listen to our customers"" and more corporate-speak BS."
1,"They look like all chocolate on the web site,but after the necco's arrrived it was clear they were not what what they appeared to be.They appeared to be all one flavor and all one color of chocolate. they were mixed chocolate i had to send the order back."

1,"These mini cookies are nothing like the original size cookies, it seems like taste and texture was sacrificed for this mini-version."
1,"If I could give this a 0 star (or really a minus 5) rating I would. I had to throw this ""bread"" away. It was the nastiest, stinkiest stuff I've ever had the displeasure of trying....ever. If someone tries to give you a loaf...run!"
1,"I love quinoa, so I was excited to try these flavored Roland Quinoa mixes for quick, easy side dishes.  I bought 3 varieties and tried the Mediterranean last night.  I was so disappointed!  It had a peculiar, almost medicinal taste. It was inedible. I hope the Black Bean and the Garlic flavors are a lot better. . ."

1,"Purchased this to add some spices to my pizza making...just don't like the flavors used in this spice mixture. Just doesn't taste like pizza seasoning to me. I would not purchase again or recommend."
1,"I bought this for our Christmas dinner. BIG mistake. What we received was a very small, and extremely overpriced turkey stuffed with little pieces of what may have been duck and/or chicken... and a lot of nasty-tasting stuffing. The proportions were NOTHING like what is pictured.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (frozen, stuffed) and the time it is traditionally served (Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner) you don't find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven... and by then you are stuck with it, because most of the stores are already closed.<br /><br />Despite the small amount of meat, it easily fed seven people, with ample left-overs... mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates, let alone went back for seconds.<br /><br />On a positive note, our dog loved the stuff and happily ate what everyone scooped into her bowl."
1,"My two dogs turn their noses up at this flavor dog food.<br />Even Mikey who eats anything when fed with the other dog won't touch it.<br />I don't understand why as the texture of the food looked fine and I hadn't noticed any usual smell to it.<br />There was some left over steak that I cut up into little bits and put in with the food and they managed to get the pieces out and leave the food.<br />Needless to say I am trying something else to feed them.<br />Other than the dogs not touching the food, it was delivered super fast and cans were all in tack."
1,"I mistakenly grabbed this Donut HOUSE blend at Costco thinking it was the Donut SHOP blend of k-cup (by Coffee People).  I realized it wasn't Donut SHOP the first time I made a cup.  It was REALLY light - basically colored water, very little flavor if made on the recommended 8 oz brew size.  Not much better on a lower setting either.  If you like a very, very mild coffee, then this is for you.  I'm not a fan of strong coffee, but this was WAY to mild and I'll be making sure I'm getting the Coffee People Donut SHOP coffee rather than Donut HOUSE in the future!"
1,"K-Cup coffee was supposedly barely out of date, but tasted very, very old and I could not afford to order from Amazon as the ones I got were from Moriah Acres."
1,"The first shipment was stale.  The second case was not as stale but stale nonetheless.  I'm not sure if it is staleness or just plain grossness.  I like other chips by Garden of Eatin'.  Will the birds eat them?  What do I do with all these chips?  Amazon was great about sending me a replacement when I complained about the first case."
1,"After some of the safety issues regarding products made in China (Lead in toys, Melamine in milk, etc.) i'm very hesitant to consume fods products which are manufactured there.  When purchasing a ""higher end"" product such as this one, one doesn't expect that it would be made in China.  I'm not even sure if I should eat these. I definitely will not be purchasing these again, and in the future would prefer to purchase from companies who produce their products in countries with higher standards for food production."
1,"How do I find expiration date on these Mars bars? I tried one, and it tasted stale. Product not returnable."
1,"I read all the reviews before buying this product.  I can not tell a difference by taking this supplement.  I think it may have caused upset stomach.  For the caling effect I have noticed nothing.  I have been taking a week and a half and will allow more time"
1,"I read all the nice reviews here before i made the purchase.  But it is really not my 'cup of tea'.  All the nice descriptions could not help.  It tastes like medicine.  On top of that, of course it is not returnable.<br /><br />I am going to see whether my colleague would enjoy them.  I am happy as long as I do not have to drink it myself."
1,"I bought some of this stuff at my local grocery store recently, hoping that I could save myself the trouble of making my own from scratch. Compared to the stuff I make, this was just nasty. For some reason, it tasted strongly of nutmeg (or at least of what I *hope* was nutmeg--God only knows what they put in this stuff.)<br /><br />Anyway, you can make your own country gravy from scratch without too much difficulty and it's way better than this. I'd take a pass if I were you."
1,"I saw this Chai Tea when I was shopping here for the Tazo Chai Tea.  I read the 3 reviews which all gave 5 stars so decided to give it a try.  I have to say I am totally disappointed.<br /><br />No real flavor what so ever.  I was expecting a Chai Tea with a little bit of bite and I got quite a bit of nothing.  The description written up by the manufacture made the tea sound wonderful.  Again the 5 stars by the reviews sold me, the taste did not.<br /><br />I would never recommend this tea to anyone, and as for me I'm sticking with Tazo."
1,"When I opened the first package in this delivery, I found that all except 2 of the cookies were broken, many of them were just crumbs.  Something must be wrong with the packaging that this is possible.  I had a similar problem with cookies that were packed in a bag, so it was understandable in a way, but these were in trays, so it should not have happened.  If the other three packages are also ""crumby,"" I will definitely discontinue this subscription."
1,"Don't waste your money!<br />I drink only peppermint tea and by now I became an expert in it. This is NOT peppermint or anything close to it. I get more flavor from the cheapest tea in the supermarket. The leaves are crushed too small and they smell like grass or weak oregano. No taste, except for some bitterness (grass?). I am trying to see how to return it. OOOPPPSS can't return it. I will give it to my cow : )"
1,"This is the worst tasting garlic I have ever had! If you want to destroy EVERYTHING you need GARLIC as an ingredient do not use this product! Use dried granulated or powder but better yet; go on the internet and find the GARLIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD ---- Gilroy, California."
1,"I will never know how this product is.<br />Amazon/Starbucks chose to send this order with the requirement I sign for it!  Why they would do this on a $20.00 order is beyond me.  I work and am not home to sign for packages.  The package was returned and Amazon/Starbucks has yet to reply to my emails or even return my money.<br />This in my first Amazon disappointment and I have ben a customer for nearly 10 years."
1,"This arrived at least a week late with no refrigeration. Upon opening the package, I found it was warm and smelled a bit strange. I would have sent it back, but it was stinking up my home and had to be disposed of. As for a refund, I'm still wondering if I want to banter with the monkeys who sent it. It took them long enough."
1,"First off, allow me quote the label.  ""Tabasco Habanero Sauce is made from the world's hottest pepper.""  What?!  That's funny, I don't see the word 'jolokia' nor 'scorpion' anywhere in the ingredients.  How is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim?<br /><br />False advertising aside, I bought a bottle for thirty-five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled.  The moment came and I shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig..and...nothing.  Minutes later, another big swig; a third of the bottle now gone.  I waited patiently to no avail.  Maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin, but not me.  So, thankfully I didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment.  Maybe ithe positive reviewers drank a whole gallon and that's where I went wrong.  Yes, I am a SHU snob, and if you need to look up what ""SHU"" is, then this sauce is for you.  Even Tabasco's website, which doesn't require a recall to correct, is loaded with inaccurate [read deceitful] claims.  I've had hotter jalapenos from Domino's pizza than Tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce.  Stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream Tabasco; you're way out of your league.<br /><br />That said, this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids.  Certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast.<br /><br />But hey, this is just my opinion.  Much like Tabasco's opinion on ""the world's hottest pepper""; no real merit.<br /><br />Worth noting, this is only the second time I've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which I have little of to share my opinion."
1,"I bought six can of these wafers and all the wafers were smashed!!!, what a pity!. It is most the cost to return them, that I just put them on the trash. AMAZON SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WHEN SELLING and PACKING THIS TYPE OF ITEM, THIS ARE VERY FRAGIL, SO WHEN I OPENED THE BOX THEY WERE NOT WELL PACKED. I am so disappointed because I wasted my money."
1,"I was excited to buy these ""chips"" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!"
1,"I got the 5 lbs bag.  Received it right away but this has too many shells."
1,"Just a warning....these chips are Not gluten free as they claim to be.  They clearly state on the back of the<br />package that they are manufactured  in a facility with wheat.

1,"I m a fan of this soup maker; I have purchased Bear Creek Creamy Potato and Brocolli Cheddar in large cans, each sufficient for 24 servings. Bear Creek shipped them directly to me, but their phone no longer works nor does their email address.They were well priced at 10.00, kept forever, and much could be done to these soups to make a short and simple meal fancy enough for friends. So, as a trial, I ordered this soup-in-a-sack from Amazon. The shipping box had no padding; soup was spilled from a couple of the sacks....and there seems to be teeth marks in the sacks of soup....so,upon openning the package, I immediately,emailed Amazon asking them to get this soup out of my kitchen. They never replied. I do not recommend any Bear Creek in a sack products....not only because of a critter problem but also since they are far more expensive than the large cans."
1,"Beware...these are made in China.  I personally would never purchase a food product from China, and it was obvious on this listing that this are in fact Made in China."
1,"This is the worst coffee I have ever bought. It stinks really bad. The beans are very oily which is bad for the grinder (I have a super automatic). The taste is bitter and dark and strong...not smooth and rich like the Lavazza I usually get. I have no clue why anyone would give this coffee a good rating, unless the beans they sent vary A LOT and I got a bad bag. Then I tried to contact them and I cannot find any reference anywhere. Never again!<br /><br />2 weeks later....I want to add that I sent the coffee beans back to Amazon and they refunded my money! Thank you Amazon...once again you have proven to be a great company!"
1,"This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it."
1,"Oberto should be ashamed putting out jerky like this. I am embarrassed calling this ""jerky"". thin, completely flavorless, aside form hints of soy sauce and STALE.  YUCK.  We used to buy a lot of oberto's jerky, though switched to turkey jerky lately....tried this,,,,,,,,,,,and NEVER AGAIN.  This jerky is garbage that even my dog would not dare chew.  Since my family of 6 all eat jerky and ALL have different taste for jerky - we end up buying a lot of different brands/types - but no one liked this one, not even remotely close.  too many other comparably priced jerky brands out there to be wasting money on this junk."
1,"GREAT just dandy Frickin' Cytomax uses carmine as a color additive. Here's how carmine is made:<br /><br />To prepare carmine, the powdered scale INSECT BODIES are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum is added to the clear salt solution of carminic acid to precipitate the red aluminium salt, called ""carmine lake"" or ""crimson lake.""<br /><br />Carmine is insect soup. Yummy!<br /><br />For crying out loud Cytomax. take the danged bugs out of your mix!<br /><br />And AMAZON posts what appears to be a list of ingredients that does not list carmine.<br /><br />Cytomax, most of us are adults and aren't overly concerned with color of our drink. We are not children squawking about the color of our kool-aid being off and refusing to drink it.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about Cytomax, besides the bug soup, it would be the color is ridiculous! Who needs such a fluorescent orange color to drink it! It goes is an opaque bottle anyway...who really looks at it.<br /><br />Cytomax is another company that has over thought the entire deal and basically ruined an other wise great product.<br /><br />Sending mine back.<br /><br />W"
1,"The sugar substitute and another ingredient used in all these products is a strong laxative, its unbearable and therefore uneatable. The bars taste great and would be the best out there except you will regret it within 30 minutes. For crying out loud, everyone knows maltodextrin AND maltitol is a serious diuretic/ laxative, use splenda."
1,"I went out of my way to order this thinking I would get the old formula, the package that you see in the picture.  Nope, sent the ""Smartblend"" I was trying to avoid and there are no returns accepted on this item.  Not happy about this bait and switch....beware on this one.<br /><br />My first real issue with Amazon after many purchases....."
1,"These were the sweetest tasting, icky, sticky fruit twisters.  My son is addicted to candies and I thought these would remind him of fruit roll ups.  Instead they are like thick twizzlers that are very sticky and sweet.  In fact, even my son said they were too sweet and he won't even taste the other flavors!"
1,"This used to be a great food, but they've changed the formula and my dogs have suffered.  Their customer service is very rude.  My dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula.  Explosive Diaherra, Vomiting, Fur became dull.  Change it back Canidae!!!"
1,"$36 for 32 packs. Are you Kidding? The first packs I bought at BJS cost about $7.00 for 32 packs. You can often get a 7 pack at Target on sale for $2.  Love the almonds and still eat them every day but No Thanks!"
1,"These treats are very hard and apparently not very tasty.  The cats who need it won't eat it.  The cat who will eat anything, does eat them, but he isn't the one who needs them!"
1,"So I found this on the super cheap and was interested to try it.  We are bug into spices, seasoning, marinating and trying all sorts of ways to use new things on or in our food.  So here is a break down of what went on in our basket.<br /><br />Hickory Smoked Salt, Black Hawaiian Salt, - Not bad, but not all that different from sea salts.<br />Mustard with Horseradish - There was no vaccum seal to the top anymore so there was no way this would be safe to eat, in the trash it went.<br />Spicy Tomato Chutney - by itself it is too tart even for a chutney however it worked great as a chicken marinade.<br />Mint Jelly - So so.<br />Chutney with Curry - This I did not like at all.<br />Smoked Salmon - Gave it to my cats because that was about all it was good for.<br />Smoked Salmon Jerky - Completely dried out and flaky.<br />Thick Woven Wicker Basket  Reeks of salmon and salt, wheeeee!<br /><br />Also there was the random jar of Raspberry sugar crystals.  I don't think anything in this basket qualifies it for a BBQ basket either, so the name bothers me, even though I knew what was in it."
1,"Gerber has an amazing line of products for babies and toddlers, but this product is a miss.  The Wagon Wheels are extremely hard.  They do not dissolve at all in the mouth.  I had hoped they would be similar to the puffs Gerber makes (only larger), but they are nothing like them.  We had to toss these.  I was scared my child would hurt her teeth or choke."
1,"Yes, I grew up with these too.  I was going to purchase some for old time's sake and checked the website.  Contains lard. In this day of heart and cholesterol awareness, I'm surprised that this is still the case.  It shouldn't be that difficult to change the recipe slightly to eliminate lard, and call it a vegetarian friendly product."
1,"I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst; which then caused so many frequent late night forays to go outside to relieve herself we lost hours of sleep. Thinking it was her age we let it go for awhile then I decided to take her off the varied brands of dehydrated chicken breast (all without additives) and within a week she no longer empied bowls of water and had to go out all night long. It may react on her differently because of her age but for others who may experience this problem you may need to take your dog off this type of treat...I'm now using the Purina Chicken Carvers (I know chemicals) but she no longer is having problems..go figure... I guess dogs are all different too huh?"
1,"These are absolutely terrible.  I bought them b/c they were the only whole grain tortillas that I could find at the time.  They have awful texture and they absolutely do not taste like a tortilla should.  To top it off they aren't vegetarian (or Kosher or Halal as far as I know).  Why would you put gelatin in a tortilla?!?! Ridiculous."
1,"At the time i bought this the description said it suppose to bring 3 boxes for each sale.  I made 2 orders and literally only received only 2 boxes.  I contacted amazon and they tried to send me the item again with the appropriate amount as the description says.  Again, only 2 boxes came with the package.  I got fed up and didnt even wanna deal with it anymore.  Im giving this item a 1 star based on the false description/amount you get from ordering this item.  The cereal itself is good."
1,"After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it, I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come.  Unfortunately for me, the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly. But I stuck with it, started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production. While I'm sure it works for some, if you're just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with, I don't think taking this will increase your supply much if at all. But if you think you'd like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you!"
1,"We're very disappointed. We love flavored coffee but when we tasted Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Cinnamon Flavored - it was terrible! It tasted like we were licking an ashtray. It has a burnt-grounds flavor. I highly recommend not wasting your money on this product."
1,"If you like a hint of the past then this stuff is for you. All I can say is what a disappointment...<br />The problem with these, Archer Farms and Kettle Valley are that all Fruit Leathers have become APPLE leathers with a smattering of the desired flavor in puree form. There used to be real pure fruit leathers made from the actual fruit (Apricot, Strawberry, etc) but for some reason they disappeared from the market about 10 years ago (last company I recall was 'Nature ...' something). I guess like everything else these days the emphesis is 'make it on the cheap' and forget the real quality.<br /><br />It's a shame if it's merely a cost decision, there's a bonafide market out there for the real thing even if it's a little more expensive."
1,"I ordered the pecan tin as a Christmas present for my secretary December 7th. The product was never delivered to me nor did anyone contact me. I called Taste of the South the first week of January to inquire about the status of the order and was told that I would be called back when they figure it out. No one ever returned my call. Finally, I called the sales representative again and she confirmed that my account would be credited for the error. Today is January 24th, 2004 and still no credit has been applied to my credit card. This is a very small and completely disorganized business, avoid the mess and buy from someone else."
1,"I put 2 drops into 3 scrambled eggs and mixed it up well. I took one bite and spit it out within 5 seconds and this junk burned the heck out of me.<br /><br />I'm not Mr. Hot Food but I do like spicy food. This stuff may not be poison but it isn't food in my opinion. What kind of people make a dopey product like this? There is a mild warning and a caution to use a drop at a time but that warning is inadequate.<br /><br />It was about 10 minutes of legitimate suffering that was completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Don't buy this junk!"
1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1,"The sad thing is, I like the way this soup tastes. However, 1 portion--which is 1/2 a can--has 760 mg of salt, or 32% of daily! If you eat the whole can, that is 64% of daily salt!<br /><br />Imagine, cut down on salt and I'll give this soup 5 stars! Until then, I will never buy this again!"
1,"I've had the Nacho and beef. They were great. This tastes like an old salad bar mixed with butt. It is terrible. Enjoy the other flavors though!"
1,"I have been an avid Celestial tea drinker for a number of years and this<br />by far was a favorite of mine, until they changed it.<br />  Not only did the company decide to package it differently , they have also<br />added a blend of white tea in it. In my opinion they ruined a perfectly good<br />product.<br />  The tea itself seems weaker to me, not smoother.<br />For the past year, this tea, prior to the change, was difficult to find in my local<br />grocery store.  I purchased it online and was fully satisfied until the last shipment arrived<br />and the new tea was sent. Needless to say, I won't be buying this again unless the company returns<br />back to the original , which was superior to this by far.<br />  Why oh why can't companies leave things alone? New does not necessarily mean better and in this case<br />it rings true."
1,"It looks like dung and tastes horrible. If you want to have an experience of disgusting yourself, buy it and try it!"
1,"I adore their black, and since the store was out, I bought some of this. Ugh. I tried it, then I kept eating since I paid money for it, until finally I just couldn't finish it, and it sits in my pantry. I think I will throw it away today."
1,"I was so excited to brew my first cup of apple cider and so disappointed when I found out it was sugar free.  My husband and I both hate the aftertaste of artificial sweeteners and I refuse to give them to my children.  The advertisement should include this information in the listing."
1,"I have purchased this item 2 or 3 times from Amazon, and the quality of the coffee is very good.  The price I normally paid was about $21 .  Now its being sold by this new seller ""Deals on Call"" for $53.95 !!!  and for the exact same product.<br /><br />I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing this product to wait until Amazon has it again, or buy it somewhere else.  This price is completely out of touch with reality, and is obviously trying to take advantage of unsuspecting buyers."
1,"I was very disappointed that they have now raised the carb count in this cereal from 9 net carbs to 16 net carbs.  I have insulin resistance and my nutritionist told me this was the only cereal I could have.  It tasted great!  My local ShopRite stopped carrying it a while ago because it wasn't selling, so I had to purchase it elsewhere.  I called the company and they said they were relaunching it in July.  I was so happy to see it back on the shelves, but now they've change it.  Even the sugar level went up.  I just wish there was another cereal on the market that had 9 grams of carbs or less.  Oh well, I'll surely miss it."
1,"After eating TANG's chocolate and double-chocolate cookies, all other cookies will taste like expired, tepid dogfood to you. Her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible. Tim Horton's, Timothy's, Second Cup, Starbucks, Treats and those horrid packaged cookies at Zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a TANG cookie. HER COOKIES ARE DA BOMB!!! A+++++++ Hawt damn!"
1,"This was a very weak tasting product. It was a watered down hot chocolate at best. I was hoping that it would be an Organo Gold product that I would enjoy. I will not purchase it again."
1,"Yuck! This has a chalky chocolate taste mixed with toothpaste. Not good. I wish I hadn't purchased a 10 pack."
1,"The cans arrived all banged up.  I will never order from this company again."
1,"This has a smoky taste that is so strong and awful tasting.  How anyone gave this a high rating is beyond me.  I only ate two bites and got a headache.<br />I only eat fat free or low fat dressings so it's not like I was trying a ff product for the first time. Truly horrible product."
1,"I was expecting two packs of these like the description said, instead I only got one box.  It was a total rip off."
1,"This is the worst green tea I have ever had. Don't be fooled by the pristine picture on the packaging. This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be ""organic"" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad."
1,"This product is made in China.  I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher.  Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?<br /><br />Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore."
1,"Nordic naturals uses animal-derived gelatin (porcine) in their children DHA, for this product ""gelatin"" is listed among the ingredient without any other specification. Please consider that this term generally means that this is an animal-derived gelatin. Nordic Natural I expected more from you, at least in term of clarity."
1,"These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones."
1,"I actually bought these white noodles along with the brown shirataki noodles to try out and I threw these noodles out along with the other bags. I couldn't help gag from the stench of these noodles. You can rinse them, but it makes me wonder why on earth these noodles smell so bad in the first place. If whatever is in these noodles is making this smell, (like chemicals), I don't want these in my body. These things must be bad because they don't even sell them anymore from this company."
1,"I ordered 3 containers of this butter.  They arrived wraped in plastic and literally had oil dripping from them when I pulled them out of the plastic.  It was a complete oily mess.  Because of the paper label and the oil, well, the label soaks up a lot of oil and you'll never get it all off.  For a few months I used one container (I threw the other two out) everytime I handled it I had to wash my hands when I was done to try and get the oil off.  Also, the butter did seem rather.... old... It didn't taste exactly right.  Like I said, I used one, but threw the others out.  Maranatha has great butters, but don't but their almond butter here.  For my next order I bought some Justins Nut Butter (almond) and that stuff is very good.  It's also vacuum sealed so even if the lid was loose, it's not going to leak, and there's no layer of oil on the top of the butter either.  Oh yeah, it also tastes fantastic.  Want to know a great sandwich?  Almond butter and raspberry.  Delish!"
1,"When you do a search on Amazon for (pumpkin seeds unsalted) this product is showing up. I wonder what is Amazon percentage to sell this product under a false category!"
1,"I've been drinking tea since I was very young- English mother- and this tea is the most bitter tea I have ever tasted, so I threw the whole case away- no one wanted it. I went back to Tetley."
1,"$5.99 for this?<br /><br />Its a great item but u can get it much cheaper for 2.99 at Rite Aid or other drug store.  DO NOT over pay for this here; waste of $."
1,"I love this cereal so when I saw a big sale on the 4.3oz boxes of it I bought 48 boxes!  Halfway through our first breakfast my wife realized that the little black seed looking things in the cereal were actually little dead bugs!!!  Once she said that I started looking in my bowl and realized it was full of them!  I'm a big fan of the cereal but will NEVER purchase any from Amazon or probably off the internet for that matter.  Grocery store is fine with me!  Buyer beware!"
1,"Our Great Pyrenees has to take antibiotics for three weeks and figured out the cheese trick after a few tries.  So I bought these, and he chewed the greenie and spit the pill out.  His mother will down almost any food without swallowing, but my dog insists on chewing, therefore, he finds the pill.  Waste of money.<br /><br />If your dog is a ""chewer"", I'd think twice."
1,"Totally disappointed in buying this product from Amazon. It was OLD, STALE and completely TASTELESS.  It turned out it was a few days from it's expiration date. Please note my complaint has nothing to do with Folger's Hazelnut Decaf coffee, which I drink regularly: what I find disappointing is that Amazon would dare to sell a product in such deplorable condition. Even my tiny local grocery store would have removed it from their shelves months ago... if they carried it.<br /><br />From this experience I've decided to stick to buying only books from Amazon."
1,"I purchased 2 33 oz. bags of 8 o;clock columbian whole bean coffee from Amazon.Ive been using this brand for about 1 year. The 1st bag the beans had no oil on them, but made a decent cup of coffee. I just opened the 2nd bag and was very disapointed,the beans were dried out,they smelled like staw and had a bad taste. I will not waste my money on this product again."
1,"UGH!  I had just discovered the rich roasted with slight vanilla flavor and then I buy a second bag and was shocked to see the light roast of any cheap flavored coffee.  I called in to their customer service and of course they didn't know what I was talking about.  I love Starbucks for the rich bold roast and now this new version is just like the Dunkin Donat or other flavored water that they pass off as coffee.  I realize they are probably trying to get those customers that like crappy brown water but come on Starbucks remember your BRAND IDENTITY!!!!!"
1,"Literally does nothing but take up space. Bugs walk around and are not even remotely interested in stopping in. I'm not sure if the ""lure"" even works. I also don't see how they would actually stick to the box...doesn't seem sticky enough."
1,"A couple of years ago I discovered Seattle's Best French Roast ground coffee, which was delicious and a good value, as a 3-pack of 12 oz bags from Amazon was only $18.  This quickly became my daily coffee fix.  Recently, however, the original packaging changed (I understand the company was bought by Starbucks), and so did the coffee.  Now called Level 5, the coffee seems OK when brewed immediately after opening the bag, but beginning the next day or so after opening, a freshly brewed batch tastes burnt and has an odd chemical flavor.  Like another reviewer, I cleaned my pot and tried a different coffee maker (one at work), but the coffee still tastes bad. I have now tried all three bags from my last order, and each makes the same unpleasant coffee.  To compound this disppointing change in coffee quality, the price on Amazon has gone up from $18 (with free shipping via Amazon Prime) to $41.95 + shipping costs for a 3-pack from an outside supplier.  Amazon and Seattle's Best have both lost my business on this one."
1,"This gum has Maltitol in it which can cause gastric distress to people sensitive to this ingredient.  It also has Mannitol and Sorbitol, these are all within the first 4 ingredients of the gum!  Be careful if you are sensitive to these sweetener replacements.  Just chewing 2 pieces gave me an upset stomach within an hour of chewing.  My mistake, I should have paid better attention to the list of ingredients on package."
1,"I assume market forces dictated that Cascadian Farms add sugar and a more ""refined"" appearance to their cereal, but now it's just another box of sweetened junk--albeit organic junk. Too bad. Me and my two-year-old son were very happy customers--but now we'll have to look elsewhere. And I'll have to start reading the ingredients of everything I buy from Cascadian Farms with a skeptical eye, now that I know what their business plan is."
1,"This is just awful soup with so much black pepper, I nearly choked on it.  It had a burnt taste.  Very poor quality control on this item.  I was shocked because this brand's chicken broth is very good."
1,"These were the worst candy fish I have ever had. I had to throw them away."
1,"Very disappointed, not much pumpkin or spice, just pretty close to plain old coffee.  I was hoping for something like they have at Tim Horton's but its not even close."
1,"I thought this was great until I came to the tangerine flavor.  Wow what a disappointment!  It ruined the whole batch.  It tasted like, ...mmm fish oil! The smell was tangerine, but the taste, not so much.  I didn't understand that I had ordered this to come once a month, so now I am getting another 3, yes 3, 30 packs!  I just have to throw out the tangerine.  What a waste of money.  I read some of the other reviews and I guess the tangerine might taste like baking soda.  But I didn't even think it was that good."
1,"I would not order again, hot chocolate would tastes much better than this plain test, I'm very dissatisfied. I think it was such a waste of money. I am going to give them away as office freebee."
1,"It sucked, cause I never got it, until this day I never heard from the sender, the good think was that I got my money back."
1,"I hate to be THAT person, but these are gross. Buffalo wings are one of my most favorite foods ever but these do not taste like buffalo wings. They taste really sour, then really spicy and hot, and WAY WAY WAY too salty, and I love my salt! I can't pick up a good flavor with these. I'm really sad because they sounded amazing. I recommend the ""Everything"" Pretzel Crisps."
1,"First of all almonds are so delicious that no agave is needed to sweeten them.  Agave is actually worse than HFCS.<br />This is a horrible product.  Buy your own raw almonds and make your own almond butter for much less."
1,"I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated."
1,"I am used to ordering the nibs and grinding them myself.  The result is the richest chocolate flavore one can imagine!  This on the other hand left a gritty texture in the pudding I made and has a bitter flavor that could not be masked by even major amounts of sugar and very mild hint of chocolate.  First time ever my daughter said she didn't want her 'chocolate' pudding."
1,"I got all excited when I saw this at WalMart and didn't hesitate to drop it in my cart. I've become a huge fan of Green Mountain Coconut Island K-cups and since I had just ran out, I thought I'd try this. I didn't even bother to read the box...just figured it was coconut so thought it'd be similar.<br /><br />I first suspected something wrong watching it brew. My cup was rapidly filling up with with heavy white foam. The liquid coming out of the brewer from the k-cup was running whitish clear, very weak looking.<br /><br />My first taste was my last. No way could I bear putting another sip in my mouth. I'm a huge fan of flavored coffee and drink lots of medium brews, not much into the heavy ones. But I'd NEVER ruin my coffee putting milk in it. To a horsegal, well, no self-respecting cowboy or cowgirl adds white stuff to her joe...<br /><br />This coconut mocha - all I could taste was disgustingly way over-sweet and loaded with cream. YUCK! I just couldn't get those two awful flavors out of my mouth. I barely smelled or tasted any coconut and almost no mocha either...<br /><br />Taking the opened box back to WalMart along with this review printed out and demanding my money back."
1,"If you like pickled carrots, you'll like this product.<br />I'm not anal enough (yet) to break down a jar of this stuff by weight, but I'm guessing it's 75% carrots by weight.<br /><br />Big mistake, don't buy anything from DeLallo!"
1,"I first tried FRS when I got a free sample in a package I ordered from a bike shop here on Amazon.  To be honest, most drinks that cost this much is almost criminal in that most buyers thinking that they are getting some sort of magic potion to make them feel better, run faster or jump higher.  Most of the time you would be better buying sugar free Kool Aid and adding a couple of vitamin tablets to it.  There is no scientific basis for sports drinks except for one caveat.  If you sweat a lot during your exercise, you will do yourself a favor by replacing electrolytes and a few calories but stay away from a lot of sodium salts.  Having said that, this drink and many others should not be used by people who have GERD (gastro-esopogeal reflux disease) as it will cause reflux and heartburn due to the citric acid in the drink.  Overall, this drink and many others really have no value for most people and considering the price of these additive type drinks, you can purchase a membership in a health center and then drink water when your there.  I am a bicyclist and often ride in very hot, humid weather and I drink a watered down sports drink, but its cheap and only has a few calories and can be purchased at a local big box store.  Save your money and don't buy expensive drinks like this one."
1,"I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just ""something she picked up,"" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!"
1,"I've only been on a gluten free diet for four months, so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid.  The worst part is that Amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this.  I'd put it out for the squirrels but I'm not sure they'd eat it.  If you're expecting something that tastes anything like bread, you're in for a shock."
1,"I ordered the chocolate and vanilla based on all the positive reviews. Big mistake!! I tried the chocolate first, and wondered if it was spoiled it tasted so weird. Then I tried the vanilla and got the same icky taste. I don't know how the positive reviewers can stand this stuff!! It is like a sour, almost metallic taste, and kind of grassy too. Yuck!! The rest of it is going in the trash. Don't waste your money."
1,"Regular flavor Budda Bones are great for my dogs but they apparently do not care for the minty flavor on these."
1,"The cups are about half full of coffee at best so that mostly all you get is brown water with a hint of coffee flavor.  I will drink it because I paid for it, but I would not offer it to a guest."
1,"I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee."
1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three.

Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her.

No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1,"Bought this to go with  20 lb of Basmati rice. I'm sure there was a review here that said it tasted like fresh cut grass,<br /><br />It tastes like cut grass on the bottom of the lawn mower after a week.<br /><br />Found out  Basmatti doesn't need seasoning, just a little salt."
1,"These were of a different quality than the first bag of 20 chews I purchased online.  They were the same brand, but the package was different and they were much lower in quality.  My dog had diarrhea for two days after downing one of these.  They were darker and different colors, compared to the first batch which were white and consistent. I'm almost afraid to order online again."
1,"This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn't find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful. save your money and buy any other tea out there."
1,"I purchased this product based on my research on the internet and the reviews on Amazon regarding this product's lack of aftertaste, low glycemic response, and mainly because people stated it had no gastric effects as Xylitol does.  I used it this morning in a banana bread recipe.  This afternoon I began paying the price and a few minutes later everybody near me began paying the price with me.  This impacted my gut exactly the way all sugar alcohols do.  I'll be passing this item on to my sister with diabetes.  Her meds already tear up her gut so she probably won't notice as much.  Back to the drawing board for me."
1,"I'm afraid, after reading the other reviews, that perhaps I may have purchased a 'bad batch' or something (I purchased from Costco like one of the other reviewers) as I absolutely did not like this product at all.<br /><br />I love quinoa, brown rice & quinoa/rice blends. I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course. The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. I normally expect packaging to be misleading but in the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort. Simply buy something else.<br /><br />But, please, do yourself a favour and don't buy this."
1,"i have used hawaiian salt and it's always been a fine grind.  this very coarse grind is not what i expected and i wish it would have been in the description - i will definitely never buy this again"
1,"This product have no flavor at all, I could not taste apple or any other! It was just something sweet. Also it had a bad smell!<br />Am used to the Haribo bears, sold in the US market, they have a noticeable taste, they are made in Turkey. While these bad Frogs are made is Spain....maybe that why they taste and smell funny!!?"
1,"Despite its appealing list of ingredients (This green tea blend contains Japanese sencha green tea, dried ginger, orange peel and lemongrass), I found the tea disappointing.  After ample steeping, The blend remains devoid of flavor, color and aroma.  The tea teeters between having 'less taste' than expected and being 'tasteless'.  It may seem a bargain when purchased in bulk but if you're looking for a flavorful green tea blend tea, look elsewhere."
1,"These are very frustrating! Bought this huge box for some friends arriving from Mexico who love espresso. The water just can't get through this coffee! SOOOOOOO frustrating and a waste of money. Ground too finely!"
1,"I bought a box from local grocery store, and was so disappointed! It's just regular instant coffee in a k-cup! No coffee ground in it at all! The coffee tasted even worse than instant in a jar. You could so easily put a table of instant coffee in hot water and get the same thing. I probably should read the box more carefully, but on the box it said ""instant & microground coffee"". There's no ground coffee whatsoever. Avoid this, and if you love instant coffee flavor, get a jar, it will be cheaper. I felt cheated."
1,"$15 for ONE pack of Oreos?! You should be ashamed of yourself for taking advantage of people. Do not give your money to these money hungry people!!"
1,"I recently purchased this popcorn and less than half of the popcorn popped.  And those that did pop were tough. I believe these were old.  I've purchased other brands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack.  These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time brand and it popped perfectly.  I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy.  I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!!  What a rip off!!!"
1,"I like spicy candy and wanted to try these.  The box arrived destoyed wrapped only in some plastic. (Like plastic wrap, wrapped around the box a few times) The candy is completely stale, I mean these have to be YEARS old.  They have to be thrown out.  The color is completely faded, they are rock hard, and they have a shrunken look to them.  Don't waste your money on these."
1,"I purchased the pack of five for $23.59. what i got was one pack for 12.99.  when i went back to the site, i clicked on the pack of five and it took me to the page to order, but it didn't have the pack of five highlighted so i got the other.  i should have spotted that, but it was down lower than the screen.  it had the right type of cookie highlighted so i assumed(my favorite word)everything was correct.  this is the first time this has happened.  they need to fix this.  who would buy one package of cookies for almost half the cost of a pack of five."
1,"Someone at work cooked these and the smell is now making everyone sick. Smells kinda like puke. Hopefully the smell does not last overnight. Not recommended."
1,"This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out...I kid you not.  Don't buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap!!!  I deserve a refund for buying this dog food....oh excuse me I forgot even my dog won't eat it :-)"
1,"I don't usually drink energy drinks and I stopped drinking caffeine a little over a year ago, but had a long drive and I was exhausted so decided to give this a try. It worked great for the first 2-3 hours. I had a boost in energy, was more alert and felt fine, but into the 3rd or 4th hour my heart started racing, broke out into a cold sweat and was horribly jittery. When I got home my head started spinning and I couldn't sit down for hours. It was the worst feeling ever. I seriously felt like I was overdosing on a drug. Finally after 7 hours I felt a little better and was finally able to fall asleep, but all into the next day I felt horrible, entire body ached, felt unrested and still jittery. I know not everyone will react the same way, but be careful with this stuff. I did a little research afterwards and found information that suggest it is possible to OD on caffeine and Vitamin B. Maybe the percentages in this drink were just too much for me."
1,"I liked these treats for my dog and he seemed to find them very tasty.  Then I read they were made in China -- given other pet food product issues that originated there, I threw the several bags purchased away."
1,"This was the worst loose tea I have ever had.  I love Stash teabags, English breakfast, but this is bitter and not smooth.save your money"
1,"I have tried other Torani syrups, french vanilla, vanilla, vanilla bean, hazlenut...all of which I liked. This caramel syrup has a strong, chemically aftertaste and smell which can be somewhat diminished if you put it in REALLY strong coffee but even then lingers on very unpleasantly. Amazon was great they sent me out another 3-pack to see if it was just that batch.....Nope. It's definitely something off with this flavor. They refunded my money. I will continue to buy Torani, but not this caramel flavor."
1,"this company is against dog breeders of all kind. In their eyes all breeders are puppy mills... no exceptions!<br />Boycott their products until they wise up!"
1,"I purchased this product awhile back, and tried to use it immediately to prepare for summer bug season.  I had a lot of trouble getting the hose to connect to the sprayer.  It looks like there is a defect in the mechanism involving the sprayer.  Do not purchase this item until it is fixed or the device is changed, it will simply waste your money.  The same device is on several other products, all of which I have had the same issues with.  The sprayer head on the Ortho Weed-be-Gone seems to work the best, however.  I would just remove it and use it on this one, but they are not compatible."
1,"This noodle is not made in Japan, is from Hong Kong, the price in supermarket is about 0,45$ each. Please be a honest seller!!!!"
1,"My entire family of five tried this and we all agree that it is the most disgusting K-cup we have ever tasted."
1,"I didn't actually order this but was sent it by mistake. In searching to see what might have happened, I found it and noticed that the picture doesn't match the description--and I can tell you from what I was sent, it is the description that is correct, not the picture. That is to say, this includes Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade. If when you read this review you see that the picture shows Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade, you can ignore this review--I'm just putting it here to warn people not to be deceived by the picture (I plan to take this review down if the picture is changed to properly reflect what's in the box but there will inevitably be at least a delay in me doing that and perhaps I'll even just forget to do it entirely)."
1,"I bought a 12 pack of the Vita Coco Coconut Water with Acai and Pomegranate 17 oz.  I was not able to even drink the first bottle.  I let several co-workers try it, hoping to GIVE it away.  Six people later....no takers.  Free and no one wanted it.  Do I need to say more?"
1,"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.<br /><br />Very bad form amazon."
1,"I ended up throwing this stuff out, it tasted that bad. Imagine blending grass in a blender until it is liquid and drinking it, that is what this stuff tastes like."
1,"Ok for one the bonsai tree was only 3"" tall you don't get any off the rocks that are in the picture besides 1 rock that is supposes to be the big one but its only the side of a quarter. Very disappointed !!!!"
1,"Don't buy this if you think you're buying organic macaroni and cheese.  I guess I'm more than shocked about how this is fraudulently advertised on Amazon.com.  In its product features, it says: ""Made with organic cheddar cheese.""  This is blatantly false.  When you receive the Mac and Cheese, it's packaged in a neat little ""Back to Nature"" box announcing its support of the Nature Conservancy on the back of the box giving it the veneer of being ""natural.""  However, if you read the ingredients, not even the cheddar cheese is organic.  There is no organic certifier to be found, either.<br /><br />Now, this actually breaks the National Organic Program standards and should be investigated by the Agriculture Department.  This changes my whole view of Kraft -- not that it was especially good before.  But apparently, this company buys into the ""greenwashing"" effort to try to cash in on the good organic name without actually supporting the type of food system we expect when we buy organic."
1,"The price jumped up almost $10 for the 10lb bag. I love my Shih Tzus but it is time to switch to a different brand. I know they will understand that their parents and the country are in financial difficulty. The $10 increase is not acceptable even in the dog world. Too bad because they have been enjoying Royal Canin for six years now. Goodbye Royal Canin."
1,"This is the worst I have ever tasted, makes the vending Machine types taste wonderful. If you want milky flavored water with lots of sweetner then this is for you."
1,"My daughter eats these bars on a daily basis.  I usually purchase these at the local grocery store and thought is would be cost effective to order through Amazon.  My grocery store charges $.99 per bar.  Amazon's price is $1.44 per bar."
1,"I too bought this at Costco and my dog is sick right now.  I am mad at myself for buying these and unhappy with Costco and Amazon for carrying them at all.  DO NOT FEED YOUR DOG!"
1,"Don't waste your money and order directly from Nespresso!  Any Nespresso capsules sold on amazon (by various vendors) are marked WAY up, some by as much as 50%!  Don't be fooled."
1,"I was very excited to find this product, having really enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past and coming to trust them.  I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is disgusting.  The consistency of what comes out of the can is disturbing.  Try to imagine dried out peanut butter that is impossible to separate or spread.  No amount of water that I added would allow me to use a fork (and knife) to try to separate the product and mix it with my dry kibble.<br /><br />Instead, I am trying the new Castor & Pollux Organix Grain Free product, and hoping for the best.<br />[...]"
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5M3Y"">Sadaf Pitted Prunes Black, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />This item was full of mold (fungus) on reciept!"
1,"I gave up the diet coke (aspartame/sucralose)and needed to find something i enjoy drinking. This had great reviews, so i couldn't wait to try it. What a waste of money!! I would rather drink plain water. Not sweet at all. Don't know how i will be able to choke down 23 more packs of this."
1,"This used to be my favorite noodle to eat. But now that it is made without msg, it does not taste the same and I no longer like it :("
1,"I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea."
1,"This item would be ok if it wasn't delivered with 4 days till it was expired. I got it for people at work, not to give in 1 day<br />but what choice did I have, when it expired in 4 days. Oh did I say I got it on a Friday Night and don't go back to work till Monday. So now it's 2 days. No more."
1,"I ordered this item, and was instead shipped a different item (ginger beer).  There is a difference, and the company that makes this makes both.  However, Amazon's warehouses are too stupid to recognize the difference.  When I politely pointed out to them that they had shipped me the wrong item, they very politely apologized, and promised to send me the right item...whereupon they sent me exactly the same wrong item again.  When I complained again, and asked them to either find the right item, or refund my money, they ignored me.  If you really want ginger ale, you can buy this mix on the Internet from other suppliers.  Don't say I didn't warn you."
1,"The product arrived poorly packaged and damaged. Once we got it out of the box, my wife didn't like it all -- it looked cheap. In any event, we made one coffee with it before it completely failed. We sent it back and more than a month later are still waiting for our refund."
1,"Just got a case, and you are right, this is not the same Cheesoning I have used for years. This stuff tastes a little odd to me. I found the last of an old (10 years?) jar and the ingredients are not the same. Salt is the first ingredient for both, but for the old one, cheese powder was #2. For the new jar, cheese powder is #4.<br />Oh well, I have lived long enough to see a lot of good things go bad. This is just one more.<br />As an added insult they made the holes about 5 times bigger than they used to be."
1,"I would gladly review the item, if only I could get it. Thing is that the Einsteins working for Amazon figured that for 27 bucks they would send me one box of pop tarts containing 8 pairs, rather than 8 boxes containing 8 pairs and then to add insult to injury went on to argue with me that the (Pack of 8) in the description means 8 pairs of pop-tarts as opposed to 8 boxes of 16 pop tarts!!!<br />My advise to Amazon - dont quit your day jobs. Stay with the book business!!!"
1,"I truly love the flavor of this soup mix but it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil.  That means it has 'trans fats' that effectively cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease.  That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it.  Soybeans (except for the fermented forms like tempah) elevate one's estrogen levels which can increase the chance of cancer risks...especially estrogen mediated breast cancers.  And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health.  Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.  As much as I love the flavor of this soup mix, I can not recommend it to anyone!  I will not be ordering this health 'time bomb' ever again.  Eat it at your own risk!!!"
1,"This had such high reviews I was expecting much better. I can't describe the consistency except by saying jelly like and not the good kind of jelly. The smell is very fishy and if you wash them you can get rid of most of the smell. However, I do not care for them at all no matter if they are zero calorie."
1,"I selected this company over the other even though the price was higher. I was hoping the pieces would be more consistent in size. It tuened out the container was filled with smaller crum like pieces, worse than the other company's. I will never buy anything from this company."
1,"I received this Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee this weekend; the same brand from the same location I've always gotten it (in fact, its a Subscribe and Save order).  I went to make coffee this morning and almost all the coffee grinds came out of the pod.  I thought it may have been a fluke so I tried 2 more times...both times with the same result.<br />To make sure it wasn't my Keurig I tried a different brand of coffee that I had at home and it worked fine, no coffee grinds at all.<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but this lot of GJ Hazelnut is NOT GOOD!!!"
1,"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!"
1,"The package had 2"" cuts down the center of the bag. The bag was also wrinkly. When I purchase this dog food at local stores the bags never look in bad condition as this one did. Some kibble had come through the cuts and spilled in the amazon packaging box. Not pleased, who knows how sanitary the food is anymore with the bag  broken. Love wellness brand dog food, but not the seller.<br />About wellness small breed- my toy poodle I was told was underweight even with free feed on  eukanuba  but know is a health weight due to the good taste and small kibble size. After disc surgery I soaked his food and he ate on own, big accomplishment for a picky eater who is in post surgery discomfort."
1,"I bought this with high hopes but was very disappointed.  The coffee had a very stale flavor and after brewing, it had a faint odor of cigarette ashes.  I made one cup of this coffee and threw the rest of the k-cups in the trash.  I will never buy this again."
1,"The coffee is delicious.The problem is every time we try to brew it ,it clogs my Cuisinart k-cup brewer.I had the same problem with this brand in decaf.It doesn't happen with any other brand so I know it is the grind of this particular coffee.I will be throwing it out."
1,"These are my least favorite of the Loma Linda products.  Unfortunately, the texture is a bit like modeling clay and the taste is unappealing to me."
1,"The picture shows a Log Cabin label, but I received ""Country Kitchen Original Syrup"".  Very deceiving, not what I expected.  I will not order again."
1,"It's disgusting!! No pumpkin flavor at all!! It tastes like red hot cinnamon candy but way too strong! It came and it looks great but when you taste it you will be disapointed!<br /><br />A rep. called me shortly after I posted this and was very helpful...great customer service!!"
1,"These treats are so hard that I have to take a mallet out on a hard floor with a newspaper to break them up to give to my dog.  I would not buy them again.  My dog is a chewer, but these have no appeal to him unless I break them up first.  And he LOVES duck treats."
1,"Online it says the ingredients are: matcha green tea powder, and sugar.  When I got this in the mail the TRUE ingredients are: green tea, milk, guar gum, nondairy creamer, natural and artificial flavors, salt, and yogurt powder.  Talk about false advertising! Plus the bag it comes in is totally different than the one they show online.  I am a vegan, and I'm highly dissapointed that someone would lie about their product like this."
1,"My child is 2mts old; she is breastfeed and we use some formula (Similac Sensitive and Enfamil Infant). We tried this product today and she hated it! I've never seen her so unhappy!  I tried it (I wanted to check why she didn't like it) and is just not and sweet as formula or human milk.<br />I gave this product one star although I understand that it is only my child opinion, and in general this product is probably really good."
1,"What a disgusting flavor, I have never tasted anything worse. it was so bad i poured in into the toilet."
1,"This bone is nothing more than a very expensive dog biscuit. My dog consumed the entire thing in less than 20 minutes. He really enjoyed it, but there is no way I'm going to buy another one. There are a lot of  more durable bones that cost the same or less than this one. I do not recommend it at all.<br /><br />My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this ""Edible"" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one."
1,"Don't waste your money, even more importantly, your time. They leak badly, don't seal so water just shoots through the cup not giving any time for coffee to brew. Grounds in the coffee. A Terrible waste of time and money.<br /><br />Go back to EZ filters."
1,"I loved the idea of these lollipops, since we have had some big problems with my 5-year old and tooth decay.  She has a crown on one tooth, and the lollipop instantly stuck to the crown, with a very upset child!  I used some water to extract the lollipop, but we will not be using these again.  They may be suitable for kids without crowns, but I imagine they will still be very sticky to teeth."
1,"I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However, none of my three dogs had any interest in them, even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer, one is a medium chewer, and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also, it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck.  I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat.  I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle, for nothing...<br />  Sorry for the bad review....The review is from the dogs, and not me!  I paid quite a bit for 2 of them, and I<br />need to figure out what to do with them...paid too much to throw them away.. maybe make a bird feeder?"
1,"My husband loves LifeSavers and even though my daughter thought orange mints sounded disgusting I thought these sounded pretty good. There were only six reviews,but since they were all five stars I decided to order the pack of 12 Orange Mint LifeSavers.  Big mistake!  My daughter put it best when she said they taste like orange medicine.  Also, why do these contain Aspartame?  They aren't sugar free.<br /><br />If you've tasted these and love them, then you should buy them.<br /><br />Definitely try these before you buy a pack of 12."
1,"I became a vegetarian about three years ago, and before that, Teriyaki was my favorite flavor of beef jerky. So when I saw this, I immediately bought it. However, this was NOTHING like jerky. It was squishy, and tasted like bread, and the supposed ""Teriyaki"" flavor was nothing like any Teriyaki flavor I've ever had. No one in my house will eat it, so I'm returning it. If you buy, I guarantee you'll be sorry."
1,"These treats arrive so broken & crushed, they are worthless.  Not ONE unbroken treat in the entire bag!  Crumbs & pieces are all you receive."
1,"I tried this new flavor in our area yesterday, and the first few sips were good, so I put it on ice in a glass, and by the time I finished it, my tongue had this hot burning sensation which lasted for 6 hours....I'll never buy this particular tea again, and I also advised Snapple of it, so it will be interesting to see if they replace it or not....Has anyone else experienced the same taste discomfort?"
1,"Mocha Jive(a), not Mocha Java. No smell, no taste. no hint of Mocha. Barely any taste of Java either! It is brown so I gave it 1 star."
1,"I agree with other viewers on the ""good tasting"" but why so expensive? $8.48 per package seem way too much, even for generally high priced GF products.  Whole Foods sells for $3.99 per package."
1,"Just as in one of the previous reviews, my dog (wheaten terrier) had severe liquid diarrhea a few hours after eating the Rachel Ray Nutrish Soup Bone product.  He ran outside as quickly as possible to ""go"" and seemed very embarrassed and panicked. After the ""explosions"" and him trying to scoot all over the grass, he was drooling and panting more than normal and curled up in a ball at the bottom of the basement steps, after which, he went straight in his kennel. Poor thing! I normally feed my dog Go! and Now! all natural and/or grain free dog foods, made in Canada and sold at an independent pet supply shop. Apparently, they are well worth the price.  Never again will I make an impulse treat purchase on a rare trip to Wal-Mart. I hope he recovers quickly and allows me to clean his bottom. Eeek! I blame Oprah. I bet she wouldn't feed her cocker spaniels this crap!"
1,"This was not the original twizzlers, This one had the hershey chocolate logo on it. the original brand of years before did not. The picture was not big enough."
1,"Someone has given me a box of the assorted chocolates.<br />Do any of you ever read the ingredients?<br />An absolutely horrible stuff.<br />Wouldn't you expect for the Monks to make their own product<br />that is not only delicious but also free of all the carcinogenic coloring,high fructose corn syrup etc..etc.. etc..I wonder where on Earth are they getting all these ingredients?"
1,"Has a nice mellower taste than store bought heat-processed table salt.<br /><br />No Iodine, so I supplement with 4 drops of good tasting Liquid Dulse <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014HV48"">Bernard Jensen Products - Liquid Dulse, 4 oz liquid</a> (also Very good to FILL thyroid with GOOD iodine!- Keeps from taking in any Radioactive iodine from Japan reactor spill!- Radioactive iodine does Permanent damage to thyroid, and can't be reversed! Radioactivity is sure to work into our food supply...!)<br /><br />Per my dentist (for everyone)- I started gargling with 1/4tsp salt in 8oz of water after brushing.<br />It is VERY unnerving to see the undissolved black/brown specs floating around!<br /><br />The other unprocessed sea salt brands come from ""Less"" pristine waters, but I'll give them a try next time."
1,"I have Crohn's and can not eat anything with sugar. These have sugar though it is not listed here as an ingredient. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE ON SCD."
1,"I stock my shelves with Iced Cafe Mocha for unknown reasons any pack with an August 2013 expiry tastes like chalkly chocolate and the texture is thicker. I am trying to return my recent purchases. It is so frustrating. I really miss the original Iced Cafe Mocha. It was perfectly sweetened, tastes like real mocha and very satifying. Oh and it smells like mocha from Starbucks..yummmmm<br /><br />I'm going to whole foods to check if they have the older ones (expiring June 2013)."
1,"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!"
1,"THIS WAS AEWFUL TASTED TERRIBLE AFTER A FEW SIPS I COULDN'T GIVE THE SODA AWAY TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WORKING AT A NEARBY HOME."
1,"Bought a big bag to save $$.. never again.<br /><br /> This stuff is soooooo dusty. My poor cat was sneezing like crazy. And i love perfume but this stuff was  so over the top in smell that even I didnt like it.<br /><br /> And I am the kind of person who people tease because I can never pass a perfume counter without testing everything.<br /><br />Do yourself and your cat a favor and get the expensive but recycled and biodegradable litter that is made from corn. I love that stuff. No dust and it absorbs all the odors."
1,"In my very unscientific personal research in my home, I had this experience:<br />After reading pros and cons of both ProPest and Safer Brands for clothes moth capture, I wasn't sure which one would work best, so:  I ordered both, and put one of each in all of the rooms where I suspected moths.<br />Day 1:  Pro-Pest had a moth in each trap; Safer had none<br />Day 2:  Pro-Pest 10 v. Safer had 1<br />We are now on Day 14, and some of the Safer traps still have zero moths, while the ProPest continues to capture them.  I tried switching them around, and to see if somehow positioning gave an edge, and nope:  the Pro-Pest gets them where the Safer Brand does not.  I'm a believer and about to order more packs of the Pro-Pest!"
1,"I ordered this for my Senseo just for something new. I usually use the Senseo Sumatran pods. My normal serve is two pods with the double cup serve. I thought from reading this that I could use ONE pod for a double cup. Apparently that is incorrect. Okay, that's on me. I tried a pod on a single cup. Couldn't really discern any difference from the first. Very weak. I am not a ""coffee afficiando"" but I thought this coffee sucked."
1,"I tried writing a review previously but I focused on how recieving a bottle w a busted cap and dents on my product didnt make me super happy. I wasnt going to have a container once I took off the foil cause the cap was busted...so I got a plastic container and dumped syrup in there for storage. Tonight,  I made a mint julep w the syrup. Its wasnt a HORRIBLE drink, but its not a mint julep to me. It just didnt taste like the ones Ive had. Taste combined w a shabby bottle didnt work for me."
1,"I was hoping for a ecological solution to the plastic garbage bags used in our community and decided to try these bags, even though they cost nearly 6 times more than Costco's conventional plastic bags. Sorry but these bags are not the solution. They are not only too thin for the job, but also not large enough for the average garbage can, and lack a convenient way to secure them. Admittedly, perhaps if you only fill them half full you probably could make them work, but then you are making twice as many trips to your main garbage can and the price differential increases to NEARLY 12 TIMES THE COST OF A CONVENTIONAL BAG. You are never going to convince many people to be more environmentally friendly with this product."
1,"product is advertised as box candies but are delivered into cheap plastic bags ( not the fancy candy bags ) and broken as CRUMBS instead of impeccable hard candies.<br />That ruined my Holiday Party as i had intended to use use for stuffings. Had to rush to the local candy store and get others.<br />At $9.99 a pound, i call that a scam."
1,"I would love to buy tis, but there is no information about it, and $54 is a lot to spend on a pig in a poke.  How many and what size bottles are there in this ""case""?"
1,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price."
1,"The Licorice spice tea is fragrant and delicious.<br />I was given some to try, and was so excited about this tea. I added it to my amazon.com<br />subscriptions. Several days later I mentioned this tea to my Doctor. He gave me a<br />strict warning against ANY kind od black Licorice.<br />This tea and all black licorice products need clearly posted warnings.<br />Not for consumption by anyone with high Blood pressure, or on blood pressure medicines.<br />The package had not yet arrived, I contacted amazon for return instructions and was told it is not return or refundable!  Very unhappy  :(<br />Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
1,"I bought this from Amazon (not the seller depicted currently). The plant looked great on arrival, but it died with 15 days, despite trying very hard and following all instructions. I wonder if shipping in a box (and depriving light, etc for 2-4 days) causes such damage."
1,"This is the first time I had the opportunity to experience Taste Nirvana's Real Coconut Water and I must say what a disappointment. This has to be absolutely one of the worst products that is being marketed as Real Coconut Water. The very first thing I noticed when I opened the can was a chemical odor coming from the coconut water. This was the first indication that I knew I would not enjoy this product and probably was a waste of money. The second issue I had with this product was the taste was way off when compared to real coconut water actually comes from the tree.<br /><br />This product is a real waste...Zico, One and Vita Coco are way better products."
1,"First saw this item while in Hawaii. Item is not available via Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, or any other local retail distributor.<br />The only circumstances under which I would reorder is if the price is brought in line to alternatives, for example, the equivalent amount of flavored Crystal Geyser which sells 24 x 18 Fluid Ounces for $8.00. Do the math. The price required by the Amazon selection is absolutely outrageous, and doesn't include shipping. I cannot recommend this produce in good conscience as it outrageously overpriced."
1,"To any buyer out there!!!<br />Please go to Nespresso directly and pay $5 per sleeve (each sleeve contains 10 capsules)<br />Why they think to charge that much is an absolute craziness.<br /><br />Please take this product off Amazon.com<br />I have never thought anyone should worry about being ripped off on Amazon.com<br /><br />This makes me very sad."
1,"I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee."
1,"Not only did the K-cup explode, after i strained the coffee, when i tasted it, it tasted like the water in my universities salinated pool."
1,"I recently ran low on Castor & Pollux Organix Adult Less Active Canine Formula Dry Dog Food and it was unavailable with Prime shipping at the time, so I ordered this brand.  I've been mixing the two together to increase my dog's acceptance, but she now has not eaten for three days straight.  I suppose that is an alternate strategy for weight reduction, but neither of us is happy, and the food was really expensive.  My dog does not recommend this dog food. She preferred the Organix."
1,"The jars exploded in the box; when I opened the box it was an absolute mess.  I have NEVER left negative feedback for an item before, but this one certainly warranted it.  I tried to return it to Amazon, but was told that it was not eligible for a return; never shall I order perishable items from Amazon again.."
1,"The item description and content sounded great.  Once we got it, the taste was terrible.  Tastes like acetone."
1,"I bought three bags (variety) of this treat.  It had no smell.  My dog would not eat any of them.  It obviously had no taste either."
1,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.  I received a case of boxes of broken little spaghetti bits.  It has been very frustrating trying to cook individual portions or anything less than a full box because of the uneven fragments and the way they mix together - you also end up with tons of tiny little pieces all over the place.  TERRIBLE."
1,"I had heard about this product on the local news and decided to try this product. It was the worse product I have ever eaten.  I could not finish it and I am stuck with another bag of this item.  I would not recommend this product to anyone. It also took a long time to arrive..........."
1,"I bought these because I saw other ratings, and I wish that I just stuck with the Kettle chips I knew I loved.  Now I have 35 bags left and don't know what to do with them.<br /><br />Taste was almost buttery... rather than salt and vinegar."
1,"So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame."
1,"Bahlsen Delice Cookies, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)<br />Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing, there is NO mention of eggs and when i received the product, on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is EGG."
1,"I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs.  One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys.  I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided.  On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them.  In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls.  By three hours there were no treats left in either of them.  Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too.  The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room.  I wouldn't recommend this product due to the high price tag, and the fact that it just doesn't deliver on it's name."
1,"$90 for 24 bottles? That's 3.75 a bottle. Amazon needs to rethink what kind of pricing they allow on their site...."
1,"I've read the reviews and I agree that Yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $100 for 12 cans comes to over $8 a can.  That's $3 more a can than I pay at my local store.  I don't understand the high price?"
1,"Our black lab devoured this thing in 10 minutes, and at $6 a pop, that's way too much money for a dog treat.  Don't bother getting this."
1,"I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.  The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right.  First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey.  I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!"
1,"Since the product hasnt been delivered I cant review it.  The only thing I am not happy about is the delivery charge was more than the product."
1,"I was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the Keurig coffe maker that I received for Xmas.  I am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course I wanted to have the same great coffee thru the Keurig machine.  The mesh filter that I bought first left a slimed residue in the brew....so I believed that the paper filter you created would do the job....well it does it's work properly but it is a little large for the Keurig device....so water and grinds sort of go everywhere.......I dont think your product isnt good ...the whole Keurig experience is a great disappointment!"
1,"I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!"
1,"I was so disappointed when Amazon stopped carrying the black tea version of this Blueberry iced tea. When I found the green tea version, I quickly ordered another case. Boy am I unhappy. The green tea version has no flavor - no matter how many bags I use to make a pitcher. If you are looking for blueberry flavor - skip this one. Now I have a cupboard of tinted water bags!"
1,"I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.  Consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients."
1,"Received this yesterday, and today, everyone in my family tried it.  It tasted REALLY awful.  I would never, ever buy this product again.  I'm honestly shocked it has so many good reviews.  I don't know if we got a bad batch or what, but it was downright disgusting.  I couldn't even drink half of it before dumping it out."
1,"I ordered this Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil last year and found it to be quite good.  It had a nice ""olivey"" flavor and I felt safe ordering it again this year.  Unfortunatly this can has none of that ""olivey"" flavor.  In fact it is flavorless! I am very disappointed and will probably not order it again.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MMO8W2"">Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 1 Gallon</a><br /><br />Sincerely;<br />E. Carlson"
1,"This wafer is in very cute package. However, in my opinion, it contains few cream inside and could not feel it tasty. If combined with champagne, the taste became better but not very good. As I may give this as a gift to couple or family including non-drinker, I wanted this wafaer taste good without champagne."
1,"Although the expiration date on the bars I got is still 8 months away, the bars are stale. The flavor seems okay (at first), but it also makes it clear that there are no berries in this product. The only fruits in the ingredient list are cherries, and raspberry *juice*. It also leaves a bitter after-taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I was hoping for better, but I was very disappointed."
1,"I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee."
1,"After several months and much wasted milk I've given up on these grains. I'm pretty experienced with kefir making. I've bought kefir grains before, but always live, never dried. I followed the reviving directions exactly, but the resulting kefir smelled and tasted foul, there was always too much moldy ""flowers of kefir"" after just one or two days, and there was never any kefirian."
1,"I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic."
1,"After reviewing the ingredients I immediately threw away this product.<br />The research that has been done on corn syrup indicates not only is it a big factor in the obesity area, but very hard on digestion - affecting the kidneys!!!  All Americans should be eliminating this from their<br />diets immediately.  I am on a campaign to hopefully have that happen.<br />Lets us the corn for feed and ethonol.  There is no nutritional value in corn!!!"
1,"The aroma of the Hartz Smoked Pork Bone is just downright memorizing-even tempting the taste buds of humans. That's about the extent of the reasons I like this product. This splinters BADLY!! My 75 lb Dalmatian ate one last night @10pm and today @ 5pm he vomited shards of the bone (which was a lot) and everything else he ate that couldn't pass as a result of these bone fragments blocking the passageway of his intestines. Please do not purchase these bones for your dog! If you care enough about them; then find something else!"
1,"I used the small cup size, and it tasted like a watery cup of chemicals with a hint of chocolate flavor. Yuk."
1,"Tastes like melted plastic.  I will not buy this ever again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.  Ick!"
1,"The instructions for this meal indicate you should empty the noodles into the box, and break them apart with a fork.  I did that.  Then it tells you to add the sauce (this doesn't taste anything like teriyaki sauce), and microwave it for 2 minutes.<br /><br />I followed the instructions, and when I opened the box, I got a clumped up noodle meal with poor taste.  I threw half of it away.  Out of all the microwave and frozen meals I eat, this one rates as one of my lowest."
1,"I did not like this coffee. It is on the light side. It has too much acid or something, I felt almost ill after drinking it.  I shared it with a co-worker and he felt the same way.  I am a big coffee drinker and usually can drink very strong coffee And never have stomach upsets but do with this blend."
1,"For everyone on here that says your dogs love it, there is reason they do. It contains sugar and sorbitol (another sweetener). I like Kruspy Kreme donuts...but I wouldn't eat them everyday. If I did, I'd turn out like my dogs who ate beneful....riddled with diabetes and other health problems. Try to imagine the pain of seeing your dogs go blind and eventully have their lives shortened. After finding out (too late) what was in beneful, I have no doubt that it was behind their health problems. I have yet to come across a single other dog food, even other poor quality ones, that have sugar. You are playing russian roulette with your dog's life if you feed them beneful. Trust me. If you have had similar experiences, I'd like to hear from you. Contact me at [...]"
1,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I got suckered in by all the 5 star reviews and took a chance on this massively overpriced coffee.  The coffee itself is average at best, nothing really distinguishing about it.  It's fine as a daily drinker but doesn't really work as an espresso and certainly isn't worth the massive premium charged.<br /><br />I have since looked at all the 5 star reviews more carefully and it appears that many reviewers have not reviewed any other products (classic sign that the seller is the one doing the ""reviewing"").<br /><br />Needless to say I won't be making the same mistake twice, there are many better coffees out there at a fraction of the price.  I hope this helps others from making the same mistake I did."
1,"I ordered the Get Well Soon Chicken Soup Tote - Gourmet Food Gift basket to be delivered to my sister following her surgery.  I asked for her comments on the gift; she said that many of the items were stale.  It was cute, but I will not order this item again.<br />I wrote to the supplier about this and never received a reply of any kind.<br />I tried to find something different, but this one is not worth it."
1,"I love a good cup of hot cocoa now and then.  However, this product tastes awful!  My Keurig machine has two cups sizes and even on the smaller size the hot cocoa tastes very watered down.  We have to brew a k cup AND add half a packet of regular hot cocoa to make it drinkable!  I think that this is unacceptable especially since these cups cost more than the coffee ones.  We are gradually using our pack up, but WILL NEVER buy this product again!"
1,"Poor Charlie...<br /><br />Hard to get the phrase ""New Coke"" out of my head.<br />I always bought Lindt because of their quality and consistency. Very, very Swiss.<br /><br />I have been enjoying this chocolate bar for the past twenty years in Europe and the USA.<br />We just finished our old stash of Lindt Excellence 70% dark chocolate bars. I went to the store for more and noticed on the outside of the bar the words, ""NEW RECIPE."" It should say, ""RUINED PRODUCT.""<br /><br />The bar has what appears to be a lighter color, less snap and definitely less depth and body of cacao. The great flavor is gone. Now the chocolate liquor that used to slowly melt off the back of the tongue, flowing down your throat is replaced by a thick wax that reminds me of Hershey.<br /><br />On the back it says:<br />""EXCELLENCE 70% COCOA is characterized by a warm brown hue and a light fragrance of cacao. Experience this new milder recipe the balances smooth dark chocolate flavor with a surprisingly rich and creamy texture.""<br /><br />MANUFACTURED BY:<br />LINDT & SPRUNGLI (USA) INC.,<br />STRATHAM,NH 03885<br /><br />the old bar said:<br /><br />Manufactured  by:<br />LINDT & SPRUNGLI SAS (France)<br />DISTRIBUTED BY:<br />LINDT & SPRUNGLI (USA) INC.,<br />STRATHAM,NH 03885"
1,"This is basically misleading advertising. They label it pure, but have a genetically modified ingredient within. Maltodextrin is genetically modified corn sugar. GMO corn is one of the worst things you can put into your body according to my research, along with Canola Oil(no matter how they claim it's healthy), Aspartame, high fructose corn syrum, and other hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />Shame on them for labeling this ""Pure"". You got my $10, but I will never buy their products again"
1,"Noticed the reviews about the change in formula. What bad practice...<br /><br />I did start noticing that my LO has been acting different and that mixing the formula kept leaving lumps. I'm guessing you can blame the added glucose syrups along with my S&S has been going up in price. From 82 to 97 dollars. I hate feeling taking advantage of just because I want the best for my LO. Shame on them for a shitty practice.<br /><br />BTW:<br /><br />Slighty same nutritional value as Walmart's Parent's Choice Organic Formula. Only difference I saw was a slightly higher calcium. I didn't go through the list one by one in ingredient but it is safe to say that they all come from the same manufacture. I will grab a can to find out.<br /><br />$62 dollars for a 4 pack compared to $97."
1,"These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead."
1,"Just like some of the other posts, its made me and my 3 yr old daughter very sick. I cant handle small amounts of gluten. Were 100% gluten free. We ate these for our bedtime snack and both of us felt so bad in the morning we went back to bed and slept 2 1/2 hours and had all the other symptoms of eating a large amount of gluten! the chocolate cake from Betty CRocker did the same thing!<br />General mills cereals that says GF do the same thing to us! Beware! Make your brownies from scratch!"
1,"This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.  It will make your cats fat and lazy.  My friend's cat was vomiting and had been to every vet and had every test but when she switched the food to Innova Evo, the cat stopped vomiting.  Do not buy this food because for the same price you can buy Evo which is grain free and made with table-grade meat. SCIENCE DIET IS GARBAGE!"
1,"I like munchies.<br />I like bite-sized snacks.<br />I like cookie dough items.<br />I even like peanut butter.<br /><br />But, these things should be stripped of their name!<br />They are like regular malted milk ball size, very soft (which is good), but the flavor sort of<br />defies description.  They don't taste like chocolate balls, don't taste like peanut butter (although<br />they are the color of peanut butter on the inside), and don't taste like cookie dough.<br /><br />All in all, pretty junky, even for junk food!<br />Don't bother with these at all. Four of us tried it and none of us liked them.<br />The rest of the box went into the trash, which was the best thing about them.<br />Seriously - why does the manufacturer even bother to make these?  : P"
1,"I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center, thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods."
1,"This is one of the grossest things I've ever eaten. I took one bite and threw the entire thing away. Don't waste your money! The entire thing tasted like melted plastic."
1,"Being a gluten sensitive individual, I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.<br /><br />Because I didn't first do my homework, and read the labels before I began consuming these, I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities/allergies to avoid this product."
1,"I have thought about ordering this product for 2 years and finally did.<br />I had 11 inches of my colon removed 3 years ago due to diverticulosis.  I LOVE popcorn, but since my surgery I had been advised to not eat it, or eat it rarely due to the hulls.  I was NEVER more excited after I ordered this product.<br /><br />What I can honestly tell you is this products has is the same amount of hulls as the popcorn I buy at the grocery store for 1/4 the price.  The small white popcorn is tender, but the hulls are still there in high volume.  So I will NOT be eating it.<br /><br />Order at your own discretion."
1,"worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.  gave it to the birds for bird food.  postage was outrageous!  just not a good experience all around.  wont be buying from them ever again."
1,"This item is a PDQ try item per amazon, and has 8 bags in each tray. I place order received 1 bag, contacted amazon and I said if it was actually suppose to be 8 bags I would like a replacement, they issued a replacement and I received 1 bag again. They told me to keep 1st bag so now with 2 bags I got my moneys worth. Beware description is wrong, regular price at walmart is a little over 3 per bag.<br /><br />On a better note, dingoroos are the only treat my dog will eat, glad to see dingo brought them back."
1,"This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.  If you look elsewhere on the Interned, you can find a MUCH better price.  I just placed an order for the same product with iHerb.com.  A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free."
1,"Have to disagree with the previous rating. This product is supposed to be a natural white creamy color and not dark brown last time I checked? Taste was bitter and had lumps of an ingredient in the bottle my guess is a ""cloud"" mixture that is not properly formulated"
1,"I got this in a variety back, and this flavor was my least favorite.  I can't describe what it tastes like, but it is not chocolate or donut."
1,"My wife and I started a tradition years ago where we would make Boboli pizza's and rent a movie every weekend.  The boboli crusts that used to be so good have progressively become worse and worse the last couple of years.  What used to be a thick but light crust with lots of cheese on it has become a blob of almost uncooked dough with only a couple specks of cheese.  They seem to keep changing the recipe and each time it gets worse.  It's definitely time for a new tradition!!!"

1,"Where is the quality control with AMAZON's grocery items?!! Half of the cans I received were SEVERELY DENTED. The product looked like it belonged on a 75% clearance rack at my local market. This is simply appalling and really disappointing. I had intially signed up for the automatic delivery subscription for this item but have since cancelled it if this is indicative of the product Amazon will be sending."
1,"If you want the syptoms of the flu, like severe gas, stomache ache, stomache gurgling, having the runs every 10 minutes, then this is the product for you. You will feel like you are making part two of Dumb and Dumber, when Jeff Daniels sat on the toilet making severe gas and splashing noises after being fed laxitves. Only you can't stop when the scene is over, this will last two to three days."
1,"This product is a complete waste of money. I am a long distance motorcycle rider (1500 plus miles in 24 hours)and bought this product for a quick and lasting energy boost. I read the good reviews and bought a case. Form the first bottle to the last I couldn't tell any difference after taking it.It was as effective as drinking a glass of water. If you still want to try it only buy one to try and don/t waste your money on a case."
1,"This item arrived in an inedible condition.  I chilled it, and open opening the jar I found the top layer had dried and congealed to the point where it was like a sort of low viscosity gummy candy substance.  I couldn't dig anything out with a spoon.  It was horrible.  Both jars were like this.<br /><br />Amazon provided a refund with no return immediately, so you're protected if you want to give it a shot.  Maybe it was a bad batch for me."
1,"They have lost it. I recently bought some and the greedy BS's have added artificial flavor, and it just didn't taste the same. I used to be a See's buyer, but no longer! Goodness knows what they have done to the rest of the products!!!"
1,"I am a little disappointed that I have to drink 5 pounds of this stuff. It's not completely undrinkable, but it is very bland. I will not be ordering this again."
1,"I bought this product believing it to be a healthy product.  While it may be healthy, the salt does not dissolve--or maybe it's sand others have referred to.  Eating a casserole or pasta dish with this salt is horrible--it ruined the dishes because it was so gritty.  I prefer not to feel like I am chewing something that sand was sprinkled on.  The salt (or sand?) does NOT dissolve in meals where it's added & cooked with the meal."
1,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1,"Sent wrong product. I ordered Ham and Bean soup, and they sent Chili Beans. Horrible experience.  Now, I suppose the burden is on me. They should send me a new box of the CORRECT product."
1,"I have Keurig at works and I drank variety of brewers all the time.  Finally decide to buy a unit at home for myself.  Amazon sales it in a bundle and it looks like a good deal, so I bought the samplers.  It is unfortunately a wrong thing to do.  I don't know whether it is due to the pressure during the shipments, several cups lose their tight seal upon arrival.  We didn't notice until we put it in the unit and some of the coffee grounds leaked it into the cup.  I also notice some sampler tasted stale.  Perhaps it is from the shipper, but it is bad.  You will be better off just go to Publics, Target, or Beals to buy them fresh.<br />About a third of the items on this 35 different sampler amount to either lose sealed or bad taste items.  I don't know if it is even possible to ask for a refund?  Does it worth my time and postage to mail them back??"
1,"Some caused gastrointestinal disturbances.<br />Some cans may have only a few pear slices: Some cans may have many.<br />I discovered the discrepancy too late to return to amazon.com<br />Suspected recalled product but can find no evidence.<br />Bought halves and slices of pears: discovered fruit cocktail in one can labeled pears.<br /><br />Beware."
1,"I don't know why you are asking for a review.  I sent an email regarding the shipment and included a photo of the box a few weeks ago after the shipment arrived. No one has responded.  The shipment came and all eight of the jars were not sealed and leaked out in the box.  I did not refuse the box because I didn't want to wait for another shippment.  Now I wish I had returned it."
1,"After reading the ingredients, I can't drink this tea.  I do love tea, but these ingredients sound a bit too harsh for me.  Also, I read some bad things about this tea when reading the reviews.  I refuse to drink this tea.  I am a bit on the sensitive side, and I get reactions from most things that I cannot pronounce or have never heard of.  I will stick with the natural tea that I've been drinking.  I am a tea-drinker, but not this tea.<br /><br />Also, I couldn't drink this tea anyway, even if I wanted to, because the product was all over the outside of the bottle when I took it out of the mailer.  The packaging of this product must not be very good; it seems to have leaked through."
2,"The cookies taste like the cake snack called Devil Dogs.  They're very dry.  It's probably what chocolate dirt sprinkled with chocolate chips would taste like.  If you like Devil Dogs then you'll probably like these cookies."
2,"I was shocked at how small the boxes of jelly beans were.  The only positive to this product was the excitement on my son's face when he opened it.  The flavors are really gross and my son only ate 2."
2,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."
2,"Question:  Are the larger (27.7 oz.) cans of the Nestle Rich Milk Chocolate cocoa mix (39 servings) no longer available??  The texture and taste of the cocoa in the smaller cans is nowhere near as good as the cocoa we have previously ordered.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Vernon Aune"
2,"The package says that this pasta is gnocchi, but it's actually just whole wheat pasta in the shape of shells."
2,"Being in Afghanistan - Dr. Pepper is hard to come by. I always have Dr. Pepper within arm's reach back at home. Here... not so much... So I went on a Dr. Pepper search. $50 shipping for 24/pk cans... That was not happening, but I bought other things with the goodness of DP flavor... icy pops(yummy btw)and the jerky. The jerky is just jerky... There might be a hint of DP flavor, but it's so light that my mind might be playing tricks on me wishing to taste it so badly.<br /><br />Also. it IS ONLY 4oz! just like the title says! that's $5/oz... I read the title then I saw the picture with three packages a little deceiving in my opinion I figured for $20 I was getting three 4oz packages. As far the other review saying the jerky is dry... It's jerky...<br /><br />It is not bad jerky but it doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper, and it is definitely not worth $5/oz. IMHO... live and learn but the DP icy pops are pretty good :)"
2,"All of the cans were dented and the artichokes are not tender.  I wont purchase again.  The tiny artichokes are so much better."
2,"I really wish Amazon would list ingredients for the food products they sell, whether it's for human or animal consumption.  For some reason I assumed Greenies were natural and it's completely my fault for not looking for the ingredients on another site before buying, but yeah... these are corn-based and thus not very different from the junk you can get in the supermarket.  Oh, except these cost more.  So why should I buy them??  Sure my cat likes them but she seems to like 95% of the treats I give her, plus simply liking them doesn't make them good/healthy for her - much like inhaling a box of Cheez-Its is deliciously naughty for me.<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients in the salmon Greenies for anyone who cares:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brewers Rice, Ground Wheat, Corn Gluten Meal, Poultry Fat (Preserved With Mixed Tocopherols), Sprayed Dried Hydrolyzed Chicken Protein Concentrate, Oat Fiber, Salmon Meal, Natural Chicken Flavor, Vegetable Oil (Preserved With Mixed Tocopherols), Natural Poultry and Fish Flavor, Sodium Gluconate, Brewer's Dried Yeast, Calcium Carbonate, Potassium Chloride, Glucono-delta-lactone, Citric Acid, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Vitamins: [Vitamin A Supplement, D-Activated Animal Sterol (Source of Vitamin D3 Supplement), dl-Alpha Tocopherol Acetate (Source of Vitamin E), Niacin Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Riboflavin Supplement, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K Activity), Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement], Minerals: [Zinc Proteinate; Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Iron Sulfate, Sodium Selenite, Cobalt Carbonate, Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide], Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary Extract, DL Methionine, Chlorophyll."
2,"So after buying some good choices for coffee and even liking the english breakfast tea selection, I thought it would be nice to have some hot cocoa available in case company/friends didn't want coffee when visiting.  The delivery of the product is somewhat messy.  The syrup seems to make the machine struggle a bit and is dispensed in a haphazard fashion into your mug.  You do have to clean up after using this product as well as running the cleaning disk as it really shouldn't sit in the tube very long.  But all that would of been forgiven for a half-way decent tasting product.  Well sadly, the people at the test kitchen left early that day as a lot leaves to be desired for the taste of this product.  It really does taste worse then the bag versions of hot cocoa.  I am not sure how that is possible using milk and syrup, but it does.  It has terrible after taste which reminds me of using inferior sugar substitutes.  I don't hate it, just don't like it.  I will finish the product and not buy again, but wife won't touch it again.  Even if you really want to try it or think its good just to have on hand -- I wouldn't recommend at all.  I don't mind the product only making half a mug if it was only worth it.  I attached product photo as it looks promising once its made.  But that's all."
2,"The two star rating is not for the product.  I have not seen my new cat choke up a hairball using thia product, and he seems to like it, so as a product review, I would have given it 5 stars.  The two stars is for the instant price increase after I bought this product using Amazon's Subscribe And Save.  When I purchaed it, the subscription price was 8.97.  Right after I received the first package, the price jumped to 11.82.  The one time delivery price is 12.44.  That's an increase of 2.85!  Wal-Mart's price is 10.98.  Granted, adding tax makes the price almost, but not quite the same, but then you have to wait for delivery.  This is one of the very few time I've ever been disappointed in Amazon,"
2,"I Like the ThinkThin products and had good luck with a shipment of the peanut butter ones, but these brownie crunch ones arrived in poor condition. From my best guess it looks like they were stored someplace that was hot enough for their chocolate coating to melt. Each one is splotched with white, the chocolate is brittle and flakes off immediately and bears imprints of the outer wrapper, exactly as if they had melted and then re-solidified. They need to be stored someplace much cooler. They tasted fine, but were a huge mess and very unappealing to look at."
2,"THIS SNACK IS ""OK""...2 OR 3 STARS... FIRST, THESE ARE INDEED JUNK FOOD...ONE THIRD CALORIES FROM FAT, HIGH GLYCEMIC CARBS, 1 GRAM FIBER, 2 GRAMS PROTEIN. SECOND, THE CHEESE FLAVOR IS MILDER THAN THE ""AGED WHITE CHEDDAR"" LED ME TO BELIEVE. THE TEXTURE WAS THAT OF VERY SOFT STYROFOAM PACKING PEANUTS. SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE! IF SOMEONE OFFERED ME SOME AT THE MOVIES OR NEXT TO A SANDWICH...OK, SURE...BUT THE GUSHING PRAISE I READ HERE LED ME TO PURCHASE A 12 BAG CASE WHILE THEY WERE ON SALE...I WILL BE SHARING THESE FREELY...NO TEMPTATION TO HOARD THEM. THEY'RE JUST ""OK"" ...IF I COULD GIVE A BAG TO THE BIG FANS, IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE."
2,"I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that."
2,"I have purchased the Organic coconut milk many times.  It has a fresh, coconut taste and is very smooth.  But, it has guar gum added.  I decided to give the regular Natural Value a try (non-organic, no guar gum).  It is a very different product.  The coconut milk has a strange smell and flavor.  It is unpleasant and does not taste like coconut.  The can contains a lot of liquid and the coconut solid is somewhat grainy in texture compared to the organic.  Overall, I am unhappy with this product.  I cannot recommend it."
2,"I am a big fan of Dave's Gourmet sauces and condiments, but not this one.  If I was just rating it as a mustard alone I would give it 3 stars for taste, 1 for value.  There are much better, brighter and fresher tasting mustards available at half the cost of this one.<br /><br />However, this is a Dave's Gourmet product and as such I am looking for not just a good mustard but but one that makes a good use of a variety of heat producing, tongue scorching peppers, like Serrano or maybe even Habanero.  What we get instead is a mediocre Dijon-style mustard spiced up with ""hot pepper extract"".  This is a commercial additive of pure (or close to pure) capsicum, which is used for riot control and to add heat to an otherwise bland product.  In my humble opinion hot pepper extract adds ""hotness"" without adding to the flavor.  Dave's has some great products, I just don't think that this is one of them."
2,"Over the years, I have been served honey in packets and cups at diners and restaurants many, many times, just as have most Americans. I've enjoyed it in tea, on biscuits, and on yummy sopaipillas. Honey really seems to bring out the wonderful flavor of good buttermilk biscuits and sopaipillas. (And if you've never had sopaipillas, RUN, don't walk to the Great Southwest and try them. They make your eyes roll back they are so good) ... but I digress.<br /><br />The key to honey on these great American foods is that it has to be a delicate flavored honey to complement rather than overpower them...which is what I have always experienced with these little single-serve packets of honey ... a lovely golden liquid that melts in your mouth, and is chosen for its mild flavor for exactly the use I have described. But, to put it in the vernacular, this ain't that. This honey is dark, and VERY strong. When the box arrived from Amazon today, I made a batch of buttermilk biscuits and sat down to enjoy a real treat. Unfortunately, it was no treat at all. The strong flavor of this honey overpowered the delicate flavor of the biscuits. It was very disappointing.<br /><br />So, if like me, you are hoping for the light golden sweetness usually provided by these little cups, look elsewhere, lest you be disappointed too. But if you like strong honey, like say, buckwheat, and you want the convenience of single serving cups, then this is for you."
2,"Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive."
2,"I didn't think this was very flavorful or spicy at all.  It wasn't terrible either though.  I think I would rather get real chai tea bags and just use sweetener instead of the instant mix."
2,"We will not be purchasing this product again. Items arrived broken as the boxes were packed into boxes much too large.  The quality was not up to par with most Pop Tarts."
2,"THE MUSHROOMS ARE HUGE, AND DO COME IN A LARGE JAR, BUT MINE WAS ONLY 2/3 FULL.<br /><br />TO USE, TAKE OUT 1 OR 2 MUSHROOMS, SLICE THEM TO SIZE WANTED (REMEMBERING THEY WILL SWELL UP) AND REHYDRATE THEM IN COLD WATER.<br /><br />THEY ARE AN ODDITY, AND HANDY, BUT QU9TE EXPENSIVE, AS COMPARED TO THE CANS OF SLICED MUSHROOMS."
2,"Oatmeal, raisins, and walnuts together sound like a good combination.  That part of the cookie is good.  I gave a star for this combination.<br /><br />However the remainder of the cookie was awful.  It didn't taste right, and I blame it on the soy.  Why do all otherwise good products have to have soy in them?"
2,"This tuna may have been packed in Italy but it distinctly says on the bottom of the case ""Product of Thailand"". Not what it was and my local grocer has it for about the same price when it goes on sale."
2,"I am used to KAL stevia, and having read some of the other reviews, perhaps the one I received was from a bad batch. But - I have had to use AT LEAST 4-5 times as much compared to KAL to sweeten most items, and for some items (i.e. my high protein breakfast drink) it just disappears. Never has quite the same ""sweet"" effect of the KAL either."
2,"I've owned a couple of these for several years, and have had to repeatedly replace the upright support arm (about $15 a pop about once a year). The arm has two copper-covered contacts which erode (NOT corrode) to the point where the copper covering entirely disappears. The company REFUSES to acknowledge this problem, so I've left there customer pool for good, and mm spending my time and money researching far, far cheaper alternatives using good old aquarium air pumps and air stones, soda bottles and LEDs -- you can get LED grow lights now that work in regular lamps. (I'll probably also try a hack involving the old basins from the AG 7-pod units, but -- now that the upright arms are worthless -- using an external aquarium air pump and air stone, and a separate LED. You can find other self-contained table-top hydroponic systems for less than half the cost of these, if you don't want to goof around with soda bottles. Yeah, the AGs are spiffy gadgets (until the copper connections fail), but the Customer Service stinks, and you can do everything this does on your own for much, much less cash."
2,"It smells good. It's made to be used in African American hair or Biracial hair. It works on natural Black hair an on relaxed Black hair. I'm natural and I only use natural oils on my hair. Two of the oils in this jar are bad for your hair, scalp and it inhibits hair growth. No one should put Petrolatum and Mineral Oil on their hair. I guess some people can use it to seal with if they don't object to the Petro and Min Oil."
2,"the top opening devise is the worst I've ever dealt. when you pour it spills all over the top. oil is good, pouring devise lousy--alain"
2,"I got it primarily for my husband - to encourage him to eat healthier. He loves chocolate, anything chocolate, so I had high expectations for this cereal... Alas, it was not meant to be. He hated it and so did I for that matter. There is something about the chocolate flavor that is quite off putting. This cereal is only slightly better than chocolate Coco-Roons (they make me want to toss my cookies), but not my much."
2,"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable."
2,"I like these sardines and it seemed like a good deal so I ordered the box. Arrived a while ago. Two of the tins had broken open and everything is soaked in olive oil. I expect some kind of satisfaction from Amazon, have already sent an email inquiry. If they make good on it, I will edit the review to reflect the fact.<br />I was promptly contacted by amazon by e-mail and offered a refund  which I accepted."
2,"After baking 1 bread from the 12 boxes I noticed the date on the yeast is only good until April, 2 1/2 months away. No wonder the bread didn't rise very well. I'll be returning the rest. I called the company that makes this bread and they told me they didnt know it was being sold on Amazon. They have no control over how or where this product is being stored or if properly, so please don't buy it from amazon."
2,"The packaging is great - the coffee - not so much, harsh flavor and I love dark roast blends - so I am no wimp. This coffee leaves a lot to be desired, I cannot wait until it is all gone and I can move on to the next box of different and better coffee!"
2,"I am not sure how good something can be for you that tastes distinctly like amonia."
2,"The taste is very good.  Problems I had were that this was European product so<br />I had to figure how to convert to cups and ounces.  Although I like the taste and<br />convenience, I will not purchase again because of expensive s & h.  I will look<br />for this product locally unless it's offered by Amazon on Super Saver."
2,"Maybe they dont put enough of the ""white"" products savers in the bag.  The jerky was stale and hard in both bags.  Go with the smaller bags for basically the same cost when you add up the total ounces.  Wont be getting the bigger back again from Amazon!"
2,"Imagine yourself craving coffee. But you're on... a big ferry boat. With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy. So you aren't stuck with 23 k-cups that make you cringe :)"
2,"I love chipotle flavoring...normally. I've had some Chipotle Ranch sauce that was good and so I thought this might be worth a try. My family did not care for it. It didn't taste like real chipotle but I guess I shouldn't be surprised because Taco Bell isn't real mexican food (to me). I wouldn't recommend this if you are at true chipotle lover"
2,"I used to buy these regularly at BJs in a multi pack box, but then they stopped carrying SB products. The chocolate peanut butter ones were always my favorite. I haven't been able to find them for a long time so when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped on them:) Eagerly awaiting their delivery.<br /><br />I hope they travel well, as when I purchased a box of Atkins bars, the chocolate looked as if it had been left in too high a temperature and was all discolored.<br /><br />I will update the review when they arrive.<br /><br />Jan 18, 2012<br /><br />They just arrived today, and I'm sooooo disappointed. They're not at all as I remember. Left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. They're not made by Kraft anymore, either. Even the texture is different. They used to be nice and crispy, but now they're just - odd.<br /><br />I have 39 more of these to go:("
2,"The description says 25 oz.  That is the WEIGHT.  It contains just 18 fluid oz.  Buyer beware."
2,"I got this because it was the only ""chilli mango"" with free shipping. A mistake. Sugar is<br /> overwhelming, hiding the mango taste. Chilli and lime are barely and distantly detectable. If you are looking for an expensive generic sweet, this might make you happy. If you are looking for the exotic, multi-layered taste of mango and chilli, look elsewhere."
2,"They are better than eating nothing, but they taste like lightly flavored air.  My husband and I were not impressed.  They were also pretty expensive.  We will never purchase them again."
2,"My first order was perfect, second one, not too much, all the prezels were chipped or broken. lots of crumbs in the bag this time around, not sure if I will re-order."
2,"I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase."
2,"We were unhappy with the food our breeder used. High percentage of corn. After reading lots of labels, in theory this seemed to be just what we were looking for. We went through a careful, slow transition, but this turned out to be way too harsh on our Havanese's GI tract. He ate it just fine, but we would see a progression to larger and more greenish stool, then loss of form until he had a true liquid event. That was the end of that!<br /><br />For anyone with a toy breed, if you would like another option, we eventually transitioned over to Wellness Small Breed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AN2PUE"">Wellness Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food</a> . This turned out to be both a food he loves and the transition was effortless. He is behaving very puppy-like @ 3 years old which I feel is a good thing. The Wellness  food brand was never part of the 2007 animal food recall list for melamine (rice gluten) and is corn, soy and wheat free."
2,"DONT BE FOOLED - This is not a Health Cereal.<br />The second ingredient is SUGAR and this cereal also has fructose in it.  I feel like I'm eating kid cereal.  It would be healthy if it had less sugar in it.  Carb-conscious people and diabetics BEWARE."
2,"Has a light brown color, ""mousse"" type texture, and my two rather non picky cats will eat about one bite of it.<br /><br />Fortunately we have four dogs to take up the slack."
2,"I have a bichon and I thought this would entertain him for at<br />least 15 minutes, but it didn't. He solved it quickly, within 5 minutes and looked at me as if to say, that's all?"
2,"I just didn't use up this product.  The sugar came as a solid hunk and I had to grate it in order to use it.  Made a sticky mess all over my kitchen counter.  Came four packs to the package and I still have three."
2,"I have an old cat. I feed him with wet food or dry food soaked in water. First, he doesn't like this flavor, second, he often vomits undigested food after eating this. Last, this food doesn't dissolve in water, it's very hard, and have something gel like. Also, my cat's waist has the color of this dry food, which is light brown. In total, I don't think this food is healthy and tasty for cats."
2,"Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen/melted, as if they'd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so I'm not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.  The affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the Keurig."
2,"I would never recommend this item. I made it tonight with some vegetables and it pretty much ruined dinner. The taste is very bland (unlike other brown rice pasta that I've had) and the noodles are so small that they seem to divide and conquer the plate and completely take over. These are thinner than regular vermicelli and probably should just be labeled as an Asian brown rice noodle instead of trying to be an Italian vermicelli noodle. If you're seeking a brown rice noodle that tastes good and has substance to it, this isn't it. Try Tinkyada instead."
2,"Chicken Soup has a great reputation.  It is supposed to calm nerves, and cure anything from the common cold, to cancer.  Or so tradition would have one think.  I dunno....  Chicken soup never did me any harm, I guess -- but I can't remember it curing anything, either.  Though not my favourite soup, I never really disliked it.  OK....<br /><br />My mother makes a clear soup.  Soak the chicken, and vegetables, under a low light, in a covered pot, for hours.  Then, take the fat off with a ladel.  Remove the chicken and vegetables, and serve on a separate platter, (so that just the right amount of chicken stock and vegetables go into each person's soup...or none at all, if desired.)<br />Not bad!<br /><br />My own way of making chicken soup is a little simpler.  Take chicken meat, (breat, dark meat from the legs, whatever you wish), and cut into small pieces, (the smaller, the better.)  Place 1/2 milk, half-water mixture in blender, and slowly add chicken pieces, and mixed vegetables and spices if you wish.  After a few minutes, you have a nicely PUREED chicken soup.  Also not bad.<br /><br />However, CAMPELL'S HEALTHY REQUEST CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP, which I bought to save refrigerator space, (chicken parts have to be refrigerated, this soup does not) -- doesn't taste good, (OR like either my mom's chicken soup, or my own).  I suppose this is because ""modified food starch"", (the second ingredient in this Campbell's soup), was never used by either my mother or myself in OUR<br />chicken soups.  (Has ANYONE ever added modified food starch to their home-made chicken soups, I wonder?).  Yes, there are tiny bits of chicken meat in this soup, (fourth ingredient, after chicken stock, modeified food starch, and water)...but very little of these.  Most ofthe ingredients come under the heading: Less than 2% of"", but I begin to wonder if the ""chicken meat"" contained in the first section of ingredients, (those above 2%), may be like only 3% or so!  In the ""2% or less"" category are listed both ""salt"" and ""sea salt""....making for perhaps 4% salt, in toto.  This is supposed to be a ""low-sodium"" soup -- but is 410 mgs of salt, (17% of Daily Value), actually a ""low sodium"" soup?  Pehaps, compared to the regular Campbell's soup, (listed at 840 mgs on the label), it is.  But NO-ONE I ever knew puts even 410 mgs of salt into any home-made soup.  A preservative?  Yes.  But still too much salt for my taste.  VITAMIN E is also a preservative -- and a much healthier one at that.  More expensive -- definiely yes.  But it would make the soup far more palatable to have 1/2 the salt, (205 mgs), and then adding a little Vitamin E!  All I know is that this abundance of salt adds not only somewhat of a danger to my heart, but also a slightly sour taste to this soup.  Making it taste, not only sour, but also so very, very UNLIKE the chicken soup I either my mom or I make.<br /><br />Perhaps the regular, Non-Healthy Request Chicken Soup by Campbell's is better.  I'll get one or two cans from my local supermarket and see, before I buy 24 via Amazon, (which is what I should have done, before buying this ""Healthy Request"" Campbell's soup.)  Truly, I like their Heathy Request Mushroom and Celery Soups, and don't find their Healthy Request Tomato Soup half-bad.  But one can't judge every Campbell's soup by the ones that one likes, it seems.  This cicken soup is just too salty and too soury for me ever to buy it again.  But it is palatable...JUST palatable. So, yes, I will force myself to finish all twenty-four 10 and 3/4 ounce cans....maybe one every three days or so.<br />Chicken soup is, after all, supposed to be good for one.  Or so they say.<br /><br />I'm sure this isn't BAD soup.  I just wish it tasted better."
2,"There are much better coffee's available on the market for far less money that are of significantly higher quality.  I was very disappointed in this purchase."
2,"I love the convenience of having nutritional bars around the house for quick meals. A good bar is filling, has a reasonable calorie count, is nutrient dense, and tasty. Unfortunately, ThinkThin didn't fulfill any of these requirements. These bars are very heavy, both in their texture, weight and taste. These bars 'chocolate' flavoring tastes artificial and unrealistic and leaves a waxy aftertaste. Although they do give a whopping dose of protein, they left me feeling hungry not long after eating. The generous portion size and high protein content alone just don't justify an repeat purchase."
2,"I will never understand why they put Splenda into non-diet drinks but I can tell you that it was a horrible idea. So diet is undrinkable and so is regular. It tastes sooo awful. Maybe they'll get with the program and fire the fool that thought people would want to buy crap in a bottle."
2,"We both tried the cafe excellence white russian flaored coffee several times and do not like the taste. We like Cafe Excellence coffee but this is the first flavored coffee of this brand that we have tried. Not sure but it has an ameretto flavore that neither one of us like so that may be the problem."
2,"Wow, I just ordered this a couple months ago at $14 PRIME, and now it's up $9.  What's up with all this, everything is going up by $10 bucks or more (can goods, etc.).  Instead of making it worth our while to have subscriptions on regular items that we always use, they are pricing themselves out of the market, so when I have to go to the store, I'll buy the store brand, and they not only lose, but lose twice.  Crazy stupid marketing plan."
2,"This calorie-free, fat free, gluten free, etc. peanut butter is not a very good substitute for the real thing. It tastes nothing like peanut butter and has a very strange consistency. It separates in between uses and gets really watery on top. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a great tasting peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
2,"When I opened the bag the first thing I noticed was that even after being shipped, most of the cookies were complete and not just pieces.  Saying that, maybe I should have stopped there.  The cookie (cracker) is two inches in diameter and looks like a 'big' Ritz cracker.  The outside in scalloped and there are nine wholes in the center (maybe for more even cooking), but there are few pieces of fruit visible.  The flavor is 'cranberry citrus oats' but there are just a few dried cranberries and the citrus flavor must be from the 'natural flavor' mentioned as the last ingredient on the label.<br /><br />The serving size is three cookies which have a total of 140 calories with 45 calories (3.5g) coming from 'fat'.  With 22g of carbs it's a very fat cookie.  For the flavor you get versus the calories you get, it's not a very good trade.  On the plus side it only has 95 mg of sodium and 7 g of sugar (yeah!).  Try some sugarless gum instead.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz"
2,"Seeing such great deals here for Green Mountain Coffees, i assumed they would have the best deal on my Dark Magic blend I love. Most of the come in 2 packs with 24 in a pack. but the Dark Magic is clearly the exception. It is way over priced here. I can get an 18 pack in Target for $10, but low and behold over at coffee cow a 24 pack is 12.99 much better deal."
2,"Natural didn't mean less fat or carbs, and it was pretty tasteless, actually! It did pop fully, not alot of unpopped kernel's, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it again."
2,"I'm not a jerky connoisseur (and can't afford to be). I think the Golden Valley peppered beef jerky strikes a good balance of quality and value. The product looks, smells, and tastes pretty much like beef with some black pepper added to it. No MSG, no artificial flavors. Hours after you've eaten it, you won't feel like something is polluting you. The package has only a small amount of crumbs and small fragments, so it's finger food all the way to the bottom of the bag, not fingers-in-your-mouth food.<br />UPDATE: After a long period of subscribing to the Golden Valley Original 16-ounce packages, I've given up. The quality declined gradually, with pieces becoming smaller and tougher with not much flavor. But the final blow was a sudden decrease to a 12-ounce package -- at the same price. I'll have to find something else."
2,"This tray is huge, bulky, and awkward in the freezer.  It makes 2 oz portions, which are fine if you want to feed your baby 2 ounces of the same food, but I like to combine one ounce of this with one ounce of that.  Also, the cubes are fairly impossible to pop out of the tray.  You can run it under hot water as other users have done, but that makes a big wet avocado-ey mess.  I prefer to use regular ice cube trays with some saran wrap on top!"
2,"My case of Wolf chili arrived yesterday. Lets start with that. HEY AMAZON, whoever works in your shipping department should be fired. This case of chili was in a box about 8 inches larger than the case itself, no problem there. But only 1 piece of brown packing paper was used, and it was placed on top of the chili. There was no packing around the sides of the case, so this chili was sliding around in this box and tearing the box up. A few of the cans were dented, but no problem there. I worked in shipping and receiving before, and if anything was packed in this manner, it would be totally unacceptable. I am surprised UPS even accepted the package the way the case was sliding around in the box. Ok, enough of that. On to the chili itself.<br /><br />I bought this because I had read so many reviews about how Wolf chili is supposed to be the best. Well, I gotta say that it doesnt even come close to the best. First of all, open the can and pour it into the pot. Thats right, pour. The consistency of this chili is almost like soup. Any other can of chili you would either have to shake vigorously out of the can or spoon it out, but this stuff just pours out. And I think there was beef in it, but it must have been ground up so small that it was hardly noticable, again, adding to that watery consistency.<br /><br />As for the taste, well, it aint bad, but again, nowhere near the best. But the consistency of the chili and the taste combined? Makes you wonder how anyone can rave about this stuff. 4/10 at best, and thats being kind.<br /><br />If you want the best, I would go with Stagg. Many different flavors and a much higher quality, and better consistency."
2,"The taste is okay is not very strong peppermint, stick in you teeth , does not last long ( maybe 2-3 minutes maybe less ). I am going to keep looking for a better aspartame free gum. thanks"
2,"Maybe they dont put enough of the ""white"" products savers in the bag.  The jerky was stale and hard in both bags.  Go with the smaller bags for basically the same cost when you add up the total ounces.  Wont be getting the bigger back again from Amazon!"
2,"Bone looked great, length was great, BUT my Mastiff managed to chew joint ends off and then started getting shards of bone.  Had to remove it and throw it away."
2,"I love strong tasting tea and these has no taste. I feel like I'm just drinking hot water. I would not recommend it."
2,"Well this tea was not what I expected. I was hoping for a minty coco flavor. I wanted to like this tea, but I just did not. It had a strange after taste that I could not shake. Too many flavors for real mint, it gave it a dirty funny taste. I think they tried to do too much here. I see where others loved it, I just did not. I don't think I can drink anymore of it. Be cautioned if your looking for a minty, chocolate tasty treat, this is not it. Too many flavors give it a muddy strange taste. I'm sure I will get slammed for my opinion, people hate people who disagree with them here on Amazon, but in good conscience I could not rate this any better."
2,"I have recently noticed that the last few months of Trio snacks received are stale and more brittle than usual. I am told that this product is made in China which concerns me.<br /><br />I cannot find madatory expiration dates on the box which causes me even greater concern. I hope Amazon is reviewing their food products prior to shipping."
2,"My quest to find THE perfect green tea led me to 'Bigelow'.  A big name in the tea industry.<br /><br />I steeped a Japanese green tea (Sencha) in one clear glass mug and Bigelow's in another glass mug.<br />Rules:  allow the boiling water to sit for 4 min.  Then gently steep for 4 min.  Place onto a large pure white table top.<br />The difference was dramatic.  The Bigelow's green tea looked brown next to the Sencha tea.<br />The taste was just as dramatic.  Bitter initial flavor with a dull harsh after taste vs. A Smooth consistent green tea flavor.<br /> I repeated this 3 weeks later with a different batch of Bigelow's.  Same difference.<br /><br />So if it's GREEN tea your looking for - Bigelow's  is not the one."
2,"the fiber content of this ""powder"" is amazing but the the taste and texture are almost unbearable. while hemp is not going to taste as good (by good taste-i mean an absence of taste) as soy or whey, it should at least be better than this.<br /><br />my gripes:<br /><br />texture- this product should not be called a powder at all. it's more like the contents of a tea bag. the product should be more finely ground.<br /><br />taste- this hemp has a stronger taste than other brands i have tried. i haven't found anything that really goes well with the ""earthy"" taste.<br /><br />the good news:<br /><br />fiber-i believe one serving provides 54% of the DV. that's 2-4 times as much as other hemp powders. this is why i gave this product 2 stars instead of one.<br /><br />the good news about all hemp:<br /><br />it's not highly processed like whey, soy, rice or other protein powders.<br /><br />it's organic. most hemp powders are organic because hemp is naturally resistant to pests. ever wonder why you never see organic soy protein? hexane. this is the chemical (similar to gasoline) that must be used to isolate the protein from the bean.<br /><br />it's raw. yay!<br /><br />other brands:<br /><br />i have tried nutiva, ruth's and living harvest. i currently use and recommend living harvest. it has the best consistency and taste. ruth's contains slightly more vitamins than living harvest but has a slightly stronger taste. nutiva is by far the worst with the strongest taste, grainiest texture and least vitamins.<br /><br />i find that the best recipe for a hemp smoothie is just a frozen ripe banana (use one with lot's of brown freckles-it may be a little gooey going into the freezer but as with banana bread, those bananas have the best taste), 2-3 drops of vanilla extract, some soy or almond milk and a scoop of hemp. hemp doesn't really seem to agree with berries or non-creamy fruits.<br /><br />bottom line-unless fiber is your #1 concern, go with another brand."
2,"I pre-ordeded this product before its release, so I had no reviews to warn me that it was sugar-free, nor was there any mention in the product name. The aspartame ruins what would be a decent tasting cider. I don't like artifical sweeteners, but it would have still been good if the sweetener was Splenda or Stevia. That aspartame takes over the taste!"
2,"My 6 month old kittens won't touch Wellness Kitten canned food.  I'm sure it's good for them but I can't get them to eat it.  I've tried on 2 separate occasions without any success.  One of my kittens is very finicky but the other one eats almost anything so I've given up on this brand."
2,"I tried integrating this into my German Shepherd puppy's food.  He is currently on California Natural Lamb and Rice puppy formula, but I have a hard time finding it - so I thought I would switch to this Royal Canin.  He loved it.  But then he started getting diarrhea.  The diarrhea may have been from something he ate in the yard and not the Royal Canin.  Regardless, I donated the Royal Canin to a dog shelter.  This is after I read reviews on it, and discovered it has some bad reviews.  It has lots of fillers in it.  I prefer a more natural, healthier dog food (this is my opinion after what I've read).  There are good websites to compare pet foods and read professional reviews on them."
2,"I really like ChooChoo R Snacks Jerky, their quality is exceptional as I have stated in a previous review for their ""Big Slabs"" and their ""Country Cut"". But this Jerky which I got today with the soy sauce is really not my taste, it is absolutely salty, and the soy overpowers the meat flavor itself, and far as smoky flavor is concerned, there is none I can taste,the jerky is also unusually greasy, really coated in grease to be factual. I will personally only stick with ordering their ""Country Cut"" and their ""Big Slabs"" where you taste the good flavor of the meat, and the jerky is moist, but NOT greasy."
2,"I have ordered these suckers before i guess it must have been through a different seller and it is worth paying the shipping because when i paid for the shipping half the box wasnt broke! I just got these today and the suckers were all sticky due to most of them being broke what a great package to recieve!"
2,"These are a fun snack that taste great and are always popular at parties.  But they are way cheaper to buy at Costco, so sadly they get a low star rating from me."
2,"These are ok. The best way to describe the taste is that they taste like pepsi cola that's gone flat. They're not terrible but they also aren't that great."
2,"These were just OK as far as taste and there were several damaged pies ( still sealed and edible). They were some of the most expensive mini pecan pies on Amazon, but far from the best. Buy the moon pie brand."
2,"I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the ""Farmers Market"" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem."
2,"I used to use Splenda a lot, from some packages to large bags.  I've gone over to Truvia for the taste, maybe a personal preference, but I'm allowed that.  What I really can't see is how adding a little vitamin E and C to the mix results in almost twice the price as the regular product, and far far more than just buying bulk product and popping a vitamin a day, which will also give you 100+% of your daily antioxidant recommendation as opposed to 5 packets of this.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm not falling for it."
2,"These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields."
2,"I used this product a couple of years ago when I was on a diet.I really did enjoy it .So when I needed to loose weight again I ordered some more.The only thing I can think of that is different this time is I had been dieting about 3 months when I ordered them and I must have been extremely hungry or maybe my digestive system is just not as good(I am almost 61).They seemed to have stuck in my throat for about a 1/2 hour.They did not taste like a food at all.Maybe I need to diet a few weeks and try them again.Maybe then I will be hungry enough to appreciate them."
2,"My dogs enjoy these treats (which is why they get two stars instead of one) but I'm really disappointed in them. There is very little chicken on them, significantly less than in the product picture. I have previously purchased a different brand of these treats, Canyon Creek Ranch Yam Good <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N66R6I"">Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good Dog Treats</a> . There is a HUGE difference in the amount of chicken on the Canyon Creek Ranch treats compared to these. See my picture comparison of the two in the customer images. The Canyon Creek Ranch treats have a nice thick piece of chicken wrapped around the yam, the Kingdom Pets piece of chicken is so thin it is the color of the yam, I had to look twice to see if there actually was any chicken on several of the treats. On the positive side, if you're worried about chicken treats made in China, these are the treats for you, since there's hardly any chicken on them. Personally I'll be sticking with the Canyon Treat Ranch brand from here on out, when I give my dog a chicken and yam treat I want them to actually get some chicken. The Canyon Creek Ranch treats are a little more expensive but in my opinion they are a much greater value."
2,"I deserved to get a nasty product when I selected a product flavored with Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  If you really like Wasabi and Soy Sauce, buy this product.  The nuts are of a high quality."
2,"The Lavazza coffee Crema e Gusto is good,but it expires this month.<br />I bought four not knowing this(you should post expiration dates on food!)Now I will have three blocks of expired coffee. Not great folks!!!"
2,"I was looking for an inexpensive way to get pure hibiscus tea, as I'm a big fan of it.  A pound of it at this price seemed like a good deal so I gave it a try.  Upon receiving the tea, I discovered some other ingredients in this tea, particularly orange peel and cinnamon, that overpower the hibiscus (the eponymous and most important ingredient, as far as I'm concerned) and made it more like potpourri than hibiscus tea.  Fortunately, the components are in recognizably large pieces (which I see as sign of high quality) that I can pick out the undesirable bits.<br /><br />So if you're thinking of buying, be advised that this tea has cinnamon and orange peel.  I wasn't able to find that description anywhere on the product page."
2,"Excellent cookies, but the packages were all beyond the Best Sold By date... Since I wanted to give some as gifts, t was unable to do so.  Very disappointing."
2,"I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though."
2,"This tea is too strong for our tastes.  It's SPEARMINT and not the mint that we expected.<br />I think it would be better if it was less intense.  If you would make a second cup and drink it, it may be ok, but I won't order it again.  We prefer MINT."
2,"I love M&M Pretzels but the two star rating is because the bag I received from Amazon is old and stale. It came covered in that white frost when chocolate has been sitting too long or goes through drastic temp changes."
2,"This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee."
2,"I've only tried it once so far, but it seems to be lacking in flavor and you can't discern what type of poultry it is - although it doesn't have a turkey taste - closer to an extremely mild chicken.  I was hoping for a little more intense flavor than what I got.<br /><br />I do like the Southeastern Mills version (actually all of their flavors are good), but cannot seem to find it in a frugal size (just the small couple ounce packets for more than $1).  A 2 pound version of that at a reasonable price would be great."
2,"This is not really English breakfast tea.  It is closer to a Darjeeling tea, and seems to be all one tea not a blend.  The Yorkshire  tea is closer to English breakfast than this one.  In order to make this tea more useful, it is better to blend it with another tea such as ceylon tea, or one of the Indian teas."
2,"I bought these treats in the hope of putting a little weight onto our eldest cat.  She can't have grain, so I thought this would be a good purchase.  Unfortunately she turned her nose up at it.  Three others did the same as well.  They would rather bat it around than eat it.  The one cat that does eat the treats doesn't need to.  It's possible that I just bought the wrong flavor, but I am hesitant to purchase more."
2,"When I placed the original order it was not delivered. Then a replacement one was sent and when my wife received them they were limp and would not stand up in the vase. These flowers were suppose to be a surprise delivered on the day we found out what sex our baby is. I am very disappointed in this service. I have bought a lot of things off of Amazon.com and never had any issues, in fact I have been thrilled with everything excepy this flower service."
2,"I've been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff I have tried yet. I believe by ""Fine Tea"" they mean small particle size. My box is about the consistency of a box of dirt, instead of nice leaf parts. Following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea. There is too much bitterness in this tea. I would definitely suggest checking out the Adagio teas. My Mother-in-Law gave me a sampler for Christmas and it had some excellent teas."
2,"I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans."
2,"Misleading advertisement!  Ad stated glass bottles and mine came in plastic bottles. I ordered this item because it was in glass! I am really dissapointed in this order."
2,"This cinnamon flavor in this tea is overwhelming. It really hides any tea taste. Would not buy it again."
2,"I wish I could give this coffee a positive review, as Papua New Guinea coffee is not always easy to find. But this was not very good. Three separate bags shipped in the order. The roast of all of them was very uneven and much too light, although I know that is matter of personal taste. But an even roast is a minimum requirement. As the result, there was no consistency from pot to pot. A cup might be very good one day and bitter the next. So I shan't buy this again."
2,"I received 2 of these with my first ever Omaha steaks order and they turned out being the biggest disappointment so far out of everything included in my order, for a few reasons. 1, the image is deceptive, because the stuffed sole looks nothing like the picture, but that's typical marketing stuff and to be expected to some degree. 2, these aren't really ""stuffed"" with scallops and crab meat. The stuffing is basically 97% clumps of flavored bread or something, and there's very little crab or scallops. 3, the ingredients. The 3rd most used ingredient in these ""stuffed"" fillets is, as listed on their website ""INGREDIENTS: Sole Fillets, Water, -> Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil &lt;-"" Which means, traces of trans fats. Absolutely ridiculous to find this ingredient in a ""gourmet"" food at this price period, let alone see it listed as the 3rd most used ingredient. I can buy 100% organic stuffed fillets from Trader Joes or Whole foods for far less and not have to worry about crap ingredients which renders the healthy concept of eating fish pretty much useless. Now, all that being said, the 1 I ate tasted fine...but the deal breaker for me was the traces of trans fat. But if you don't care about things like that, these make a fine addition to any Omaha steaks order. Taste wise, they tasted pretty good. I used a lot of lemon, so mine weren't overly buttery as the lemon probably minimized the overly buttery taste that some have compained about, which is made with the hydrogenated oils. I've been surprised as Omaha uses pretty much all quality ingredients in all of their products that I've sampled so far...except for these. I definitely wasn't expecting to see traces of trans fats in a fish product. I didn't even bother to check until afterwards because out of everything I've tried from OS I haven't even come across high fructose corn syrup...which is a huge plus. Neither HFCs or Partially hydrogenated oils were even found in their stuffed baked potatoes, which was a huge surprise as stuffed potatoes are usually full of both of those ingredients. If you can make a delicious baked potato full of sour cream, bacon, cheese, without partially hydrogenated oils, surely OS is capable of doing the same with these stuffed soles. And put more crab meat and scallops in there already. This product is perfect calorie/carb/fat/protein wise...but using cheap ingredients like hydrogenated oils is unacceptable in ""gourmet' food imo"
2,"they don't provide splenda at the office so i bought one to keep at my desk - the packaging malfunctioned and now i can't get my splenda tabs out!"
2,"I've been using a tub of the tangy orange flavor for the last 6 months and its been great. Pretty good flavor, no bad aftertaste, seems to have performance and recovery benefits.<br /><br />I ordered tropical fruit the other day and I'm not sure what to think. I read a review that said some flavors taste like soap. I didn't believe this, but here I sit, with a soapy aftertaste in my mouth. I'm not sure I want my mouth to taste like soap 50 miles into a bike ride.<br /><br />This new batch is CytoSport's new formula with Stevia. I don't know if the tropical fruit flavor tastes bad, or if the new formula tastes bad, but its certainly terrible. I don't think stevia tastes like soap, so I'm confused about the flavor.<br /><br />Please fix this CytoSport, I wanted to be a fan."
2,"I must have got a bad batch because it is not hot and has very little flavor. It was nothing like the reviews."
2,"These Pringles taste great. I bought 3 tubes of the from the grocery store yesterday and snacked on some of them last night after getting home. That's the only reason I didn't give them 1 star.<br /><br />I recently tried these out by eating 3 or 4 of these chips at someones house. I felt fine and was and thinking that the Olestra didn't bother me at all, so I decided the whole evil Olestra thing was totally blown out of proportion and wanted to get some. I came home from shopping and made myself a light dinner of chicken and rice. Then, while watching a movie, I ate about 1/3 of the container of chips.<br /><br />The next morning, about an hour after waking up, my stomach started hurting like CRAZY. The abdominal pain was so bad it nearly brought me to tears. I can snack all day on a bag of Dorito's and not bat an eye, but a bowl of Pringles with Olestra brought me to my knees! The pain did not stop for HOURS. It lasted from about 10am until 3pm.<br /><br />Even after the pain subsided, my insides felt sore, as if I was punched in the stomach over and over. I wish so much these didn't cause such a bad reaction. They would be my new favorite chips! But I'll stick with the regular Pringles and take the fat over that pain again any day.<br /><br />I'm not saying everyone will have the same experience as I have had. But I would HIGHLY suggest snacking on these on a day when you do not need to be at work or kids be at school afterwards."
2,"I have been cycling a few hours in the heat on weekends, and using this type supplement to get what I need while riding, so I bought a case of the Tangerine with Caffeine. I have to say they seem to do the job and give me what I need, and the boost from the caffeine works as desired. The problem I have with the product is the taste is pretty bad, like concentrated children's aspirin. Also, the container/package seems to react with the my teeth or fillings, like having a battery on your tongue. So, basically consuming these is not pleasant, and I dread having to do it (like taking medicine). So, I will stick with the main competitor in this marketplace ""Gu"", which taste great."
2,"PROS<br />-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)<br />-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)<br />-baby loves them!<br /><br />CONS<br />-stains!  As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)"
2,"Originally this product was advertised and labeled as ""Extra Bold"". Amazon did not offer a response, exchange, or refund, when the product was brought to their attention the second time it arrived. The K-cup product was later classified as ""Light Roast""."
2,"I should have heeded the warnings of the less than stellar reviews.  It's your typical sugar free, made with Aspartame drink - it's TOO sweet and it leaves a HORRIBLE aftertaste. It even smells fake.  For me, it is a complete waste of $9.99.  However, if you like diet drinks, you would probably like it."
2,"My cats seem to like the smell of this catnip.  However, I usually crush catnip to release the scent before I give it to the cats.  With this product, I have been getting sharp splinters from the woody part of the plant in my fingers.  I have noticed the cats sometimes seem to also get jabbed.  I won't buy this brand again."
2,"This is a seitan (wheat protien) product with a strong anise (licorice) flavor that dominates the thai peanut taste. If you like black licorice, you may like this. Count me out."
2,"I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else."
2,"Not as much flavor as i would like.  without adding vegetables and or chicken it's bland. For me this is food to keep in case of a disaster."
2,"Seriously.  My wife nabbed this at the store the other day because our girls are in love with Nutella and she thought this might be a nice change of pace for them.  The idea of chocolate peanut butter is not a new one.  Just open your eyes and look at the cookie aisle in any grocery store.  They are lined wall to wall with chocolate peanut butter flavored cookies.  It's like the most popular flavor on the market.  I, honestly, am not always a fan and wish that there was more variety out there, but whatever.  The masses have spoken and `chocolate and peanut butter' are a `thing' that just won't go away anytime soon.  This product though, doesn't utilize that flavor very well.  In fact, all we are left with is peanut butter that is the consistency of melted chocolate.  I don't taste the chocolate at all.  Instead it's like really sticky peanut butter.  I guess the only real taste difference is that it is a cloyingly sweet variation of your standard peanut butter.  I don't like this.  My kids liked it, sure.  It is basically dessert, and if you like peanut butter you won't be offended by this, but I don't see a point to this product at all."
2,"The taste was very good on this product but I bought the 12 pkg plan and the bags each were anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 crumbs or small pieces you would only use on top of a casserole.  No dipping or presentation wise nothing.<br /><br />However since I need unsalted chips they were worth a try and I need to cancel future orders of this one and stay with the Michael Season's kettle ones which of course were more durable and they too taste the same as the others.<br /><br />Amazon please note to cancel automatic shipping on this product but keep the one for the Kettle chips - thanks"
2,"tastes disgusting; when you bite into it, there's a great chance you could be biting into a chunk of fat..I tried the sweet and spicy and hickory, and they both had the same outcome..go elsewhere for some quality beef jerky!"
2,"I tried the product since I can no longer eat sugar thinking it would be a good substitute. It tasted too heavy and too sweet I did not enjoy the product and will not purchase again."
2,"60 dollars for a 24 pack of Arizona tea?<br /><br />Arizona Tea are 1.09 a can in the store its more than double the price here. I love the Black and White tea but 2.58 a can is way to much."
2,"that is so unfair. I was a faithful customer now i have to go buy them somewhere else . Why Amazon!!!"
2,"The meat tastes GREAT. Unfortunately the shipping was 4 times the cost of the meat. I had looked into buying this 2 months earlier but never finished the order because of the outrageous shipping cost. Then I was placing a quick order for schoolbooks for my son and this was still in my cart. I had forgotten about the shipping cost and ended up buying it. I didn't find out until it arrived that I had paid $79 shipping for a $20 product.<br /><br />On a positive note, it was delicious."
2,"They taste ok but so close to being expired, i'll never eat all 24 bags by then. Not sending back such a big bulky item."
2,"The only thing good about this product is the packaging.  The chips themselves are okay, not great.  Very crunchy, but about 50% of the chips in the bags are very hard to chew on.  They are as hard as rocks.  I bought 12 bags a few months ago and still have about 5 left.  For each bag, I can eat about 1/3 (those red and orange chips and taro are not too bad).  The rest of the bag is thrown away because those translucent chips are as hard as rock.  Maybe some people like this kind of chips.  Do yourselves a favor and try some at the grocery first before buying in bulk."
2,"The oil itself is great- my complaint is with the actual amount that is received in the container. When you open the lid, it looks like the entire container is filled with the oil. However, once you get past about the top two inches, you realize that there is about 5 inches of empty air. So, in reality, while you are paying for a 54 oz container of oil, you are really only receiving about 1/2 that much."
2,"I have been using flaxseed meal over the past three years; I would use them on almost everything from salad, soup to baking good. And, among several different suppliers on the market, I like Bob's Red Mill best for its reasonable price and trusty brand name.<br /><br />However, the latest batches I ordered were not nearly as good as before. They are dark, coarse (most is barely gridded), and BITTER!!!<br /><br />Check if yours with sell-by date later than 10/2008."
2,"I was expecting something better than what arrived. The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state."
2,"Simple as that. It was too sweet for me, especially in comparison to Island Oasis mixes.  The kids didnt even like it."
2,"I am trying to find higher protein alternatives to my snacks, so I figured I'd give these a try. I've already tried soy crisps, and I really love them.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting these to taste like real chips, but I am seriously disappointed! I couldn't even finish one little bag. They taste like cardboard! I'm not sure what I will do with the remaining 11 bags... What a waste!"
2,"I ate this cereal because it was so expensive to buy.But I will say the cereal is not very good at all.The fruit in the middle doesn't taste very good, it has somewhat of a chewy fake berry taste and it doesn't go well with the mini wheats. I have tried original frosted and also Strawberry and like both of these.But this fruit in middle I could do without.Great idea, because back years ago the strawberry with fruit was really good.But this time it failed to get me to buy more of this cereal."
2,"When I lived in Arizona, I used to buy dehydrated Refried Beans from the bulk section in New Frontiers, and it was great!<br /><br />I'm living in Chicago for the moment, and so I needed to find a good substitute for my New Frontier's refried bean mix.<br /><br />I am writing this review to WARN you that I DID NOT find a good substitute with this product.<br /><br />The consistency is good, thus the 2 stars, but that's about all that's good about it.<br /><br />First of all, the prepared beans have no taste.<br /><br />But the worst part is that Amazon and the product listing don't tell you that one of the ingredients is TBHQ.<br /><br />I only discovered this because I started to have a reaction about a half hour after eating the beans.<br /><br />I got itchy joints, waves of nausea, weak muscles, sleepiness, voracious thirst, cotton mouth...<br /><br />I thought I would find MSG on the side of the package, because those are symptoms I get after eating MSG.<br /><br />But then I saw that the preservative was TBHQ, which I had not heard of before.  I did some research and found out that many people have MSG-similar reactions to TBHQ.<br /><br />This product also contains soybean oil, and I do my best to avoid anything with soy.<br /><br />You may not be sensitive to these ingredients, but I wish someone had written a review mentioning this because if they had, I wouldn't have ordered the product.<br /><br />I am now stuck with 7 more allergy-inducing packages of this stuff."
2,"I ordered the regular Chef's Reserve and I received Decaf. The Jamaica order was correct and I received regular coffee.  But I don't drink Decaf. Luckily my wife on occasion does drink decaf.<br /> /tln/"
2,"If the price for a 3-pack remains at $39.99 + $12 shipping, DO NOT PURCHASE!!! If you go to Spice Place, the same price gets you DOUBLE the amount ($13.43/16 oz)!! I trust that Amazon shoppers are discerning consumers so I feel a duty to point that this pricing is a ripoff and that you can find better.<br /><br />Apart from that, I love the mix. A tasty way to prepare it is by mixing it with just light whipping cream, maybe a little sour cream to thicken."
2,"I've tried many different green teas as iced tea in an electric brewer, all with good results. This seemed like something worth trying, since I've always liked jasmine green tea, so I'd probably dig lemon flavor as well. And if any of ginseng's benefits for the body are real, why not? But while this one was brewing, the entire kitchen smelled less like lemons and more like Lemon Pledge furniture polish. I figured that was a fluke and the flavor would probably be subdued after it was chilled. I was wrong. The flavor was practically caustic, beyond bitter, making my lips numb afterwards. I ended up pouring out the pitcher and trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the bag. Based on an earlier review, I'll probably buy an infuser and try using this for hot tea at a lower temperature. Unfortunately, I can't control the temperature of my brewing machine, so if you're doing the same this tea may not be the best choice."
2,"I love stevia and am always making and buying healthy organic foods for our family. I gave up sugar 9 months ago and thanks to stevia it is going great! However, this product contains too much fiber. My husband and I have been having these terrible stomach aches recently ( never used to ), the only thing I can think of is my recent use of this form of stevia. While a little fiber is great, too much is bad for your body. I have been using it in everything; baked goods, pancakes, my homemade pasta sauce, even our tea and water. Now we are learning what over use of this product can do! My other problem with it is the fact that it ""poofs!"" when you bake with it. I am very careful but no matter what I do it all goes into the air and my lungs. It does not blend easy a bit. The only way it blends is if you mix it with hot boiling water first. Spend the extra and get the liquid stevia without fiber!"
2,"I had high expectations for this product considering the other reviews, but I cannot choke these things down. Not trying to down talk these things, but I just can't eat them. To me its just short of flavered cardboard.  Oh well."
2,"I am on my second bag of Maca, taking 2 tablespoons each morning. I like its weird bitter flavor (but then I like every vegetable on the planet, so don't go by me as to flavor). My purpose in taking it was to alleviate a borderline slow thyroid (medically diagnosed) and symptoms of adrenal fatigue (not officially diagnosed, but felt). Maca supposedly helps with endocrine functioning.<br />However, I have not noticed any difference. It has not hurt me, but has not helped either. After reading the other reviews, perhaps I should stop and read more about it.<br />Thanks to all commenters for sharing."
2,"Although, the chocolate was good, and the inside was very creamy; it seemed that every chocolate was Hazelnut-flavored. I was very disapointed in the flavors of this chocolate. Especially after reading such glowing reviews, I was upset recieving something that was decent, but just buying a cheap box of chocolates at the store is just as good. You want delicious chocolates, go for Godiva."
2,"Got a wellness dog treat before which the dogs absolutely loved. Then i bought this dog food... very weird. None of my four dogs like it. Sniff, and go away. Regardless how good it is... if it can't even appeal to the dogs, it means nothing. Only one of my dogs is picky about food; others love almost every brand; esp. the 1st time they try a new dog food.<br /><br />Not this one. Embarrassing for me cuz I've opened it and can't return it."
2,"The bars taste good, but they are REALLY crunchy! It's almost impossible to eat them and not make a huge mess of crumbs--definitely not good for taking on the go to eat in the car!"
2,"Bought this for my 2 year old daughter, who normally loves ravioli. She thought it was disgusting and refused to eat more than two bites. She gave it back to me and said, 'trash'. I took a bite to see if it was really that bad...and it was! Gross! Only good thing I can say about this is the convenience...but at the same time, it's not very convenient if your toddler won't eat it!"
2,"This tea lacks the distinctive Scottish breakfast tea malt flavor. It is not bad, but no better than much less expensive teas."
2,"I recently purchased this product and thought it strange that it showed evidence of grit/dirt (i.e. when I steeped the tea in a glass jar I noticed that after pouring out the tea grit remained on the threads of the jar).  When I opened the 2nd bag that I purchased, about 1 month later, I found a clump of dirt (approximately 1/2"" in diameter).  I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was ""If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund"".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated ""we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)"".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.  Not sure if they will look into this situation more closely to prevent this problem in the future or not but check product for evidence of dirt if you are purchasing this product in the future.<br /><br />Update (2/27/12) - Davidson's did get back with me and sent me a new bag without charge when filling out the Amazon claim form.  Have not opened up the new bag to see if the quality has improved, but replacement bag was appreciated."
2,"I do like the flavor of this tea. It really tastes like blackberries. Sometimes I get herbal teas that sound good, but taste nothing like their name would imply - there are so many other stronger herbs in it. But this one tastes just like blackberries. It is slightly tart, but not much. It's a very refreshing tea, both hot and cold. I prefer it with no sugar. Although a bit of sugar seemed to bring out the vanilla flavor a bit more. It does make me wonder though, what are they using for the vanilla taste? The ingredients do not mention vanilla specifically...<br /><br />ingredients:<br />hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, **natural flavors**, dried black current, pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin<br /><br />I have been hearing that some companies are using something from beaver glands (yes, beaver) to use in food and beverages for vanilla flavoring. Vanilla beans are pricey where as beavers are apparently cheap. And it can be listed as ""natural flavor"" because it is nature-made, not synthetically made in a lab. I would feel much better about drinking this tea if it listed all the ingredients outright and did not use the term ""natural flavors."" Especially considering the name of the tea includes the word vanilla, yet there is no vanilla listed in the ingredients. For that reason, I can't say I am apt to drink any more of this. While sipping I kept thinking, beaver glands?? Really?? Possibly?? Eww!! I hope that is not the case, but I don't like thinking it could be a possibility. Lipton - if you read this, please verify. I'd love to know I am worrying over nothing.<br /><br />I hope it's more of an over-exaggerated rumor about the common use of beaver glands in food and drink. But still, it does make me get a little grossed out now when I see ""natural flavoring"" in anything with a vanilla taste to it anymore.<br /><br />If the ingredients listed vanilla bean instead of natural flavors, I would give it five stars for it's wonderful blackberry flavor."
2,"Coffee is fine.  But I won't buy again.  As another reviewer reported, this is not a standard K-Cup design.  Simply a paper filter below a plastic collar.  Shorter than a K-Cup, so doesn't come in contact with the bottom punch.  Water flows through the filter and into the cup . . . albeit at a faster rate than being forced through the small bottom hole of the standard K-Cup.  Do not attempt to brew a large cup, it will be too watery.<br /><br />Twelve servings come packed in a vacuum packed plastic bag.  When you open the bag, all twelve containers are exposed, so you'll need to repackage them in a zip-lock bag if you want to keep them fresh.  They do not fit in the standard K-Cup carousel."
2,"I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us)."
2,"I should have known better than to take a chance on a new cat food bought over the internet. Sophie (my cat)just gobbles up every bit of sauce and leaves all the chicken in the bowl. When I tried to cut up or mash the chicken I realized just how dry and tough it is and don't much blame her for not wanting to deal with it. You just never know if a cat is going to like something or not."
2,"Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee. If you are a fan of regular Starbucks you'll like this stuff."
2,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future."
2,"We had such high hopes for these but they did not live up to expectations.  We ended up throwing the entire bag away.  The kids hated them as did I."
2,"I grabbed a variety of various protein/energy bars, including a few different KIND bars after I got a free sample of the Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt. The DCK & Sea Salt flavor is now my ultimate measuring stick for the rest of the salty sweet snacks KIND provides. The Almond & Apricot flavor is particularly disappointing, unfortunately. Many of the other varieties are very satiating and flavorful, but the apricot fruit in combination with the nuts in this bar are a misplaced one. They just don't make sense on my pallet."
2,"Well... the coffee is certainly good, but I could barely taste any chocolate.  It just didn't have the flavor I thought it would.  I will keep and finish it, but wouldn't order it again."
2,"I'm not sure what all the rave reviews are about. My small dog doesn't really like them. And she's not exactly a picky eater. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because she'll eat it, but she always seems a little unsure of whether she wants it or not. And that's weird. She'd prefer a bite of a real apple to these any day."
2,"While I agree with the other reviews in the respect that it taste better than microwave, it doesn't begin to come close to actually theater popcorn.  It still lacked that buttery, sweet/salty taste found in theater popcorn.  If a duplicate of theater corn is what your are seeking, KEEP SEARCHING. YOU WON'T FIND IT IN THIS BRAND!"
2,"I cannot detect any vanilla flavor at all in this tea, instead it tastes like cloves."
2,"I drink energy drinks fairly regularly, so I'm familiar with the particular flavors associated with them, and it's common for a citrus flavor to be added to offset the taste of some of the ingredients.  On this product, they appear to have decided to try a grapefruit flavor.  It was not a good decision."
2,"When pouring the drink mix into 8oz of water, it definitely bubbled quite a bit, so watch out.  After mixing it up and taking a sip, I found the flavor to remind me of cherry flavored medicine, with an aftertaste of chalk.  While I appreciate the many vitamins included in the mix, I think they detract from the drink's taste.  This is the reason I don't care for vitamin water, either.  I'm the kind of person who would rather take a daily multivitamin, and drink something later on that I actually enjoy, instead.  For those of you who enjoy drinks with tons of vitamins (and the associated vitamin taste), and want energy without caffeine, this might be for you.  Acai and pomegranate have lots of antioxidants, which is the reason I bought it.  But I'm going to just stick with plain old acai juice."
2,"Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith."
2,"This coffee is extremely weak. It lacks flavor, like drinking a cup of hot water, yuck! Not what I expected from Green Mountain and the name ""Nantucket Blend""."
2,"I just cannot understand why this company chooses to add sugar to a fruit that they claim is tree-ripened.  I am truly baffled.  The added sugar leaves a crystalline sweetness that is not mango-flavored to the fruit and renders it a ridiculous replacement for mango.  It ends up being too sweet.<br /><br />Why buy dried mango?  If you cannot get fresh mango, it is the next best thing.  Canned mango, because the canning procedure demands heating the food above boiling point, dismantles all enzymes and antioxidants, but the drying process does not.  There are 3 fruits that are particularly valuable for the enzymes found in them: kiwi, pineapple, and mango.  These enzymes are not made by our bodies but are particularly helpful for the fast transport of calcium, boron, magnesium, phosphate, and manganese into cells whose membranes have been damaged (e.g. by circulating toxins, poisons, both of which we are always bombarded with, even if we do not recognize the symptoms).  These ions, and thus the fruit enzymes, are critical for repair of those cells.  Since bacterial infections leave poisons behind, good dried mango is especially helpful for fast recovery from infections.<br /><br />The best mango is thoroughly dried, making it quite brittle.  If you want to snack on it or make mango ice cream, you reconstitute it by adding just enough water to cover a few slices (in warm weather it will take about an hour to reconstitute 1/2 cup).  Keep some in the refrigerator for just that purpose.  They last in that form there for at least a week, unless you live where there is an enormous amount of wet weather and thus a lot of mold.  Prevent mold survival in the refrigerator by keeping there a small plastic container with holes punched in the top half full of vinegar. Your fruits and veges will last a lot longer.<br /><br />However the best way to eat it is to add chopped mango to your entree or salad.  Thus this stuff this company is selling is just too weak in flavor, but the sugar will come off in the liquid found in the meal."
2,"I ordered this item, hoping that the combination of nuts would be good, but I was sadly disappointed with the taste.  Its like they tried to use as little sweetener as possible, leaving a dry, dull, bland taste and its like I could have just bought a bag of mixed nuts for cheaper than what I paid for this box of bars.<br /><br />Would not buy again."
2,"My first order for the product which i received was well packed and had plenty of whole product at the bottom of the bag.  This new shipment of the same product had product dust and a few granules at the bottom of the bag. I understand that in packaging there would be a certain amount of settling of the product at the bottom of the bag but what i received was almost 2 inches of product dust and small granules. Either this is a packaging malfunction or a quality review lapse. At the price i paid for it there should be enough whole product at the bottom of the bag as there is at the top."
2,"I find this product to have an odd taste, kind of burnt.  It will do but won't be my choice in the future.  When Sanalac comes back, I prefer it."
2,"I received this product.  It was for my daughters wedding.  They were edible, but not fresh.  Kinda dull green.  Was disappointed."
2,"I thought the hot choc. mix was not very sweet and didn't like it.  So unless you like you choc. a bit unsweet then don't get it."
2,"I tried these cookies at a GF expo.  The are delicious, especially the orange zest flavor, but very expensive.  Packaging was small and many of the cookies were broken.  I don't think I will be ordering them again."
2,"My family has loved this cereal for around 7 years or so before they ruined it. Also, the taste of the new sugar version is very poor. We have tried O's cereals without sugar from our local Whole Foods Market as well as Barbara's, but we don't really like them. For some reason, nothing stands up to the old version of Purely O's. We have now substituted Amaranth Flakes by Arrowhead Mills, which is a superior yet delicious cereal in my opinion (as well as my 2 little girls' and husband's opinions). We have abandoned O's cereals for now, not being able to really like Barbara's or WF's versions, but we will buy them if the original Purely O's cereal ever comes back. Certainly, if Cascadian Farms won't listen to its customers, then some other company should hopefully seize a great opportunity here. Especially since O's are so beloved by and wonderful for (developmentally) toddlers, who may grow to love them young, and keep them as a staple in their diet for years, perhaps for a lifetime. The opportunity for a company here is strengthened further by the huge market of devoted parents of young children who will seek out the healthiest version of O shaped cereal that their children will eat and enjoy... and will even pay a bit more for the higher quality. How we do care what we feed our precious growing tender dependent sweet little bundles of joy!"
2,"I grew up getting jelly rings from the dept store candy counters, but they are increasingly hard to find.  I ordered these hoping they would be the same, but they are not.  These are a dark chocolate (I'm not a fan of dark chocolate), and even taste a little old or stale.  The raspberry filling is not as sweet as I expected either."
2,"I received the order as expected and the label stated that it was strawberry pancake mix. On opening the first canister, I found that it contained BLUEBERRY pancake mix. I also opened the second on and found the same. I can only assume the third one is also blueberry. The blueberry was nice but I would have preferred what I actually clearly ordered."
2,"I recently purchased this hoping it would be good. I love Green Tea and enjoy trying different varieties. I was not too thrilled with this kind. It lacked flavor, was plain and just didn't have a strong green tea taste. I'd rather spend a little more for something that tastes more like green tea."
2,"I received raisins that had a best if sold by date of only a couple of months out.  The raisins were hard and dry.  I usually get the golden because they are soft and moist.  But these were not."
2,"Shipping was fast and quick so 5 stars to that. I was however disappointed in the olives. They are too briny and vinegary. They don't taste much different than green manzanillas or large queens from the supermarket. I will stick to the olive bar at Whole Foods Market for the BEST and most buttery smooth Castelvetranos"
2,"I almost bought this from here because I have free shipping and they were out of the banana ones. Not to knit pick, but beware, Amazon has this item incorrectly labeled as having 17g of protein, it only has 11g of protein. The only NuGo bar with only 2.5g of fat and 17g of protein I'm aware of is the banana chocolate ones (that's pretty incredible protein to fat ratio in a protein bar), and as I write this Amazon does not have that item available."
2,"sucks thought was a brand name the beans aren't eveb roasted what a rip off ordered some more that were actually roasted 1st"
2,"I used this product on half of my roses and left the other half without anything. Literally a day after application both of my sets of roses were eaten by the deer. I think the deer are going to eat my roses no matter what, but I won't spend money on this stuff anymore."
2,"I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value."
2,"old version of this product with the packaging shown in the picture was good. the new brown crosshatch pattern package (3 oz bags) version is no good. seems they sold out and went for cheaper beef and/or processing. really bummed out."
2,"My cats did not like these. Made one of my cats even throw up!  We'll stick with the Chicken ones as both of my cats LOVE LOVE LOVE those!"
2,"I have enjoyed the KIND bars, but these Almond Cashew ones are definitely not for me.  Much more dense and gooey that the other varieties that I have had, they did have a good crunch.  However, even the crunch felt slightly mushy at times.  With no real flavor to make up for the texture, I would not buy these again."
2,"Too sweet to my taste, the picture shows a lot more fruits and nuts that the bar actually has."
2,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!"
2,"Says it's vanilla, but the color of the frosting is lemon yellow.  Not very vanilla tasting, and the color is off-putting for a vanilla frosting."
2,"I didn't realize that it had so much artificial color in it and mineral oil. These are things I try to stay away from. However, I have used the product for about a week now. I plan to throw it out.  I really haven't seen any difference other than my scalp itching like crazy and green residue everywhere. I am disappointed that it is not an all natural product."
2,"The flavors you immediately notice after the first sip of this tea, are hisbiscus flowers and chamoile. The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life, this is not a bad tea at all. If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do."
2,"despite it's good reviews, I found this tea weak and not even close to the Twinings EB tea. Too bad that tea is no longer on subscribe and save. hopefully it comes back. would not order the Bigelow again"
2,"...so I drink mine diluted.  These sticks are meant for 16 ounce water bottles, but I empty a stick into a one (1) liter empty bottle which I fill with water from my Mavea water pitcher.  It still tastes heavy on the pineapple; in fact, I don't notice any mango or tea flavors at all. There is a ""too sweet"" aftertaste, also."
2,"I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  I bought this based on it NOT saying it was ""diet"" or ""low calorie"".  The first ingredient is Sugar so it's only partially sweetened with Sucralose.  Sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.<br /><br />Sure wish Amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products."
2,"I hadn't tried this flavor mint before (Rose) and they are just okay, but I'll not be ordering them again.  Sorry."
2,"Have been drinking Twinings Earl Gray for the last 10 years or so. However the last batch from Amazon was so mild and lacking the flavor that I had grown to love, that it was almost bland. Do not know how genuine the report on Wikipedia is, but it seems Twininigs, in their infinite wisdom has tweaked the original formula in April 2011. Going by my experience, it sounds about right.<br />Sad when a company has to tweak a great and well loved flavor, and still sell it as 'classic'.<br /><br />I will not be ordering it, till they bring back the original 'classic'<br /><br />Shame Twinings.<br /><br />Update: And just so you folks know..Twinings had said that they would send me a pack direct, to make up for my dissatisfaction. It is over 3 months and I am still waiting. I will not hold my breath. Looks like they changed their customer service formula too!"
2,"A good value, but not a very strong blend for expresso. Almost tasteless when used to make cappuccino with any type of flavoring."
2,"Bottom line - I don't like this coffee.  Tastes burnt to me.  Timothy's Sumatran Gold is the best."
2,"Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.<br /><br />Simply put it clumps.<br /><br />The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement."
2,"Very artificial tasting.  Can't particularly taste chocolate or caramel, and definitely no coffee taste.  Not sure what this tastes like, but it's not good.  Also a little sour."
2,"I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags... BUT I guess it was not the same in the smaller bags.  They were called Parmesan Chips but they were not as crunchy and they were full of parmesan.  There was almost too much parmesan on the chips in these smaller bags and it seemed as though at least 1/4 the bag is parmesan.  They just were not as good as the bigger bag.  Maybe it was a manufacturing error... but I will not buy them again.  I really wanted them for a protein supplement to my snaks.  OH WELL.<br /><br />If someone gets these and they are crunchy then I really would like to know that."
2,"Gotta say that I normally trust Amazon reviews.  I bought this because I have a hot water pot and sometimes am too in a hurry to brew.  I thought this would be a good 2nd option.  However, the taste is just funny.  There is something to this coffee that is similar to other instant coffees.  There is only a hint of that Starbucks goodness IMHO.  In no way is this product comparable to a Starbuck brewed coffee either at home or at an outlet.  I cannot recommend it.<br /><br />FYI:  purchased 12/26/11, expires 04/2012."
2,"I'm giving this two stars because they taste sort of okay. Nothing special - I'd probably call it three stars if they weren't labeled as Tim Tams. I grew up with Tim Tams and it's a joke to give them the same name.<br /><br />They're a version made for the American market. Skip these, try the real thing instead."
2,"Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so ""light"" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer."
2,"The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad."
2,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?"
2,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."
2,"Gloria Jean's is the cheap-o brand for the Keurig machine, and it shows.  They've got the honesty to say (on their regular 24-pod box) ""with the subtle taste of hazelnut.""  Boy, IS it subtle!  Not only is the flavoring weak, but the coffee itself isn't strong at the lowest (6 oz) setting and forget the 8 oz level; you might just as well be reusing pods.<br /><br />When we first got the Keurig, we got it with a selection of Green Mountain coffees.  I thought these were first-class but kind of pricey - you can get Gloria Jean's around here for about $.36 a pod.  This saves a fair amount if you go through 6-8 pods a day, but for the difference in quality, I just don't think it's worth worrying about.  If you have to have your coffee fix so you can get out the door, keep a couple boxes of Gloria Jean's around in case you run out of the good stuff, but don't use it regularly, or you'll find yourself giving up on your Keurig machine!"
2,"I really wanted my little shihtzu, Sheldon, to like this food but it was a no go here.  He barely sniffed it and walked away.  I loved the size of the cans as well as the impressive ingredient list.  I do have to say that it didn't smell alot like chicken to me though so I understand him not even tasting it.  Too bad though.  I would have loved to add this to the very small list of foods he will eat."
2,"When I bought this mat I initially thought it was fine but it actuality is too small and at the beginning my cats didn't like stepping on it either.  Because of it' small size, I end up with daily litter on either side of this mat.  Disappointed and now looking for a replacement that catches more of the litter."
2,"The cheese is great - the packaging is out of date.  The problem is the cheese ships in styrofoam, which is a petroleum based product that cannot be recycled and is a major source of ocean debris.  Thus, this product, although delicious, is non-sustainable because of its packaging.  For those who care about the environment, look to other sources for cheese.  I will."
2,"They are ok bcoz this has strawberry which are really sour and when you eat them with milk it does not taste good."
2,"I do not know what has happened to this product. I once loved it. Now it is completely dried up and almost tasteless! I continued to buy it many times hoping I had just received a bad batch but have seen no improvement. Too bad. It was once my favorite snack."
2,"I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged."
2,"Like other reviewers I found this tea to be very weak. Tea needs to STEEP. And really, how hard is it to open a teabag?? And all that plastic an foil waste from the K-cup! Let the Keurig make you a nice cup of hot water for the teabag and be done with it."
2,"This tastes bitter and sort of...fishy? The Jesper mate I got from Argentina was VASTLY superior. I'm not sure what they do to this Eco Tea brand, but I tell you, something ain't right. I went in without expectations, I'm not really a mate snob or anything -- this just really isn't very good. I'd steer clear and spring for something more authentic, unless you really just don't know any better."
2,"Too much sugar is added to the dried mango. It doesn't taske like mango. And it is too soft.<br /><br />The containers are too flimsy. Half of my 6 containers were broken when arrived, exposing the mango to air. The shipping box is intact. Just the mango containers; they are no good.<br /><br />The mango from Brand Philippine is much better."
2,"Well, they have an ok flavor..  but it's the seeds that do them in...  Very hard.  Now I love crunchy food... but these are teeth breaking crunchy..  I was getting them for the whole family, but I seriously doubt my kids will be able to chew them...  Don't think I'll be buying them again..."
2,"I wish Rihanna would get her face off this product.  It tastes nasty.  I bought a couple dozen since I love Vita Coco's products. However, this flavor is just the worst. They tried, and the taste has a hint of guava.  But it doesn't work in this package.  I have tried giving them away and nobody wants them - I still haven't seen anyone who likes the taste."
2,"Look at the label in the picture.  Sorry folks, but 610 mg sodium per 100 g (that's only about 3.5 oz) can't really be ""low sodium"".  I don't understand Zing Zang's claim especially since Tabasco Tomato Cocktail Bloody Mary Mix, mild  claims 485 mg /100 g and Mr./Mrs. T claim 640 mg / 120 g.  They are all way HIGH in sodium.  American Heart Association recommended sodium intake per day is about 1500 mg - so 2.5 servings of this stuff is it for the day?  I don't think that any of us can really believe that this stuff is ""low sodium"" as it says in the description of this product.  Amazon should insist that the description be changed."
2,"Been buying this product and was so happy to find a fairly healthy salad dressing that was actually very good!  In fact I even<br />told  our leader at WW about it.  Recently, I went to get more and they had none and said that it was a special order and could not get it any more and I couldn't find it any place so I ordered it on Amazon.  When it arrived I was showing someone the label ingredients and was amazed at the changes on the label.......very disappointed that I now had 6 bottles of a salad dressing I could not use since I am already on a low salt diet.  Had called the company and they said they had changed the recipe and no longer had that particular one......too bad!  It was very low fat, sodium and no sugar yet had an excellent taste.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTE680"">Drews All Natural Roasted Garlic & Peppercorn Dressing 12 oz. (Pack of 12)</a>"
2,"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"
2,"I applaud the use of natural ingredients but that's where the applause stops... The smell is unbelievably bad ( Salmon) and my dog who is a treat nut is not too crazy about them either. Honestly they just smelled like rotting fish."
2,"Upon opening the package, the two young Jack Russell Terriers began bouncing up and down --they could tell from the smell that this was a treat they were going to like.  I was not at all off put by the vaguely minty, grainy smell but my wife did not care for the smell at all.  The two youngsters ran to their crates where they immediately devoured the chews in less than 2 minutes.  The treats were also given to a geriatric JRT, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and an Australian Cattle Dog.  The old JRT also polished his chew off in a matter of minutes, it took the CKCS about 10 minutes and the ACD turned her nose up at the chew -- she literally pushed it into a corner of her crate and sat in the opposite corner as far away as possible from the treat.  The ACD is admittedly very picky about food and treats, but she absolutely loves bully sticks (as do all of the other dogs) which also last many times longer than these chews and cost less when one considers their staying power.<br /><br />In summary:<br />+4: Number of dogs liked<br />+0: Smell (some humans and dogs liked, others didn't)<br />-1: Cost<br />-1: Duration<br /><br />So, these chews get a score of two (2) given that all dogs in the house love bully sticks which provide much longer chewing enjoyment  at a lower cost."
2,"My only complaint about this product is that the chews should be a little smaller for cats.<br /><br />I have to cut them up or my cats won't eat them."
2,"I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl."
2,"I missed the fact that these are like jelly beans, I am used to purchasing chocolate pebbles.  They were really oversized so they just didn't seem suitable for the purpose of kids pretending they were pebbles, they really are best used as dinosaur rocks as some reviewers mentioned."
2,"I was disappointed with this tea.  The taste was no better than Liptons Yellow Label Tea.  I expected more from a Stash loose tea since I have had good expereience with some of their tea bags."
2,"The taste just isn't good enough to fit the price.  Overpriced, not healthy enough for that ""organic and good for you!"" price and the taste didn't impress anyone in my family including a slew of teenagers.  It will now sit in my closet. Sticky/chewy/tart/odd flavor is how I'd describe it.  I bought it after reading the good reviews but it's just too strange a taste for us to ever repurchase or to justify that high price."
2,"i surly bought it for the sake of a good sprayer but this is a spitter when you press it slow... it spit a strong shot of oil just like a water gun. but when u press it fast and hard it spread little bit good. the best thing in it that it is a glass.<br /><br />i give oil - 1-5<br />spitter  2-5<br />glass 4-5"
2,"The taste of this gum is not as fresh as the one in the grocery store. I wouldnt recommend buying this again."
2,"I recently switched dog foods for a months while traveling in the US to Iams and realized the corn/grains was irritating my dog's bowels- lots of soft stools and sometimes blood. Once I switched to Nutrisca her problems went away. This food may be good for comes dogs, but not for ours."
2,"So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."
2,"I love Chinese almond cookies and these were a brand name, but they are tasteless.  And no almond on top like you get in a Chinese Restaurent.  They just tasted blah.  Also, Amazon shipped these with heavy canned goods and the box of cookies arrived a little smashed. Amazon refunded the cookie money right away."
2,"I like the idea of the pouch baby food, but I was hoping that with a baby on the cover and a Stage 2 written on it, that it would be thicker. It was almost like water. It was a disaster. Maybe these are meant for older kids that get the concept of sucking them out of the pouch instead of being spoon fed to infants."
2,"I've used the European style drip sprouters by Bioset, now called the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N03EK0"">Victorio VKP1013 Round Three-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, for over ten years, with good results. There was room for improvement, but overall I was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure, and now I also grow micro-greens and baby greens in trays. When I decided to take the Bioset on an extended trip and it cracked (silly me), I thought I'd ""upgrade"" to this one, on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there, which maligned the Bioset-style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them. The Sprout Master was billed as the best sprouter in the world, a breeze to use, handy, yadda yadda yadda. The best thing since sliced (sprouted-grain) bread.<br /><br />This was not my experience. I guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style, with the exception of increased inconvenience. The Sprout Master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour-and-drip system. This did not bother me in and of itself, however, as I enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them. I was happy to put in more work for better results. Also, with this sprouter, you have to soak your seeds first, which the European style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds. When they are unsprouted, a bit of the water sits in the trays, allowing a mini-soak. Once they sprout, more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle. If you are really concerned about too much water sitting there (one of the complaints from the sprouting site), you just give it a few quick shakes, and off goes the water. Here, again, I was unperturbed: I like the process of nurturing my sprouts. Nevertheless, I began to wonder whether the results would be much improved.<br /><br />They weren't. It seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions. First, the holes for dripping, which I really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing, are too large to hold alfalfa, mustard, and similar small seeds, even after soaking overnight. You lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two. Then, unless you mist the seeds, rinsing tumbles them all around, in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase. This means that you don't get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber-careful. Were that not enough, my first batch just got rotten, moldy, and nasty--something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters. So I resolved to try again, thinking that maybe I didn't pay attention to placing the lids on properly (necessary in order to allow for air circulation). But first I had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter (the build quality is not encouraging), and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow, which I'd also never had to do with the drip sprouters. The second time around I got somewhat better results, but they still did not begin to compare to my standard Bioset crop, even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds. Far fewer seeds sprouted (and I'm using the same mix as ever), and they were a knotted mess. I could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth.<br /><br />Perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically. It may be, too, that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me, but I did not see the point. I knew I could do better, and the 30-day deadline for returns was glowering. So I sent it back, and am now trying Victorio's updated drip sprouter, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVPP04"">Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, which, though still not ideal, I much prefer to the Sprout Master. The new model is BPA free, made of crack-resistant plastic, does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version (an admitted nuisance), and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge. At half the price of the Sprout Master. So far, my first set of sprouts (again, using the same mix) did just dandy, without loss of seeds, mold, rot, tumbled sprouts, marauding roots or seed-clogged holes. Plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there. (The Sprout Master is opaque, so you can't see the sprouts once they've grown--nor would you necessarily want to, unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically.)<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted to like this sprouter, and feel like a ""real"" kitchen gardener. But I just didn't. In the end, what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest, not a name brand."
2,"They're cute and our dogs enjoyed them. The chopped nuts weren't well embedded and as a result, scattered all over, in the packaging and on the floor."
2,"I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors."
2,"The product inside the can is very good. I use it for cooking.<br />The packaging is inadequate. Half of the cans arrived severely dented. I opened the most mis-shapen can and saw no breach in the seal of the container; so I still used it despite misgivings.<br /> I saw that Amazon does not accept return of this canned product. Also I got no request for feedback except as to the adequacy of the packaging, so I feel they must be aware of the faulty and inadequate packaging.<br /> Roland Coconut Milk, Organic, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)"
2,"I was hoping this would be good and really wanted to like it... was kind of like eating wax... I prefer a more bitter and deeper chocolate flavor.  I enjoy the taste of dark chocolate.  This bar seemed to be trying to mask the flavor of chocolate so much that there was nothing left.  sadly disapointed.  I like some of other sugar free chocolates, while more bitter, they are better."
2,"I know this was supposed to be some great funny movie, but I just didn't get it. It started off OK, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were fine, but it just got boring. I couldn't see the point of the movie, even in retrospect. Why make this movie? Plus, the Michael Keaton character was so annoying, I just wanted to go away. I know he was supposed to be annoying, so fine, he did a good job with that, but I don't want to have to listen to it. We watched as a family and my 8-year-old son hated it too. My husband liked it. Maybe it's a guy thing, a grown-up guy thing."
2,"Well I have been taking this product for a week now. The first time I took it, WOW!!! I had a lot of energy. I felt as if I was never going to get off the treadmill. I was able to run on a high number speed for miles. It kind of wore off when I went to go workout with some free weights. This was after about 45 mins. Well then I took it again the next day but this time there was no burst of energy. I am still taking it and it's sad to say I do not get that energy anymore like the first time. Perhaps it works different for everyone but I will not be buying this again"
2,"I tried using these to write script on a fondant ""book"" page.  I had to write part of a letter, close the pen and shake it downwards, write another part, repeat.  They seemed to not flow smoothly, even with dry fondant (not sweating).  I won't use these again."
2,"I just want to preface this review by noting that I do stop into Starbucks and get flavored coffees (current favorite, Peppermint Mocha, whipped cream on top). So I had positive expectations of a vanilla flavored coffee. Unfortunately, this was among the worst Starbucks blends I've ever tasted. Just to give it a fair shot, I tried brewing and drinking it four different ways:<br /><br />1.Mild with no sugar or cream<br />2. Strong with no sugar or cream<br />3. Mild with sugar and cream<br />4. Strong with sugar and cream<br /><br />I also had friends taste test this. We all hated it. We couldn't choke it down as it was truly bitter and unpleasant. Maybe we got a bad batch or bag. At this point, we have nearly a whole bag left and I'm feeling guilty about wasting it. But there is no way I'm going to brew another pot of coffee and try to create a tasty brew. I tend to like my coffee extremely strong but even making it overly strong did not make it better. Yes, the vanilla flavor came through but it wasn't a good addition to a possibly decent coffee (without the vanilla)."
2,"My 8 month old has eaten nearly on the flavors of ellas, happy baby/tot, and sprout meals.  This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang."

2,"The item came in a reasonable time, so I was happy about that. The package was completely damaged and falling apart, which could have been the postal services fault. The product had expired almost a month prior. The item seems like a really good one in which I hope to try and have a better experience next time."
2,"These just aren't very good.  They taste rather plastic, and don't have very much taste to them at all."
2,"Wow, eat a few and you're fine.  Eat a half of handful and you'll be ""popping"" in a few hours.  Eat a handful or more and you better stay near a bathroom for the rest of the day.  These taste great just like the regular ones, but they'll affect you in more ways than one ;)."
2,"If I wanted unprocessed unsweetened cherries, dates, and almonds, I would eat them all individually, not mashed up and packaged up in a bar.  These taste terrible.  2 stars for being healthy, but tasting awful."
2,"this bag was the size of a small envelope. please don't buy it,its way to over priced. and i live in California so they were melted by the time i got them."
2,"I expected better. Flavor is o.k. But half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave."
2,"I paid for 100 k cups but received only 98! This is the second time this has happened.I didn't think such about it the first time. Now I wonder if this happens often or even all the time."
2,"I REALLY like the taste of this coffee! My only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee. Not a huge fan of that and even though I really like the taste of it I will not order again, bummer!! =("
2,"This cream is more for normal to oily skin rather then dry/mature skin.  It goes on nicely and gets absorbed quickly.  It leaves a nice smooth feel on your skin like the more expensive creams do.  However this cream has an overpowering sweet jasmine smell.  The smell does not fade.  People will only smell your face cream.  This could be used as face cream/cheap perfume. I thought I can get used to the smell but it's too strong and rather unpleasent."
2,"I love Lu products.. but these came melted with each two stuck together and the taste was average.<br /><br />My problems may have been due to shipping in hot weather."
2,"We love Clif kid Z bars.  I decided to try these based on all of the great reviews.  We bought the strawberry and no one in the house likes them.  My kids are picky, so I always try the treats just to see if they are even worth trying.  I eat healthy and don't mind most healthy snacks, but even I did not care for these.  I am going to try another flavor, but the strawberry just didn't cut it here!"
2,"It is hard to review products like these because results are very dependant on each person's physiology and are also subjective.  I don't think anyone who has said they've had great success with this product is lying, nor do I think those that have said they've had little success are lying.  As such this is a product you have to try to see what happens for you.<br /><br />I am not a huge consumer of energy products, but I do like to them from time to time.  My standard has been Rockstar Zero Carb (i.e. no sugar) which is a full size energy drink.  I have found that it works well and usually I don't need to drink the entire can.  The appeal of 5-hour Energy is its small size and easy storage.  I don't drink Rockstar for it's outstanding taste, so if I can get the energy in something smaller and easier to consume, why not try?<br /><br />I first tried 1/2 a bottle of 5-hour Energy as some of the reviews made me a bit wary of how I might react.  I found that 1/2 bottle had almost no effect.  On a different day I tried the entire bottle and again I saw almost no effect.  It is possible that there was a slight pickup, but nothing that would make this product worth buying.  I find this a bit strange because the ingredients and amounts appear to be more than what is found in the Rockstar Zero Carb mentioned above.  As such I would expect at least the same level of energy pickup, but again that wasn't close to being the case.<br /><br />I am not going to throw in the towel just yet, however.  I plan to try the ""extra strength"" version of this product to see if that yields a better result.  For now though, while I cannot personally recommend this product based on my own results, I think each person will have to try and see for themselves.<br /><br />Update: I tried the ""extra strength"" version of this product.  I took the entire bottle and found little to no difference between this and the ""regular"" version.  Since the regular version, as mentioned above, had pretty much no effect on me, I don't plan to buy anymore of this product."
2,"I tried to eat this with some saltine crackers, which i like to do with most seafood. But the taste was just how can i put this....disgusting. This ""might"" be good for crab cakes but eating as is didn't go well for me.<br />If you notice its very cheap compared to Crown Prince Crab Meat and believe me there is a very good reason. This crab meat is imported from Singapore."
2,"I bought two of these directly from AeroGardens.  One with the salad greens and one with the tomatoes.  I've had them for 32 days now, and the greens are about 2"" tall and the tomatoes show one tomato plant that is no more than 1/4"" high.  I called to do an RMA.  I have hydronic (infloor) heating, set at 64 degrees, which is very uniform and should not have caused my AeroGrows to fail.  I checked the pH and TDS and found that they are way out of whack from what they should be for acceptable levels.  I will be building my own hydroponic systems for far less money after this experiment.  I am glad I got these on the trial basis which allows you to return them if not satisfied.  These may work well in a warmer environment but in the long run, they will not outperform other systems that you can build cheaper and bigger.  To the company's credit, they are paying for the return shipping so I am only out the initial shipping (about $30)."
2,"I am not a huge mixed drink person. I prefer a hearty beer or a tasty wine to a liquor concoction. However, I was willing to try this moctail that Crystal Light puts out. I have tried in my past their traditional stuff, the lemonade standard, and always thought it was on the very sweet and very tangy side. To me that same taste is still present in their Mojita style moctail. It seems to have a hint of mint and maybe something else to give it a ""liquor"" flavor. But overall I don't like it.<br /><br />It probably would be ok if you actually mixed it with alcohol, but I am guessing Crystal Light is not purporting those kinds of mixology outside of just water. They have other flavors, but this is not begging me to try others or even finish up the remaining packets. The artificiality of the flavor does not lend itself to a refreshing taste with that aspartame flavor on the tongue.<br /><br />As far as packaging goes, it comes in a standard plastic little container, each with 4 packets. The back of the item says ""sugar free"", however, if you read the ingredients, it clearly states ""sugar"". But then with a disclaimer that says ""adds a trivial amount of sugar"". Whats that about? Either it is or is not sugar free. Dont make a claim that clearly goes against it! Not to mention sugar is probably better for you than aspartame.<br /><br />A single serving is 8 ounces which is 5 calories. The entire container serves 40 while 1/8 of a packet serves 1 person or 1.1 grams. So basically, each package can serve 8, while there are 5 packets, that will give you your 40.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars for its ease of making a drink. One can easily control the amount of water to ""flavor-down"" the taste, but I am not willing to experiment enough to find that ""taste"" in something that is only ok. The second star for the potential if you wanted to use it with alcohol to make a drink for yourself. Which might be ok as an accent to something else, but not as its dominant flavor. Maybe Sandra Lee would find use for it, but I am not inspired."
2,"I'm an avid K cup user - coffee, tea, cocoa - and have my favorites and not-so-favorites, but dang... This one started off tasting okay, but actually gave me indigestion (burp!). There's a disturbing metallic, cloyingly sweet aftertaste in my mouth too. Your mileage may vary, but this is one K cup flavor I won't be revisiting."
2,"Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the ""old"" (with BPA) or the ""new"" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the ""old"" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!"
2,"I agree with the other reviews that said this did not have enough spice, not at all.  I mean when I buy a chocolate that has chili in it, I expect it to have a kick, but this had no spice or even a little bit of a kick to it.  It just tasted like chocolate.  If you want a good chocolate bar with chili that you can actually taste then I would suggest ""Chuao Chocolate Bar: Spicy Maya""  It is so good and amazing!!!  Dont get me wrong, this is a great chocolate but dont expect a chili kick to it."
2,"This turkey jerky is good in the fact that it is preservative-free, no MSG, no nitrates and all-natural.  But, I was disappointed - it's too dry and difficult to eat.  Not a great pleasure to the mouth, but okay in general."
2,"The cookies taste like the cake snack called Devil Dogs.  They're very dry.  It's probably what chocolate dirt sprinkled with chocolate chips would taste like.  If you like Devil Dogs then you'll probably like these cookies."
2,"I think the concept is great but my Weimaraner destroyed it the first day! He pulled out the plug and chewed it up! He swallowed pieces and ended up vomiting. So I had quite the mess to clean up! I was hoping it would last a bit longer and keep him occupied while I was at work. I wanted a refund or to exchange for a different item but the company would only replace it! Which doesn't help! So now he can only play with it while i am sitting with him and watching him. So don't get it if your pup likes to chew at all."
2,"Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.  They're also made by Wellness.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9GNPM"">Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog Biscuits</a> Or, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L80MZ2"">Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce</a>"
2,"Well wanted to make sure friend got some Pepper Jack Cheese and was in a rush. Found out I can find a larger size product of cheese for half the cost I paid for this. So make sure not to impulse buy food.  You can get it for less and pay no shipping charges though the fact they said two made me think wow what a bargin. Friend got it and told me he pays less for more at Costco so live and learn. Cheese tasted great though."
2,"This review pertains to the Black Silk only. If you are thinking of skimping on your next K-Cup purchase, read this.<br /><br />No surprise, but you get what you pay for. While many of the other brands of K-Cups say ""100% Arabica Coffee"" on the side of the package, these merely say, ""100% Coffee"" - so you know there's gotta be some Robusta in there somewhere. I'd say the flavor is OK if you enjoy the free coffee at your local car dealership while waiting for a repair. Maybe even a step up to ""diner coffee."" Not terrible, but definitely leaves a burned aftertaste in your mouth. These were OK to try, but I would spend the extra pennies for better quality K-Cups in the future."
2,"I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else."
2,"We purchased this on Amazon because we have never found it locally.  Ideally I would have purchased far less than 10 pounds but it is the only size sold on Amazon.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted the packaging was horrific.  We inadvertently opened the bottom of the box.  Inside was a very thin plastic bag - similar to those one finds wrapped around clothing at the dry cleaners.  We tried to carefully pull the bag out of the box but couldn't find the top - was it sealed or tied ?  Of course, it was neither - it is just an open bag!  Half the shells poured into the cardboard box.  Finally got them back into the giant bag and the cardboard box didn't look so good - it had light stains as though it may have gotten wet somewhere in its journey from origin to home.  This is NOT a very appetizing way to receive food.  I wonder if this is a safe plastic.  Sadly, it looks like someone tossed a giant pile of pasta into a trash bag.<br /><br />The photo on Amazon's site is the appealing bright yellow box; it would certainly be far nicer to have these individually packaged.<br /><br />At least the pasta is very good tasting.  All of the De Boles we've tried are similar - very tasty but one needs to watch carefully when cooking.  Al dente is our preference and these cook more quickly than standard pasta.<br /><br />As far as Dr. Oz's endorsement I am skeptical.  This product is not purely Jerusalem artichoke - it also contains wheat flour;  his show stated that one doesn't get the sugar highs and lows but we feel like we do.<br /><br />The De Boles spaghetti that we find locally is very expensive compared to other products so it would be nice to determine exactly how much jerusalem artichoke flour is used and exactly what the glycemic impact is upon one's body."
2,"I used it with dual boiler Bezzera and also with Moka pot. Neither taste nor crema was good. This is like paying BMW money and getting most basic VW."
2,"I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl."
2,"I'm a little surprised at the rave reviews here.  We tried this mix and it was ridiculously over-spiced.  Even my s.o., who generally likes intense Italian spices, thought it was was way over-doing it.  The texture wasn't really great either - I don't know if we made a mistake somehow, but it was very dense.  We ended up using some of this mix to bread some Italian Parmesan chicken - it worked pretty well for that, at least!"
2,"I was so excited to receive these K-cups and had one today. I wasn't very impressed. It tasted watered down and I had to add Stevia and sugar free creamer to make it taste half way decent to drink. I like a stronger tasting coffee and these just don't cut it. I'm giving both boxes to my daughter-in-law. I knew I should have ordered only one box to try first. Oh well...live and learn. I cancelled my subscribe and save too."
2,"My big puppy is not impressed. He'll ignore a palm-full and go about his business. Maybe he just isn't big on peanut butter flavor stuff."
2,"I bought this because my legs and ankles had been swollen badly for over a week and this is not normal for me.  Dandelion leaf tea is supposed to be a diuretic, but I've been drinking it for a couple days and there is no difference that I can tell.<br /><br />When steeped for 12 minutes per the directions for medicinal use the flavor is very ""grassy"" and rather bitter.  I expected the bitter part from the dandelion leaves, but the grassy flavor is a bit hard to take unless I mix it with other teas, drinking twice as much to get the proper dosage of the dandelion.  I tried adding a little bit of honey in the straight tea to cut the grassy taste but I wound up with too sweet plus bitter.<br /><br />I then bought a couple bunches of fresh parsley and made tea from it.  Cost:  around $2 for enough tea for almost two weeks.  However, you won't need to drink parsley tea for more than 2 days at most to have all that excess fluid removed from your body.  It works:  It's cheap; It's natural, and no paper bags to dispose of! One note:  Parsley tea doesn't taste all that great either but you can add other kinds of tea to help the flavor.<br /><br />Save your money... go to your local grocery store and get the parsley."
2,"This has a very, very strong taste - almost like licorice (?) which I don't like. If you put honey in tea or something similar, it will flavor it noticeably. It's difficult for me to even want to use it because of how the taste stays with me. But it is a very smooth consistency and it hasn't sugared in the time I have had it (several months)."
2,"I found these finally and was quite disappointed. They are OK at best, nothing like potato chips though.."
2,"Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash has a nice lather and feel to it and my skin felt clean and smooth after using it. However, a few minutes after drying off, my skin began to itch.  I also didn't care much for the heavy fragrance which tends to last."
2,"I have the 8ounce popcorn machine with kettle. I have used 10 packs of the popcorn out of the 24 pack case. The taste of the popcorn is great, but at least 25% of the popcorn does not pop. The kernel cather is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch. I will try other brands because to Me that is just too much unpopped kernels."
2,"This is the first brand of Honeybush tea I've tried.  I do not taste ""sweet"" at all!  And yes you can brew this tea too strong!!!  And to me, it IS a bit bitter!  So I don't know what people talk about when they say it has a honey taste...I don't taste honey.  Tastes very twiggy/grassy to me....<br /><br />Will try another brand."
2,"Waaaay too sweet.<br />And it's all mostly bad kinds of sugars, too.<br />You may as well grab a handful of cashews and down it with a packet of sugar."
2,"This flavor is the only kind of pouch my baby girl likes. I used to order the 3.5 pouch. now she's 14 months old, I decided to order the bigger pouch.. However.. they sent me the 3.5 ounce pouch instead. I didn't bother to return it and order again... I thought people make mistakes sometimes. But I see other reviewers having the same problem... I hope they send me the right one this time because I just ordered.. if not... I would think they are doing this on purpose.. and they have a problem."
2,"My daughter got a sample of this coffee in her starter pack and raved about it so I bought a box.  The coffee tastes great but out of the five cups I've made so far, two broke open and spewed coffee grounds into my cup and made a real mess.  The one I'm drinking now.....I used a paper towel to try to remove quite a few grounds from the cup so I wouldn't have to throw out three cups of coffee.  This has never happened to me with any other K-cups.<br /><br />I'll stick with Green Mountain Double Black Diamond from now on.  It's great coffee without the mess.<br /><br />Hey Emeril, see what you can do to fix this problem.  I imagine you've lost more than one customer because of it."
2,"The instructions on the bag are WRONG: If you follow the directions, you won't get 5 servings! Plus it doesn't ""magically turn purple"" but a pale bluish-gray that looks like the stuff Luke Skywalker had for breakfast with his aunt & uncle before he went off to find Old Ben Kenobi"
2,"After reading the rave reviews, I was very disappointed.  The kippers were broken into pieces, overly salty.  I would not recommend them."
2,"This is not real Mesa De Los Santos coffee. It came in a silver bag with a printed lable.  Not the original packaging from the company which comes in a gold bag explaining history about the product, certified label, etc.  This is FAKE."
2,"Had to use twice as much of this as Medaglia D Oro to obtain the same strength. If you like Columbian, then maybe this is for you."
2,"I bought these recently, they don't expire until November so at least they aren't old.  However, when I opened them and gave one to each of my golden retrievers, they just dropped them.  If they have no choice of another treat, they will eat these, but otherwise, they wait for something better.  Won't buy again since they aren't popular here."
2,"Be forewarned!I did not know this product would be so salty. I usually get the lower sodium type of Better N' Peanut Butter (not that it is low in salt, at 85 mg.) and was used to that. This one tastes like salt and little else to me."
2,"When I opened the case I found 4 cans were so deeply dented that I was afraid to feed them to my cat.  Otherwise this seems like OK food, my cat east it.  Weird that the price on Amazon went up so dramatically; I would not pay over a dollar a can for this.  I am hoping Amazon will replace the damaged product, but it doesn't seem as easy to lodge a complaint with Amazon as it used to..."
2,"There is no way I will ever buy Maple Syrup in a Plastic<br />or other bottle where you cannot see the contents.<br /><br />Maple Syrup can spoil and if you have a clear container<br />you will be able to see the mold and avoid consuming<br />the spoiled goods."
2,"I bought a couple of these 4-packs, but about 50% of the crusts came already torn into two or three pieces.  Another unrelated 50% smell REALLY bad but have no visible mold or anything.  Some of them are just fine though.  Also, refrigerating them immediately after receipt did not help.<br /><br />I prefer Boboli pizza crusts.  I can buy both brands locally, but Boboli is easier to find and because the back side of the packaging is fully transparent, it is easier to check for damage before buying."
2,"The product is good... a nice way to get soda out of your diet!  Tastes good (sometimes I add a bit of lime).<br /><br />I pay about 9 bucks less for the same amount at Kroger.  I don't know why it is so overpriced here."
2,"But this product had an after taste hard to describe. It was something on the order of a bitter, metallic taste. At first sip, the chocolate taste came through along with the coffee. Then this nasty after taste spoiled it. I regularly buy Wendy's Jamocha shake, add chocolate to my coffee, and like coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup. So its not the basic flavor that seems to be the fault. Possibly something is wrong with the container or the coffee is bitter."
2,"I don't know what it was about this Emeril's big easy blend, if perhaps there was a hint of chicory, but I really did not enjoy this style of coffee people k cup whatsoever. Something was just off about it. I would try other flavors instead."
2,"Being on a low carb diet, I was anxious to try these ""miracle noodles"", so I ordered 10 pkgs of the angel hair pasta. Upon opening my first package, I realized that 1/2 of the ""7 oz"" was the watery solution they were packed in.. meaning that one whole package would feed only one adult... we might say expensive to feed two, or three people.  I followed the directions to a ""T"" to remove the fishy odor, and to dry them out before adding my low carb marinara sauce. I also TRIED to cut the noodles in half to shorten their length, and to try and unglue the tangled mess, which was almost impossible to do!  After my first bite.. I was pulling these jelly noodles from inbetween my teeth, but worst of all..... I found them almost impossible to swallow, as they stuck to the back of my throat like jellied rubberbands.  I had no problem with them being tasteless, but the amount of time you have to spend rinsing, drying, sauteeing (to dry out more), the fact they are a tangled mess of glob, then to almost choke when trying to swallow them is just too much!  I MAY give the ""rice"" noodles a chance, but I'll never buy the angel hair again.  I had to throw the rest away because my husband couldn't chew, or swallow them well either.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055DXIPG"">Shirataki Miracle Noodles -Angel Hair (198g) No Carbs! Made with Konjac Glucomannan Brand: Miracle Noodles</a>"
2,"Like others have said it is very weak. I would mix it in with something else but it might cut the pumpkin spice and that part actually tastes ok. It does say on the top of the K-cup ""light roast coffee"" (but not on Amazon description that I could find) so buyer beware."
2,"I really thought I would like this tea, but I ended up giving it away. I like white teas, but I like green even more. I also generally like raspberry, but this combo didn't work for me. I won't buy it again."
2,"Did not have much peanut butter taste.  There were peanuts that were fine. Guess I was expecting a stronger taste."
2,"The taste is very bad. Its very very oily and the bhindies are totally mashed and mixed with the curry. I could never finish one packet at a time."
2,"I first started using Zipfizz about 2-3 years ago and enjoyed during that time period HOWEVER, I don't know if they changed something in the formula or what but now I cannot drink it without side effects. It use to give me the extra kick and energy I needed... through the morning... another through the afternoon. RECENTLY though when I drink just a small amount I get 'VERTIGO' which will last for a few days, actually causing me to miss 2 days of work. I fell ok when I am sitting or lying down, but when I stand I am dizzy and it lasts for days. Also, the muscles in the back and on the side of my neck ache, directly behind and below the back of my ears. This is still an after effect that has lasted since I first experienced this. After initially having the dizziness effect, a month later I wanted to put my theory to the test so I bought another box from my local Costco and took just a few drinks and AGAIN the same effects occurred causing me miss work. NOW I HAVE NEW INFORMATION - My 24 yr old son ( who occasionally would use Zipfizz ) has reported the same effect with his latest use of the product. This leads me to believe they have changed something... or there was ONE HUGE BAD BATCH of the stuff made somewhere. Draw your own conclusions, just my experience. Thanks, Don"
2,"I love brown rice, I love rice noodles and I love vermicelli so I figured this product would be something I'd really enjoy.<br />I'm disappointed.  The noodles are bland and straw like.  As others have noted the instructions/recipe on package are lacking in depth and clarity.  Just soaking doesn't create a nice pasta texture, but actually cooking them turns them into clumpy/mushy mess.  If you are looking for a gluten free substitute for wheat pasta to soak up the flavors of a great sauce this might work for you."
2,"Unlike some of the others who complained about a poor selection, my purchase featured a wide variety of attractive flavors. Unfortunately I will not be able to try them all because many are dented and crushed, causing some of them to come open in transit. Unfortunate and disappointing. Packaging them in a brown paper bag might not have been the best idea."
2,"It's a challenge to review food, since so much of it is a matter of taste.  Although I think some people will like this granola a lot, it wasn't for me.<br /><br />This is a high-quality granola, flavored with cocoa and coconut, with chunks of dark chocolate and freeze dried strawberries and berries.  The texture is excellent, and contrasts well with milk or yogurt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I thought there was way too much chocolate.  The dominant flavor is cocoa, followed by the oats, then the chunks of chocolate.  The berries are pretty sparse, and I couldn't detect the coconut.  As I said, it might be right for some people, but I found the cocoa aftertaste to be offputting and am not a fan."
2,"I bought Columela because it had gotten such praise from other reviewers and on other websites.  I did a blind taste test of the Columela against my favorite olive oil from O&Co, which is, admittedly, somewhat more expensive.  I did not like the Columela.  My bottle does not have a fruity taste.  Instead, it is somewhat bitter, and I found the taste somewhat unpleasant.  I would much rather pay a little more and get a much tastier oil from O&Co."
2,"I love Popchips. However, I did not like this flavor at all. The garlic flavor was too intense."
2,"The fudge melts easily, too easily, but unfortunately that doesn't equate to good tasting chocolate fudge, if that's even a proper description of the mild flavored chocolate outer coating. The graham cracker cookie has a very weak graham cracker flavor. The cookie is made of crumbs and isn't very crunchy. Freezing them doesn't help much either. Lots of sugar (9g per 3 cookies) and lots of fat (7g, or 1/2 tablespoon per 3 cookies). I ate them, they are still cookies :), but I won't buy them again."
2,"Of all the coffee beans I have gotten through Amazon I'd have to say that this has been my least favorite.  The flavor is flat for my taste and reminds me of just plain old commercial grade coffee.  Unfortunate because I was looking so forward to receiving it.  I much prefer the Organic Cafe Altura Dark for this style of roast.<br />Oh well, I tried..."
2,"I returned this product because the bag was open when I received the package. I was very disappointed because I really wanted this product for my cats."
2,"This product has too much vanilla as others have stated.  It's not truly a Hazelnut coffee, but a blended vanilla hazelnut combo. I will not be purchasing this again."
2,"I won the Beaba from a blog giveaway, but I don't think I would ever spend the money to buy one.  I only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend.<br /><br />It did everything it was advertised to do.  I don't think it saves on time and effort, though.  You still have to clean, peel, and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks, so no time saved there.  If anything it takes MORE time to prepare baby food with the Beaba simply because it has such a small capacity.  You can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer, which seems like a good amount of food.  However, by the time you steam and puree your food, you end up with only about half a cup of baby food, maybe a bit more.<br /><br />Let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes.  Always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy.  The Beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time.  I can cook four LARGE sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7-cup food processor all at once.  With the Beaba, start to finish, from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling, you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby.  Also, food coming out of the Beaba is EXTREMELY hot, rightly so, but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool, which just adds to your food prep time.<br /><br />Anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in BULK.  Most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the Beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time.  Just one hour  in the kitchen on Sunday and I had enough baby food to last all week, if not longer.  I have a KitchenAid 7-cup food processor which I found on sale at BB&B for around sixty bucks.  I would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave, then puree them quickly in the food processor, usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time.<br /><br />Also, one pot, one steamer basket, and one food processor was MUCH easier to clean than the Beaba.  The Beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time I used it and I didn't care for all the little parts and pieces I needed to clean on the Beaba.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers.  Gladware makes small 4-ounce containers.  I believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks.  I would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer.  Each night before I went to bed, I would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day.  Come mealtime, it was fast and easy to scoop out what I needed and warm it up in the microwave.<br /><br />After several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the Gladware containers would crack, but they're so affordable that I didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set."
2,"I purchased this thinking it might be a replacement for the FIrst Colony Sumatran which is currently unavailable.  Pretty disappointing in the flavor department; it has a flavor mildly reminiscent of Folgers - not as bad as Folgers, but not representative of a good Sumantran."
2,"Don't if they changed it,but it did not taste like the first time I ordered it,don't know what they did to it?"
2,"When I first started ordering this product on Amazon I received damaged cans - every single can on the wrapped pallet of twelve cans was dented so I know it didn't happen during shipping.  The food was also dry so I stopped ordering the product after receiving two shipments of poor quality product.  After getting reminder notices to reorder I decided to give it another try a few months later.  The quality was excellent and the food was really moist and fresh - perfect, my cats loved it!  After receiving about four good quality product shipments, the fifth one that I currently received is back to being dry and chunky instead of moist and creamy and my cats won't eat it.  How can the product be that inconsistent???  Very disappointed."
2,"I LOVE THE QUICK SIMPLE GREAT TASTE OF STARBUCKS IN AN INSTANT. BUT THEY CAME UP WITH THE LOUSY ELONGATED AND SKINNY PACKETS. THEY ARE HARD TO HOLD, DIFFICULT TO EASILY OPEN AND WHEN YOU HAVE HOT WATER IN A CUP--THE STEAM CLOGS THE NARROW OPENING OF THE PACKET MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO POUR IN YOUR CUP.. WHY CANT STARBUCKS PUT IT INTO A WIDE PACKET LIKE EQUAL OR SWEET AND LOW? GREAT PRODUCT--DUMB PACKAGING."
2,"All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadn't :(  It's been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  They're just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good!"
2,"Normally we use Florida's Crystals Organic sugar in the plastic jugs.  We were nearly out of sugar & decided to order 6 bags of this sugar since we were in a pinch.  When it arrived & I opened the box (light as a feather was my first warning), I was floored.  The bags were flat not filled like the picture.  They are the exact same bags Davidson's uses for most of their bulk teas.  However they are not filled.<br /><br />Okay, it says it's a 16 ounce bag.  If I wasn't on a organic sugar shortage I may have paid more attention.  You are paying for 2 Cups of sugar!  That's it.  Think about it.  Not only that but extreme waste in packaging.  I think the bags could hold 4 times the amount of sugar.  It's a shame I didn't think to take a picture of those paper thin bags of ""bulk"" sugar.<br /><br />The final insult was the mess it was to get the sugar out of the bags.  It stuck to the sides & in the creases.  Trying to get it out of those spots left the counter & floor with a fine coat of sugar.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars over 1 because the sugar is organic & at least that is something.  There is nothing special about it. If this is the only choice I have for organic sugar, I will settle on this, but I will not be happy - at all."
2,"If there is no wholesome food available, this could do.  However, this is high in salt, low in fiber, high in carbohydrates (tastes like sweet candy), and uses highly processed ground turkey.  Even gourmet pet food offers real chunks of meat.  This is supposed to be for advanced babies, but it's mushy with bits of ground turkey and corn kernel peels.  It would be good to see more WHOLE bits of food, less salt, less sweetness, more fiber, and cuts of real meat (not highly processed ground mystery turkey) with more meat.  It is healthier for me to use frozen vegetables with meat than this Sprout concoction.  They get two stars for trying to be organic."
2,"I was really excited to try these cookies because I really love Oreos.  After reading rave reviews, I went out and got a package of them from Whole Foods.  Maybe it's the fact that I have just recently been diagnosed as Celiac (1 month ago) and the amazing taste of real Oreos is fresh in my mind, but these just don't do it for me.  They taste nothing like real Oreos and probably have more in common with a Hydrox cookie.  If you are on a GF diet, you can eat these and pretend they are Oreos, but you have to have a strong imagination, because they leave a LOT to be desired.  I'd much rather do without (or make some home-made GF oreo cookies)."
2,"Typical of the US food industry, they have to pack the product full of salt.  By the time you you get the saltiness diluted out all the flavor is diluted out."
2,"Expected dried silvery little fish (1 to 2 inch) that I've found before and that both cats liked.  These are yellowed pieces that appear to be explosively vacuum dried.  Texture is different. One cat eats them but the other won't touch them."
2,"It was not the same product pictured. I was specifically looking for that product. I am slightly disappointed. It didn't taste as I had expected either."
2,"This popcorn is rather bland. I purchased it because generally I like Newman's own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless. I would not buy again."
2,"I ordered this prouct along with 2 others. I bought all together to get the ""FREE SHIPPING over $30"". What really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and I was charged seperate shipping for each. The shipping was such that I could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store. I feel I was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by Amazon. This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time."
2,"After all the hype and my needing my sweets to come a little healthier I finally gave in and bought this assortment.  I was disappointed.  Of all the flavors I only liked the rootbeer drops and the spicy mango & spicy lime suckers.  I kind of liked the sour apple but there was only ONE.  Lemon, ginger and watermelon were just okay but the lemon was the only true tasting of the latter three.  Several flavors were just unpleasant (or had an off aftertaste i.e. blueberry) and it was strange how there were the most of those flavors..quite the over-abundance in fact.<br /><br />Most were either too tangy/sour, bland or I didn't like the ""off"" flavor.  The drops are so tiny, You have to eat several to take care of a craving.<br /><br />After 3 teenagers and I tried every flavor and finished off the 3 favorites the rest are sitting in the box untouched and won't be finished for a long time.<br /><br />I guess I'm the odd man out for not liking these (looking at all the high ratings that sucked me into buying these things in the first place...) but it's an honest opinion.  I won't be repurchasing."
2,"MY wife and kids ate them.  I asked, and they said that they were not soft or chewy.  They were hard and crumbly.  On the plus side, they were generous with the chocolate.  My wife tried microwaving them, eating them at room temperature, and even refrigerating them to try to make them chewy, but nothing seemed to work."
2,"I've bought this product before in the 20 bag per box size and always loved it.  This time, however, the tea was practically tasteless.  I think it probably has to do with the packaging, the tea bags are not individually wrapped.  Buy the 20 teabag size instead."
2,"I bought this tea at Stop and Shop and it clearly has warnings on it but I didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. I don't fancy the flavor of this tea.  Yogi makes a sampler with this one in it."
2,"I was so excited to get these cookies from the vine program.  I had seen the commericals on t.v., and I thought they looked yummy.  When I received the cookies, a lot of them were broken and/or stuck together.  The ""gooey"" aspect wasn't gooey but one big chip  of chocolate in the middle.  To me, they were too sweet and not the best quality of chocolate.  I am not a huge fan of the original, but I prefer them to this new cookie.  I would not buy these, but on a side note, my four year old and two year old seemed to like them."
2,"I just received my shipment, and I was so excited to try it.  I poured my hot water in, took a sip, and BLEH!  Yuck.  I came on the website to blast this hot chocolate and give it a poor review, but then read some of the reviews that mention how it NEEDS TO BE MADE WITH MILK.  I didn't even read the instructions, because I've always used water in any other h.c. mixes I've bought.  I remade it with milk, which made it better, but I still like Stephens hot cocoa more.  It's delicious & creamy & you can make it w/water.  I'm definitely going back to Stephens."
2,"I tried this as a break from heavy lunches.  I found it really nasty. The flavor powder clumps up, no matter how vigorously you stir the mess, and the beans stay a bit too hard.  The final texture is like maple syrup with lumps.  The flavor is horrid -- dried something, but no resemblance to any food I've had (and homemade black bean soup is a favorite).  This seems to be a product devised by someone who considers food only a nutrient object, not a potential source of joy in life. I cannot recommend this to anyone who has taste buds."
2,"I like the single-serving bags, and this is the second batch of JtC rounds I've bought, but they certainly aren't my favorite snack.<br /><br />They are crunchy, and have a decent texture, but they're saltier than I'd prefer.  They're what I reach for when I want something salty, or when I'm just bored with the rest of the snacks on hand.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can tell a difference between the Nacho flavor rounds and the ""plain"" ones."
2,"Warning: this is a STRONG flavor.<br /><br />I thought that this would be Blue Mountain-y... oh no. It is like... rum flavored or something. Yuk."
2,"I love bold/extra bold k-cups, but unlike some other choices this one was intense, bitter, and far too strong for my palate. I'm really surprised I didn't like this one since I have yet to find an extra bold k-cup that I didn't like.<br /><br />Some other choices I enjoy, in case you also found this way too strong:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQ0OS0"">Timothy's World Coffee Rainforest Extra Bold Espresso K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6DM0"">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Organic Espresso Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y8Y"">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY"">Newman's Own Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>"
2,"I didn't think the All Natural Original Wafers were as good as the ones that can be found on sale in most stores selling candy bars.  They advertised 7 flavors--I found lemon, licorice, clove, wintergreen and chocolate. The colors were pale so that most of the time there was no difference in color between the clove and lemon, licorice or chocolate. Mostly I steer clear of ""new and improved"" but in this case I'll stick with it. I wanted to try them, and I appreciate Amazon.com giving me the opportunity to try them.  As always, their service was outstanding--5 stars."
2,"This almond milk tastes great! It has a great flavor that is similar to cow's milk with a nutty flavor. If I think the taste is so great then why don't I give it a better rating? Unfortunately, there is no calcium in this un-enriched version so I can't really use it as a milk substitute for my children. When I can find an enriched version on Amazon, I will definitely renew my Subscribe and Save for that one."
2,"I didn't think the flavor was strong or distinctive enough. A pretty inoffensive tea, but after being spoiled by Tazo's Teas, it's hard to look at a tea like this the same way."
2,"I bought a small buster cube for my 15lb furry mutt and he had a great time....until the inner cylinder popped off and the bottom half of his mouth got stuck in the hole. I was able to pry it off after he stopped yelping but it'd cut up his lip quite a bit. Oh, and this was his first time playing with the toy."
2,"I decided to buy these samosas and try them out. However I was disappointed that they lacked some essential spices and tasted bland. In addition, I paid $33 for 6 boxes, which came out $5.50 per box. Today, I went to my local Indian grocery store, and they were selling it for $2.99 per box."
2,"I drank two cups of each flavor, coming to the conclusion that this is unremarkable tea.  You can barely tell the difference between flavors.  It's not bad and I'll drink all six boxes I got in the bundle but I won't buy it again."
2,"The wrapping on this gum is very frustrating and hard to get a piece of gum out.<br />When you finally get it out, the flavor does not last at all."
2,"I was very excited to receive arctic zero but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations.  I completely agree with another reviewer that said it tastes like a frozen protein shake...which isnt bad mind you but not worth the price in my opinion.  I am not interested in eating the pints right from the freezer with a spoon but they  do make a tasty breakfast when mixed with shake mix ins like fruit, milk, ice, cocoa, pb2 etc.  Its not offensive at all, just not delicious and yummy.  I like large portions and I'm health conscious ..so the volumetrics way of eating appeals to me... but in this case, I'd rather have a 1/2 cup of light ice cream than a pint of arctic zero.  Great concept but I will never crave it.  Unlikely I would buy again.  Sorry. BTW I never wrote an Amazon review before but I felt compelled to do so."
2,"What good is nutrition if your body is on the verge of puking? This is my first time eating Black Bean and Lime. I had tried Dr.McDougall's curry and Pad Thai; both are better tasting than this. BBL almost made me puke because of the taste, and some of the flavor blend didn't dissolve, rather it became a paste, a rather disgusting paste."
2,"First, it tastes OK, though slightly lacking compared to the real thing. But it's 90% of the full effect. How we lost that 10% is rather important though.<br /><br />This is what happens when an American conglomerate buys a little British company. The first thing they did was rehash the recipe to see where it could be made cheaper without anyone noticing, so they substituted spirit vinegar and high fructose corn syrup. The first just removes flavor, the second is implicated in health issues since fructose appears to interfere with lysl oxidase which is important in collagen and elastin production. The amount you get from this product is small, but avoiding every bit of it you can is important."
2,"I shop on both sides of the Canada/U.S. border for groceries. I am faithful to brands on both sides. I picked some of these up in the U.S. since the shape and basic ingredients are similar to a well loved Canadian Dad's cookie. They just don't even compare to Canada's Dad's Goodie Rings made by Kraft Foods. If you are a fan of this cookie and get the opportunity to pick up a pack of Dad's Goodie Rings in Canada, you will probably love them."
2,"I enjoy the Newman's Own Pretzels on a regular basis and decided to start buying them by the case as my local grocery store stopped carrying them.  The first two cases I bought from a different distributor were fine, however in the last case I purchased from Amazon, all the pretzels tasted stale, although the bags weren't out of expiration and didn't appear to be opened.  I was very disappointed with this batch."
2,"I was recently told I needed to reduce salt for health reasons and I was so haapy to get the Table Tasty and try it. There is a dash of mixture of vegetable taste , however no salt taste. I was very dissappointed."
2,"This hemp bag barely measures 6"" by 8"" and the drawstring is sewn into the fabric on the one end which makes it hard to close. Don't fall for the cheap carabiner trick like I did. Go with the Sprout Lady bags they are almost twice the size and the drawstring works well, then go get yourself a carabiner from the dollar store. Sprouts are awesome, Sprouts=Life :)"
2,"I bought this to try because of the RHONJ connection.  At first, it seemed as if the water wasn't black, but it was the label that was making the inside liquid color.<br /><br />It does seem like you are drinking murky water, even though the taste doesn't reflect that.  I am, however, cancelling my reoccurring shipments as I enjoy the Voss water a lot more."
2,"Shocked to see so many positive reviews for this product. As another reviewer said the ingredients are: horseradish, turmeric, spirulina. Calling this wasabi is like calling food coloring saffron. And you don't have to have lived in Japan to see that this stuff ain't wasabi. The instructions say ""mix powder to form a paste"". Well, it does have heat. But what you get is this ugly, pale and chalky paste. You need to use a LOT of powder and very little water to get it to the right consistency. Next time, I'll try getting my hands on REAL wasabi root from the asian grocery store."
2,"You get what you pay for.  This jerky was crumbly and overly seasoned with MSG.  Papaya extract is used to soften the meat, but is over used in this jerky.  The result is a crumby texture that does not hold together when chewed.  It was not disgusting, but I would not buy it again.  Try their one pound bags instead."
2,"If you want delicious Organic Vegan gummy bears go for the Surf Sweets ""Fruity Bears"" instead they are delicious. These are hard and fairly tasteless in comparison"
2,"Not good.  Old, nearly out of date when I got it from ABC Wholesale.  Even my son who eats everything would not eat this.  Avoid ABC Wholesale, too.  Details in ad said I was supposed to get 96 bars, but they only gave me 16 bars.  Complained, but they held fast.  Amazon was no help.  Avoid ABC Wholesale, too."
2,"If you plan on eating these directly, they are not good.  Buying these will make you want to make your own, knowing your own first try will taste better."
2,"This is was the only dry food that we have feed to our dogs for years but recently it seems as if they changed the recipe because both of my dogs are not able to digest the food as easily and now vomit periodically when this food is eaten.  I like the idea of feeding my dogs organic food and I am willing to pay more for it but certainly, if they are vomiting, there is something in it that is not healthy.  When I switched to another brand, sold by the vet, they no longer vomit but the vet does not sell organic.  I'm still not sure what the best alternative is."
2,"I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond ""Roasted Almonds - Honey"" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW"">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very ""off"" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."
2,"I recently bought the Nespresso Totem for my Nespresso capsules.  I did not buy it through Amazon, but was compelled to leave a review.  Out of the box the product looks decent enough, however, upon taking a closer look, I noticed that the clear piece (I believe it's acrylic)  gets scratched easily.  The piece is basically a clear tube that sits on the black plastic bottom.  It is not held into place and sits loosely on the base.  Additionally fingerprints, water spots, and dust are very visible on the ""tube."". Finally, when capsules are added into the holder, you have to be really careful because the weight of the ones higher up in the tube can easily push the the ones in the base right out of the holder and onto the table. Oh, and one other thing, the base doesn't turn.  The carousel for Nespresso is much cheaper, looks nicer, is more sturdy, and is on spinning base."
2,"After trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYLW7A"">Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, 10.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and liking it, I was looking forward to trying the flake version next. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. First of all, I could not believe how sweet this was! I could practically feel my teeth rotting away, and though it only has one more gram than the ""O"" cereal (11 grams to O's 10), it was far sweeter. Adding to the con list is that this particular cereal uses high fructose corn syrup in addition to sugar and honey and has next to no fiber at all (less than 1 gram according to the box). As for the pros, you can definitely taste the honey and hint of nut and it stays crunchy for a while. Yes, it has some vitamins and minerals, but on the whole, I will never get this again and can only eat it mixed with an unsweetened cereal. Since <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28"">Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut, 14.1-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> is basically a waste of calories, I cannot recommend this unless you want a ""dessert"" cereal."
2,"After loving the taste of the vanilla, I had high hopes for this, which were quickly dashed upon trying it.  It had an alkaline taste to it, bitter.  It also had a similar strong aftertaste.  Would not recommend to fans of chocolate."
2,"This was one of my most disappointing deals ever on Amazon. I won't go into my experience with the seller. I tried the yeast to make a Russian drink called Kvass. The yeast acted like it was dead. There was a sick, yeasty, moldy taste to the result. All the equipment was sanitized, but this didn't make any difference. Never Again."
2,"The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product."
2,"Try as I might I couldn't get past the taste of this product.  I tried one squeeze, one-half a squeeze, two squeezes, etc. No matter what I tried, I couldn't come up with a taste that was pleasing.  And the aftertaste was downright discouraging.  No thank you."
2,"I was surprised with the unanimous good rating of this product. Guests at our inn thought this is strictly a cereal for very young children. We were surprised that the cereal mix had a large percentage of corn flakes!!"
2,"I recently did research on kidney/renal failure as I just lost one of my male 7 year old cats due to CRF (chronic renal failure). CRF is common in cats, especially male cats due to their intricate urinary system. About a year ago we discovered Weruva & started adding various flavors along with their high quality dry food. My cats totally loved their new canned foods especially Out Back Grill, Asian Fushion and Mack & Jack which happen to be all seafood based. I did not know that a seafood diet is not good for cats. Fish can contribute to urinary tract problems in cats. My cat that had CRF was a slim, but normal weight for his small size, but had lost weight partly due to his high fish diet (I found out fish based cat foods do not contain the fat they need). Wuruva, Tiki Cat,Tiki Cat King Kamehameha Luau Variety Pack Canned Cat Food 12/2.8-oz cans etc are all low fat. Cats need animal fat like chicken fat, fish oil, even emu oil. Besides being needed for their overall health, it's important for their kidneys! Not that I know of any onion eating cats, but I also learned never to give any onion to your cat. Deli (sandwich meat)& some meats (ham, hot dogs) may contain onion powder. The vegetable broths in canned tuna may contain onion. Read the label on any broth (including chicken, beef) as most contain onion or ""spices"". Occasional tuna water from a can of tuna packed in water is okay from what I've read & that is something I have given my cats. Also, I am always careful to keep anything with Xylitol (natural sweetener) away from cats & dogs, that includes toothpaste & gum including the gum wrappers & any toothpaste spatter in the bathroom sink (if your cat likes to sleep in your sink). My CRF cat was the runt of the litter so was a 'small average' size, very active, happy, partially outdoor cat who also ate high quality dry food, but mostly Weruva the past year or so. Over the past year we probably tried every Weruva flavor & it was great seeing how well my cats took to quite a few flavors, especially the fish based ones. I made the error assuming they were getting the right food. I won't be buying fish based cat foods by the case anymore."
2,"Still sitting in my fridge after a year, Used about one sheet. Just go to your local market or store - don't be lazy like me! not fresh or very tasty at all either..."
2,"I ordered this with a lot of excitement as Fall gets closer. I was disappointed because it's more spice than pumpkin. I'll be giving it away to someone else."
2,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Barney Butter, have been buying it for months now. I have been buying it for $17-19 on Amazon, and now it jumped to $30! That is RIDICULOUS for a 3 pack.. Guess I will have to find another brand."
2,"I gave a can to my parents, because I couldn't find anything to do with it, and the last can is still laying around the cabinets in the kitchen.  Well, take away vitamin supplements, the beverage is not worth drinking at all.  I am Puerto Rican, while some people may think that Hispanics would all love this, I don't even like it.  Anyway how to describe it is absolutely impossible.  It not as bad as to make you gag, but I expected a similar taste of what you get when you mix milk with vanilla ice cream.  You wont get this with this product.  It's yellow like most people explain, and my 4 year old liked it for a couple of weeks before he completely lost interest on it.<br /><br />Do you want to know about a great vitamin supplemental powder you can put in milk that children love and wont get tired of?  The name is ""Rich Chocolate Ovaltine"" my 4 year old has been drinking it almost everyday since he was 1 year old.  Never seems to get tired of it.... and ME?  I love it!<br /><br />I thought this Vanilla Nesquik would be a great substitution when (and if) we ever ran out of Ovaltine.  And you know very well how horrible chocolate Nesquik is, I hate it.  My son doesn't seem to like it (he leaves his sippy cup full laying around).  With this one I guess it's official I just can't stand Nesquik products.  They should use me as a flavor tester for their products, their sales would increase I bet."
2,"This has got definite crunch if that's what you are looking for.  I would say that if you don't have good strong teeth don't attempt to eat this.  There are tiny little crunchy pieces that can break a filling.  The Tomato Chipotle flavor has a little chipotle warmth but no real heat, I wasn't crazy about the flavors or lack of it.  I did keep chewing away for the definite crunch factor.  If you are looking for a healthier snack I would recommend trying Newmans Own Organic Pretzels, Spelt."
2,"I've bought and enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past, and I like that their profits are donated to charity.  And I like cookies of all types and flavors.  So, I requested these cookies ... Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps ... to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  After receiving these, I gathered the family test team to try them.<br /><br />First the good.  The cookies are a little over an inch in diameter, and perhaps an eight of an inch thick, a good size for a snack cookie. They have a strong ginger and molasses flavor, which is critical for a good gingersnap cookie.  And the cookies are made from organic ingredients.  That about sums up the good.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  The cookies were very hard and almost unchewable.  They were a dark brown on top and almost black on the bottom, as in they might have been really overbaked.  The molasses and ginger had a harsh flavor, with an unpleasant aftertaste that takes awhile to fade.  Again, it was almost as if they'd been baked to the point of being burnt.  My wife, who loves the occasional ginger snap, immediately commented that these were the worst gingersnap cookies she'd ever had. My youngest son, who's never met a treat he didn't like, refused a second cookie.  None of my crack test team liked them or wanted more.  So I've eaten the rest of the bag myself, partly to see if they grew on me, and partly to make sure that it just wasn't a few bad cookies.  Unfortunately, they neither grew on me or nor got any better the deeper into the bag I ate.<br /><br />I'm thinking maybe I got a bad bag of cookies ... I have a tough time believing a firm with the deserved good reputation as Newman's Own would consider what I received to be something they'd put their good name to.  But I have to rate what I've been provided, and I'm giving them a generous two stars."
2,"Thought I was getting the packaged ramen, got the instant lunch instead.  Little if any flavor.  Mainly taste the bland noodles and rehydrated pieces of corn."
2,"I use to have a lot of lemon barley water as a kid during summers. My physician was of the opinion that barley had a lot of medicinal value in curbing minor infections and strengthening the immmunity of the body.<br />However i was extremely dissapointed with this product as it does not have enough of barley which it should. This can be used with spirits for cocktails if u decide to go ahead purchasing it, but not worth it as there are better and cheaper products out there for your taste buds!"
2,"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing.  I found the vanilla to be barely detectable."
2,"Well makes beautiful pancakes, but the nuts (and there are alot of them) tasted stale. very VERY stale.  will not buy again as I bellieve Kona Coast is not using the best products for this. Was much too obvious nuts were ransed even tho the date on pak was good for another year... arghh."
2,"I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers."
2,"I make my own baby food but when we travel I give my daughter plum organics and happy baby food. She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip."
2,"We ordered this for the variety, and made a separate order of just plain chocolate flavored straws.  The description of this product doesn't tell enough.  What you get is ten packages, each containing five straws at 0.21 ounces each.  So the value is good, but there is no variety, they are all chocolate.  So we are all stocked up on chocolate now!  The product is great, but the two stars are for the misleading description."
2,"Well, I tried this because I wanted my cat to eat more healthy.  He is used to Fancy Feast and Friskies.  He is a male, 13 yrs old.  When he smelled it he started to seem reluctant, like ""what the heck is this?""  Then he decided to try it.  He ate a little and walked away.  Just enough to vomit it back up on my carpet.  It came up just like it went down, in little balls.  I don't know what the problem is, but he definitely won't eat it.  I will try to mix it with some wet food, hopefully he will eat it."
2,"Our Great Dane puppy loved the first 30lb. bag, no problems whatsoever. The second bag, however, caused extreme projectile diarrhea(no joke), which isn't cool for anyone or thing, especially an inside dog. My wife was pretty ticked(she cleans that stuff up). Our 13 week puppy lost ten pounds and spent time in the vet hospital, just to get her digestive system back on. We will not be buying this anymore. We know for certain that it was the food. After switching to another brand, she would get better, then we'd try again. It would come back immediately. We switched to eagle pack, (red bag). It's the best!"
2,"This is my favorite tea. I buy LOTS of it. But this was like someone hired their kid sister to cram a box full of old tea bags and ship it to me. Not impressed, Stash."
2,"This is pretty good. I like the taste a lot... However, it does not behave in your mouth like normal hard candy... instead, it develops into sharp edges as you suck on it, enough to cut your tongue. Also, I'm gassier when I eat these than with other similar products. Dr John's xylotol-sweetened hard candy does not have these problems. I hope Xyla sorts out these issues."
2,"The product I purchased was a gift for a friend. It arrived in a timely fashion. Unfortunately,the safety cap was not secured once my friend<br />received and product. I subsequently notified the supplier and informed them of the problem. They indicated that we should discard the product and they would re-issue a replacement. The replacement product took about eight days to arrive and again the safety cap was not secured. This was not a good gift giving experience.  I chose not to attempt it again.<br /><br />Regrets,<br />H.F. Slayton"
2,"Granted, this is a very subjective review. Everyone's taste buds are different. My baby hated the taste of this stuff. Like visibly making ""this is disgusting"" faces at me and wondering why I fed him this.  There's another one called beef and spinach or something that seems much more palatable to my baby."
2,"While I thought the concept of Tuna Jerky sounded like a good idea, in reality these fell short.  The tuna was extremely hard and dry; all moisture was lost in the curing process and left the tuna tasting more like hard paper.  I enjoy the Salmon Jerky, but I will not be ordering the tuna again.  From the brittle hard texture to the strange after taste, this tuna was disappointing."
2,"Unlike the other ""Think!"" products, this one is smaller, has a bland taste, and has a partial sugar coating. This is the first product I've bought from them that I regret purchasing. It's particularly disappointing since the company is supposedly using this product to raise money for cancer research. If you're going to sell one of your products to benefit people with cancer, it's adding insult to injury to choose one of your worst products."
2,"I have tried several flavors of Sweetleaf products, and have had no problems. The ones I recently received seem to be watered down. I used to be able to sweeten a one liter bottle of seltzer with two full squirts of the stuff. Now with two squirts, i barely taste it. My friend noticed the same issue with the Berry flavor i purchased for her!"
2,"I've tried this low-sodium variety and it had a surprisingly ""peppery"" taste that I did not care for. Also, you can reduce the sodium content of other flavors by only using half or two-thirds of the seasoning packet. You will get more flavor, but end up consuming as much sodium - sometimes even less, depending on the variety - than you would if you ate this low-sodium kind  with its entire seasoning packet.<br /><br />Ramen has an unfair bad reputation. Use less of the seasoning, add some leftover frozen vegetables, maybe toss in pieces of leftover chicken or cooked bacon, and you've gotten a decent small meal. I'm not saying that you should live off of Ramen only, but Ramen recipes have gotten my husband and I through some financially-tough months in the past."
2,"The ginger taste in these cookies is just about right but I would have preferred a cookie a bit less hard/crispy. These are a bit too difficult to eat in that respect for my liking although I guess that's why the call 'em 'snaps'."
2,"Anyone who is a fan of the Mahi-Mahi fish knows that it has a very distinct flavor. It's non-fishy. A true Mahi filet is delicious. I've eaten Mahi at many restaurants, and in the Caribbean. I can tell you that what I just took out of the box and baked, is NOT Mahi. Some parts of it were EXTREMELY fishy, and it just didn't have that Mahi taste. Texture seemed to be that of a Mahi fish, but taste wise, absolutely not. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,"Back in Germany I would buy organic sunflower oil from Rapunzel or another brand, but now in the USA, I am having a big problem to find an appropriate oil for the autumn months.<br /><br />In a local health food store 3 years ago I actually found Rapunzel Sunflower Oil, and I bought every single bottle they had. But last year I ran out, and the problem began anew. What to cook with potatoe dishes now?<br /><br />Then I saw this offer, and since I know their nut oils are really of good quality (yes really, no sarcasm here), I trusted them and ordered this set of 4 cans. Another reviewer mentioned the cute tins, but hey, what good are cute tins if the product does not keep what the ad promised???<br /><br />OK, maybe it was my own fault to assume the term ""organic"" must automatically mean ""unrefined"". Stupid me, I really did assume that! But this oil is refined!<br /><br />It has no taste nor aroma at all! It is just like all other refined industrial oils (""cooking oil"") from any american supermarket, only more expensive. I felt betrayed here.<br /><br />I didn't return it, as there was nothing technically wrong with it. I mean, there was nothing spoilt or broken, so I just used the tins up during the autumn and winter.<br /><br />But I will absolutely not order this again, as ""organic"" is not good enough! It must be ""unrefined"", and that it is not."
2,"They're OK.  They're very salty.  By far not as good as other flavors.  I recommend, like the other negative poster, Wasabi very strongly.  If you don't mind the salt content, Jalepeno Smokehouse is also a good bet.  This is not an improvement on Maui Garlic and Onion at all."
2,"I really must disagree with the other two reviewers.  I have found the aroma of this blend to be bitter, acidic and burnt.  That carries over and makes for a pretty lousy cup of coffee.  However, it isn't undrinkable and I suppose I'd put it on a par with what one would get from a cheap supermarket choice.<br /><br />Now, to be fair to Cafe Altura I want to note that there was air in my bag.  I don't know if this is unusual or if they do not vacuum pack their beans (which would lead to oxidation fairly quickly and hence the bitter aroma)."
2,"I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles."
2,"I bought this set for the neon pink color only to tint icing and after using 2 bottles of it, it was not very strong and not neon or bright pink at all. Kind of mauve. Would not buy again. I'm sticking w/ gel paste from now on."
2,"We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box.  No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging."
2,"After all of the hype and anticipation these were a real let down. Average taste and expensive...I will go back to Costco for my imported canned tomatoes at 1/4 the cost!"
2,"I HAVE GROWN LOST OF WHEAT GRASS BEFORE AND ALL WAYS HAD GOOD RESULTS WITH THIS ONE I HAVE STRUGGLED A LOT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL."
2,"I have 3 cats with 3 different personalities. None of them were impressed with these treats at all. I gave each one of them a fourth of a treat as I have small cats and the treats are rather large. All three were interested as I was getting the packaging open. Two of the cats tried to eat the treat, but they were not able to chew it. One gave up after just a little bit and the other gave it a pretty good effort and even came back to try again a minute later. Then I decided to take another treat and crumble it up really good. I laid it out for them. One cat actually ate a few pieces, but that was it. The second cat didn't even come over to try and the third actually tried to bury it."
2,"These are okay for a mass produced product frim a factory.  Nothing spectacular.<br /><br />Ordered direct from the company's web site. Faced w/ 3 confusing choices: ship & deliver ASAP, ship whenever, deliver in time for Christmas. I chose the first thinking it was the fastest. My items were not delivered until 12/27. When I contacted Swiss Colony, they said, ""Too bad.""<br /><br />Next time I'll get real petit fours shipped from an actual bakery."
2,"Stash Premium Coconut Mango Wuyi Oolong Tea is right up there with the flavored teas that don't have flavor.  I'm extremely disappointed as I purchased 100-count box. Even doubling and tripling up on tea bags, there's little to no flavor.  I've spent over $53.00 on 4 different flavors of STASH and it's like throwing my money away."
2,"The candy I ordered from Amazon was for distribution to the neighborhood children this past Halloween.  The first disappointment was that it wasn't even shipped until the week after Halloween.  It was ordered with sufficient time to arrive before the holiday.<br /><br />The more important concern became evident when it arrived.  This candy is 2nd's from the manufacturing line.  It is candy that was not wrapped properly.  This varies from the wrapper not quite being sealed to only ½ a wrapper to begin with or completely out of the wrapper because at least one end was open.<br /><br />At least 25% of all the candy received was out of the wrappers.  Another 50% was not sealed on at least one end.  This would have made it inappropriate to distribute.  I would have had to sort each bag for the few pieces I could have given to the children.<br /><br />The good news is that if you're purchasing for your own families consumption the candy is fresh.  There are no quality problems with the chocolate."
2,"I'm gonna confess. I'm trying to find a different alternative to feeding my dog Blue Buffalo dog food. I should really give up the hunt because really Blue is one of the best quality foods around.<br /><br />I thought this maybe a healthy choice for my dog but I was wrong.  When I looked at the back of the package it had the following ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, water, meat and bone meal, propylene glycol, sugar, tricalcium phosphate.....  Just to name a few. I dunno, but that doesnt exactly strike  confidence in me as a buyer.  And as others have said some of their dogs are getting sick, there have been recalls etc with this product.<br /><br />Now, dont get me wrong, my dog loves it. But then again if I feed kids french fries every day they'd love it too.  So that isn't a good measure.<br /><br />I think what put me over the edge is when I opened the container(where I put my dog food) and it smelled processed  and made me gag. The food smelled fake. The same effect does not happen when I buy Blue.<br /><br />It's true you get what you pay for. I'll be sticking to a higher quality prodcut."
2,"WEll.. going off of the other reviews where their kids loved them etc...I do not like them and neither do my kids or grandkids so far. Sorry. I'm sure they are healthy, however.. I was disappointed thining they were freeze dried Edemenis or something like that.. not a formed cracker to taste and look like a snow pea ?! sorry, but these 11 bags are going back.. I'd be sending the full 12, however... one bag was opened and then the hubby tossed it after awhile..."
2,"Stick with the Sprout or Happy Baby meals. This flavor is just not appetizing. The Harvest Turkey is only slightly better. They taste a lot like mashed potatoes mixed with a bit of this and that-- not yum mashed potatoes, kind of odd. Not inedible, but not something we would ever buy again."
2,"I started buying this product in January and it was thick, creamy and delicious.  I needed a hand blender to mix the thick cream with the milk and enjoyed using it to make puddings, etc.  Then, in the Spring the product changed dramatically for the worse.  As previous reviewers stated, they started sourcing the milk from Sri Lanka instead of Thailand and the end product was thin, watery and had little clumps of fat that would not and could not be blended into the milk.  I called the customer service and they advised me to wait before buying more until the can once again said that it was a product of Thailand.  So, a few weeks ago, I was delighted to see that the cans at my local health food store once again stated that they were a ""product of Thailand"".  However, the product is still not the same product as it was before the change in sourcing.  While it is back to having a creamy like consistency, it is noticeably thinner.  Instead of needing a spoon, it pours right out of the can with the same consistency and thickness of light cream.  I can no longer use it to make puddings, etc because it is too thin.  It's as if someone watered down the product.  I called the company once again and they had absolutely no explanation for this change in thickness.  For a comparison, I also bought a can of the Thai Kitchen brand coconut milk (also sourced from Thailand) and it was exceptionally thick and creamy, about twice the thickness as the Native Forest.  So, until someone can give me a good explanation as to why the new coconut milk is so thin, I will switch to the Thai Kitchen brand.  What a shame, since this used to be a great product."
2,"I was impressed how moist considering it is made of 100% whole wheat this fig bar was the first time I taste it. Everyday,I buy one at my work's vending machine. To have my own stash, so I ordered 2 boxes. Excited, when it arrived, but very disappointed that it was not as moist as the ones I buy at the machine! I thought, it will just be a couple of bad ones, but No...ALL the bars was so dry, gritty and hardly no Fig fruit on it....I ended up throwing it each time I open one. I placed a complaint about it but nothing had been done. I will never buy their bars again even at my workplace's vending machine!"
2,"It's hard to come up with something positive about this product. The pasta is tiny nodules shaped like grains of rice; the broccoli is about two tablespoons of grainy black powder that looked like insect parts; the cheese sauce, while fairly tasty, was only remotely cheese-flavored. About the only part of the dish I liked was the chicken, and that was my contribution.<br /><br />This might be a good product to stock in your emergency kit, since you can be sure it'll still be there when the big one hits. If you want cheese, chicken, pasta, and broccoli, buy your own cheese, chicken, and broccoli, and add them to a box of Pasta Roni or some such."
2,"Like too many GF products these are drowning in salt to drown out the bland rice flour flavor. I discovered Glutino crackers over the holidays and recommend them as the best gluten free cracker I've tried. My favorite is the Glutino Cheese Cracker with just a hint of cheese flavor that compliments rather than overwhelms the flavor of the spreads, cheese etc. spread on top. A great find for holiday!"
2,"The price was great (>$5/lb)...but, next time, I'll prefer to pay more to avoid this coffee (to my takste=, this is more along the lines of dishwater).<br /><br />Given a choice, I'd take Pete's Major Dickinson's very dark, delicious blend.,  Unfortunatelym it's almost 3X the price of this coffee).<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll find something in between the two. ...I'll report back when I find it!"
2,"I had to choke these down, they were hard, crumbly and bitter.  The aftertase took a good 15 mninutes to go away, even after trying various substances to get rid of it.  Smells like chocolate, tastes like chemicals.  They do have a kick though, so don't eat the whole box in one sitting.. though I doubt anyone could stomach it."
2,"This product has an oily consistency.  Perhaps they were going for creamy, but it winds up tasting like it came out of a Star Trek food synthesizer, and I mean the old 1970's series, not any Next Generation tech.  And I'm still not quite sure if heating up those artificial sweeteners is a good idea."
2,"I did a long search for bio degradable bags and settled on these.  They are fine until the seam at the bottom slips apart.  Granted this only happened probably 3 times in the box, but that's three times too many.  Wet poop falling straight out on to the side walk is an unpleasant, difficult job to clean up.  Not being able to trust the bag makes for a tedious hold after use for the remainder of the walk.  Disappointed.  Find a better adhesive for the seam and it would be all good!"
2,"didn't get chocolate cherries. i got rasins. didnt get pistachios. i got almonds. that sucked ! RIP OFF ! I was disappointed."
2,"If you want applesauce with a bit of carrot flavoring, this is the one for you. If you're expecting carrot puree, skip it.<br /><br />On the other hand, the price is pretty good for an organic product."
2,"I have bought k-cups from amazon before and this was the first time that I bought the Van Houtte and am disappointed , not so much in the taste but that many of the cups in this order where defective and would drain all of the coffee grounds into my cup or just soak up the water and not drain at all. I would suggest that people do not buy these."
2,"Is this the next Netflix and Bank of America? The price for these has risen 50% in the last 3 months. You can count me out, its almost cheaper to stop at the local choke and puke to get coffee. You should really reconsider the price point for these before you price yourself out of business..."
2,"Around the mid 70s Ralston Purina sold the chex cereal collection to General Mills, due to creative accounting and other cost saving measures they changed the formula to the carboard breakfast food it is today. The Old wheat chex R.P. cereal was hearty, nutty and healthy. My grandmother use to fry them up with other things like nuts to serve at bridge games. I remember the old ad campian "" so good it was banned in Boston"""
2,"I purchased this coffee along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZI9VSQ"">La Crema's Hazelnut flavored coffee</a> and they were both very weak. While I found the flavor of St Nick's Nog to be somewhat better than that of the hazelnut, both required two tablespoons per cup in my drip maker to brew a drinkable cup. This effectively doubles the cost of the coffee, making it one of the most expensive coffees I've ever purchased.<br /><br />Update: I threw out the remainder of this coffee shortly after writing this review. The coffee wasn't enjoyable and began to feel like a chore to drink. I originally gave this coffee one star more than I gave the hazelnut for what I perceived as a somewhat better flavor. I'll leave that extra star, but only for this coffee's more pronounced flavor, which helps cover the same bitterness found in the hazelnut, and also because the hazelnut was that bad. Something else to note about this coffee is that it made me strangely thirsty. Even between sips, I found myself thinking about a glass of water."
2,"I was really hoping that this had that ""fresh"" ginger bite. It tastes like lemon/lime soda with ginger powder added. Maybe I'm more accustomed to the strong taste of fresh ginger in food and drinks. I tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SUBKK"">Q-Ginger, 8-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> and loved it. However it was a bit pricey. Guess I'll keep looking."
2,"I had to drive a bit of a distance to a Chinese market but it was worth it.  The same same amount sold here for nearly $50 is available for about $9 at 99 Ranch Market (Los Angeles).  Yes, it's not ""heirloom"" but what's really the difference?  It certainly ain't organic...  It all cooks up just the same."
2,"I love Ezekiel bread so I thought I would give the pasta a try. I am giving two stars because the ingredients are great. Unfortunately, the texture is like wet cardboard. I will be going back to regular whole wheat pasta when I finish choking down the other 5 boxes of this pasta-shaped abomination."
2,"I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite."
2,"OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!"
2,"My daughter loves many of the Sprout meals but this one she absolutely loathed. Simply no taste! I'm not surprised she fussed each time I tried to give her a bite. Thumbs down to this one."
2,"The taste is not great, but it's bearable. I could not get used to the smell, the unfinished box is still sitting in my drawer and I've no plans to stock up in future."
2,"very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting"
2,"I ordered directly from Amazon.  The coffee received only has 3 months of shelf life left.  Unless you can use up all 3 bags in 3 months, you will end up throwing away some of the coffee, and that's a waste of money.  Coffee bought from the local stores usually has much longer shelf life left.  Be informed before you order."
2,"This bottle came and smelled so vile that I had to leave it on the porch! After a few days I could bring it inside.<br /><br />Not sure what caused that, as there was nothing unusual about the packaging. The conditioner's smell also is unappealing (though not as bad). As a conditioner, it worked fairly well,smoothly out tangles and leaving hair shiny. But it's hard to imagine anything gentle and ""nourishing"" would smell like this."
2,"I bought this because of all the great reviews, but unfortunately neither one of my two dogs were at all interested."
2,"They sell this rice too expensive on Amazon!! You can get it for a lot of cheaper from Chinese Supermarket."
2,"The candy was the genuine article and of good quality.  It was delivered on-time as promised.  So, no complaints on what was delivered and when.  But I think they were way over-priced (over $1 each).  I won't order these again."
2,"I thought I would give this a try.  Compared to other light roasts I've purchased (Gevalia) it's dark and it has a bitter taste. Not smooth.  It's more like a burned ash taste.  Some may like this taste. I don't.  I can't stand Starbucks for example, but if you do, you may enjoy these beans.  I'll try a courser grind next and update if the grind makes any difference."
2,"This cologne has too much scent It made me nauseous - the only good thing is it lasts for ages on your dog."
2,"Disappointment with this shipment. Firstly they came loose in the package, then there were only 22 flakes ( I counted several times) and they tasted somewhat stale. ( We are cadbury flake regulars!), even though the sell by date was not reached. They must be for the Arab world as they had the Arabic writing on  the items. I had used this same seller I thought in the past and got a proper yellow box with the correct number inside. Anyway not the end of the world. I will try to be sure of the supplier next time I order flakes.  I should have sent them back but could not be bothered."
2,"Get the Trader Joes make instead. This one is too spicy within the cake itself, and the coating isn't good at all."
2,"I ordered two of the 7 oz packages of this product to give as gifts to some of my friends who cook. When I received the product they only sent 1 14oz package. The package was also partially ripped open and spilling the salt content. I will not be ordering from this company again."
2,"Honey Nut is my favorite flavor of Cheerios, and while I will do generic of a lot of things, I have got to have brand name Cheerios.  They're just so much better than the off-brands.  However, the price on this item is often outrageously high.  I've seen it over $25, today's price is about $18... I've been watching this for about 10 days, and I have never seen it the same price two days in a row.  I managed to score mine at about $7 last week, but I'm thinking I just got lucky.  Definitely not a better value than just getting them at Sam's or using a coupon and buying them at the grocery store.  Lame."
2,"The tea tastes fine.<br />I just don't know for how long...<br />The tea bags came (loose) in a cardboard box.<br />(Must be institutional packaging.)<br />We'll see how it lasts."
2,"A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more."
2,"I went into this product with high hopes, but came out feeling like I was duped.  First off, if you put this just in water, it tastes absolutely terrible.  Might as well throw some stevia in there.  Also, this stuff will cake on the sides of any glass or water bottle you put it into.  Doesn't mix well at all.<br /><br />Lastly, all this ""ORAC"" hype, yet I noticed absolutely zero benefits of taking it.  I noticed about the same effects I would get if I ate a strawberry.  ONE strawberry.<br /><br />Overhyped, overpriced product.  Spend your money elsewhere.<br /><br />Update: 2/24/12: Sambazon must've changed the formulation.  The powder dissolves A LOT better than it used to. I got my hands on this product again after my original review, and I find that it mixes pretty well now.  It's still a little gritty, but not terribly bad.  Almost unnoticeable in a protein shake.  Problem is, this formula is only a 3g serving size.  That's 1 scoop.  When you use the frozen Acai packs, it's 25g.  Yes, a lot of that 25g is water, so you have to subtract some, but let's say it's 50% water, for arguments sake.  That will means 1 frozen pack is equivalent to 4 scoops of this Acai powder.  Since I realized that, I've been using 2-4 scoops of this stuff in a smoothie. NOW I feel the benefits.  1 scoop is nothing, and shouldn't be the serving size.  I recommend people start with 2 and work up to 4 scoops in their smoothies.  Then you'll notice the Acai benefits, if you didn't feel them before."
2,"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people."
2,"Unfortunately these bars taste rather stale and old...nuts do not keep forever...and I get the sense that these have been held somewhere for far too long.  Better to buy from your local store where you have some idea of the turnover..and can easily complain should the same problem arise."
2,"Okay, this is something you would really have to want in order to use it. However, for myself, I don't think this is a product that I would go out of my way to obtain. The flavor is... well... not what I was expecting! It has an aftertaste that I don't think I could get use to.<br /><br />I gave it a couple of tries, in four 16 oz. bottled waters, and it was hard to want to drink it down. But by golly, I got them down.<br /><br />There is alot more to go, but I think I'm going to pass on the rest of it. It does require refrigeration after opening. So there the rest of it will sit.<br /><br />It is clearly marked on the rim ""Not For Children"". I can truly appreciate that, and I'm glad to see them owning that. I see way to many children under 8 years old chugging down these types of beverages.<br /><br />As far as sports beverages and vitamin replenishment, I think I will just stick to my good ol' trusty water and fruits & veggies."
2,"I have a dachshund that will (frankly) eat out of the cat box if she could but she won't chew this!  She tried it once - chewed for a while and has not touched it since.  Lucy currently has no other chews so its not like she has a choice to pick from, she simply chooses to not 'chew' rather than use this product.  It has been a couple weeks now - no change.  It is expensive but she goes through other chews too fast, I thought it would be worth it.  Back to grass-fed bully sticks for us. Honestly, it must taste pretty bad if she won't eat/chew it."
2,"It's not that glittery, and it becomes gummy upon contact with moisture... I think this stuff only works if you sprinkle it on and then immediately serve the dish. I used it as a decoration on top of a cheesecake, and within 30 minutes it had ""melted"" into a gooey substance - and the cheesecake had just come out of the refrigerator. Cute idea, poor execution."
2,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQYS7Q"">Terra Kettles Cut Blend Potato Chips, Sea Salt, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a> While these chips are crisp, they feel and taste too oily for me.  The per serving fat listed online is 6g while the bag lists it at 10g.  Since the bag contains 2 servings, that would be 20g per 2 oz bag.  They are packaged in stronger material than other chips I have tried."
2,"Although the taste is not too bad, it is bland and tastes like really weak drink mix. There is only 10% fruit juice so it is no wonder the taste is not too realistic. To be honest, there is little that resembles either orange or pineapple. It has an ""artificial"" taste."
2,"I was disappointed in the cheese.  It did not have any packing to keep it cold. The taste was a litte off - not like the St. Andre cheese I have eaten in the past."
2,"This cereal is terrible. It is stale, heavy, and tastes like cardboard. The flakes are thick and tasteless.It is also very overpriced for the quality."
2,"van houtte chocolate raspberry truffle lack the rasberry taste, which was what I was shopping for."
2,"Watch out what you get for the price ($9.99 + $6.50 shipping), which is almost $60 a pound with this weight of 125 grams."
2,"Ghiradelli 72% Intense Dark Chocolate was not an eating chocolate for me. I received this as a gift at Christmas, and instead of eating it, I used it to make hot chocolate. I simply melted the chocolate in a double boiler, then added milk, sugar, and a little vanilla. It made for a great hot beverage. But for me, the chocolate by itself could not stand alone.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00285DLZQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,"This was a gift from a friend that used and liked it.  I, however, found the spoon part of this too large (too deep) for my daughter.  Now that she's older, it might work, but we feed her thicker foods, and I don't know that they'd squeeze through the dispenser well.  I also found it awkward to hold."
2,"These protein sticks have a very strong ""gamy"" flavor. It's hard to describe -- it's not sickening, but it is weird. Also, they are extremely dry. Having purchased them, I'll finish them, but I doubt I will buy them again.<br /><br />*Update* On second thought, I may have to throw these out. I've eaten them twice, and both times they caused me some moderate gastrointestinal distress."
2,"Immediately after drinking Penta, I definitely felt ""refreshed"" (whatever that means), the texture seems ""smoother"" and the water appears clearer, but I believe that these characteristics are merely psychosomatic and fall in line with thinking of what pure water means. I felt calmer overall, but I attribute this to the water, not the oxygen. Otherwise, I think the oxygen takes away from the full benefit of the product.<br /><br />After a few cycles of testing Penta, my instincts kicked in and I started reading about the effects of too much oxygen in the body and brain. Since it stands to reason that if Penta is infusing their bottles with oxygen, their water would end up being impregnated with it. Though the oxygen in their bottles could be minimal, it could be enough to offset the nitrogen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood after drinking enough of it, especially with their patented level of filtration. There's no doubt that Penta water feels like it is being absorbed more readily than others, an effect which seems enhanced when drinking it cold. I have noticed this effect also when I had a bout of altitude sickness in Colorado. At the time, someone recommended I drink plenty of water to feel better as it had oxygen in it. I found some bottled water (from another commercial brand) and drank as much as I could. I could literally feel the water oxygenate my body as I drank it.<br /><br />Logically, then, one might assume that water impregnated with oxygen would be better for you. I believe, though, that the benefits of oxygen in water are only met if the oxygen is within natural levels. Penta claims they add oxygen only to tighten the bottle. I'm sure their marketing team knew that people would come to their own conclusions about this statement and may assume that this was yet be another ""purifying"" aspect of Penta water. I know of no other drink manufacturer adding oxygen just to tighten their bottle, so I doubt there is a real concern about its use for packing purposes. For some of you who drink several bottles of Penta a day, you may want to consider how much you are over-saturating your blood with oxygen.<br /><br />I started doing some research on Penta with a much more critical eye. That is when I found James Randi. Mr. Randi, as some of you know, is a hyperbolic debunker and skeptic who has offered a one-million-dollar prize to anyone ""who can show under proper observing conditions, evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event."" After reading the letters (*which can be read publicly online) exchanged between Mr. Randi and the owner of Penta, I got the impression that the owner was just another health trend exploiter, not some arbiter of a new scientific frontier. The guy can't even spell. My thoughts are that this person stumbled upon the next trend of water purification and made a business decision to add a little something extra to merit a higher price point that would reap a greater profit than a competitor's brand. Don't get me wrong. I believe that deionized, low pH, metals -and -trace pharma free water is legit, but claims that Penta water is somehow more special than others using the same methods are truly unmitigated.<br /><br />I think people who are health-conscious these days are toeing the line between reasonable skepticism and hopeful hypochondriacs. I wanted to believe, like many people these days, that I could use an inexpensive regimen of pure supplements to undo any damage I've done to my body. I imagine that people think that when something like water, a necessary ingredient for sustaining human life, is hard to come by in an unadulterated state, it somehow means that ingesting great amounts of pure water must act as some sort of great equalizer in the body, that if you drink clean water, you are aiding your body in being able to reverse and repair damage.<br /><br />I'm sure some of you think my impressions of Penta are crackpot science at best, but consider how it is no different than staring at a few pdfs on the manufacturer's site, understanding none of it, and yet still believing a doctor claiming better benefits who was likely funded by Penta themselves to do the research. This method of boosting the appearance of legitimacy for purified water is common. Look up ""Ilumati Lithia water."" It appears they had involvement with a clinical trial from the University of British Columbia, a study that has been suspended due to ""logistical issues."" It's not that as a given I don't believe in the truthfulness of clinical trials. I just won't fall prey to believing that a product is better simply because it was involved in a clinical trial, especially if the product developer has anything to do with it. Think of how you yourself may be buying into quackery just by taking what a business driven for profit says at face value.<br /><br />I urge you to take stock of your own body and share what you've realistically experienced with Penta. I still believe pure water is extremely helpful for the body's regulation. Though this is not a cure-all, based on the competition out there, I believe this could be the best water on the market - if oxygen wasn't placed in the bottle as ""added value."""
2,"While I agree this is shipped in a nice wooden box that can be used for other things and the fish has an excellent flavor, I was surprised to find it was not what I expected.  I expected smoked lox salmon like you find at a good deli or grocery store, not fully cooked salmon as this actually is.  For those expecting the latter, this is a great product, however this is not for me as it was smoked (or cooked) too long."
2,"This toy is phenomenal.  It keeps both of our dogs (1 silky terrier, 1 boston terrier) busy, and actually keeps my boston's farting problem at bay (I'm serious).  The only downside is the plastic top that you have to screw off/on to put food into it is NOT durable.  I called customer service and they sent me a new one, but they sounded surprised because the tug-a-jug is apparently made of ballistic plastic (I don't even know what that means).  The 5 jugs I've gone through say otherwise...<br /><br />Note: I will continue to buy these anyways."
2,"Taste: OK,  Calorie content: good,  Protein content: excellent,  Price: outrageous. I don't see how they can justify the cost of these bars. I was expecting something truly extraordinary, but they are actually very ordinary. I won't buy these again."
2,"This tea used to be a little more expensive than WalMart or Sam's Club.  Now it is outrageous.  Will not order again.  $8.43 increase per case in two months."
2,"My dog loves it, it may be the soft texture but after giving it to her this week, she has had stomach issues so I checked the label, too much junk, no substance; I should have done that first, I switched her to Orijen which is a dry, good content, and she loves it; voted best dog food in 2010 and 2011."
2,"My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one."
2,"Don''t buy it. My dog loves the treat. HOWEVER, after I found out it was made in china, I decide to throw away the remaining portion. I don't want to take any chances. I see that someone left a review saying their dog got sick after eating the treat. Luckily my dog is doing fine still. But I won't buy this again."
2,"I have bought smaller cans of this delicious mix and was glad to see that a larger version was available. However, I was disappointed that cashews were few and far between. Not sure if it is a general product issue or batch issue. In any case, not buying it again."
2,"Ive been searching for a chocolate coffee creamer for a while - when I saw this product on Amazon,<br />I couldn't wait to get it!  But sadly, I should have known better - to me, ALL the International Delight creamers taste the same, as if they all start with the same basic creamer recipe (which has a readily identifiable flavor) and just add in the extra flavoring for whatever batch they're making.  I also found this creamer to be sorely lacking in chocolate flavor.  When you pour it out, it has such a thick, dark look that it comes as a surprise that the creamer has such an underwhelming chocolate flavor.<br />I took the rest of the 288 creamers to work for everyone to use, and the box is still there after 3 weeks barely half empty.  Apparently even when free this stuff doesn't delight.  If you really want great chocolate flavor in your coffee, add some extra dark chocolate syrup - don't bother with this stuff."
2,"These Lipton iced-tea packets are a great concept. Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, ""Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL."" This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate."
2,"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."
2,"I like the Starbucks Via instant coffee, but would rather support another company instead of Starbucks every day, and I wanted to have organic coffee. I got this based on the great reviews, but I didn't like the taste of the coffee, nor was I impressed at how well it dissolved in water. I begrudgingly drank it every day until it was gone."
2,"I bought this shortly after I quit drinking regular coke, I obviously knew it wouldn't be the same but expected it to give a bit of satisfaction when I craved soda, Boy was I wrong, this stuff is SWEET I know it's all natural fruit juice and that has sugar but even 28grams seems pretty high for 8 ounces. These taste like drinking a pixie stick, nothing like soda, I ended up giving some to a friend who loves that apple soda thats really sweet and even she said these were much sweeter and not very good. My fault for trusting the reviews and buying a case now I'm slowly forcing myself to drink them so they will be gone !!"
2,"I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they ""weren't bad"".  Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake ""cheez"" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items."
2,"This is just ok.  The good news is that it's cheap.  But a few days ago I drank a really high quality (and really expensive) organic coffee and there was absolutely no comparison.  If you put lots of sugar or flavored creamer in your coffee, this might be fine.  But if you drink your coffee with little cream or sugar, get a higher quality coffee.  If you French Press your coffee and love the ritual of making coffee, spend the money for better and fresher beans."
2,"This was the most flavorful jerky I have eaten, but all 12 of the containers were less then 1/2 full. It took 2 to make almost 1. I would like to try it again, but I would be wondering if I would get the same amount. It said on the package .44 oz it was not close."
2,"I am surprised at all the positive reviews on here for such a sugary cereal. I remembered this cereal from my childhood and sought it out for a healthier alternative. My first bite, I couldn't believe how sweet it was. I looked at the box and was astounded. 20 grams of sugar per serving! That's more than kiddie sugary cereals! I now mix it with a cup of yogurt to cut the sweet taste..."
2,"Moving from a coffee press to these coffee pods was a culture shock.  I don't know if it's the medium roast, or possibly needing more than one pod per cup of coffee, to me it tasted like the coffee in a cheap diner. I would highly recommend buying a single bag before you invest in a case to make sure it suits your palate."
2,"I was interested in this food and so was my cat until she got ill from two magical ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />They do absolutely nothing for your cat but can cause health issues. She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food."
2,"You gave me a package that was already opened with one bar missing.  NOT cool.  If this happens again, I am not ordering from you anymore."
2,"Unless you have an outside dog, don't get these. The smell is absolutely horrible and stinks up the entire house... ugh ..."
2,"I was a bit disappointed with these figs.  The price was good no doubt but the product was not the highest quality.  The figs are dried out and not the freshest.  I've purchased these shirazi figs before from a Middle Eastern store and fell in love with these little gems.  Those were so delicious but way too expensive for an on-going habit.  I think it's worth it though for a little treat once in awhile.  If I have a craving for these figs I'll purchase them from the store next time and pay a little extra."
2,"I've tasted Kung Pao sauce before at various Chinese food restaurants and Kung Pao<br />sauce has a spicy hot taste with a tangy flavor to it.<br />I tried to duplicate the flavor, but it is somewhat time-consuming.<br /><br />So, for those times, when I didn't feel like making my own sauce, I decided<br />to buy it from the bottle.<br /><br />Upon opening up the bottle of sauce, I noticed it was a bit thick and somewhat<br />difficult to smooth it evenly into the vegetables. Then, upon trying the<br />sauce......<br /><br />Ouch! It was pure heat radiating from my mouth and I quickly grabbed a glass<br />of water. If I wanted just hot pepper sauce, I would have bought it.<br />This sauce tasted only of hot peppers.<br /><br />To use this sauce, I had to add honey and vinegar to make it right.<br />If I am going to do that, I just as well make my own.<br /><br />If you like just HOT HOT HOT peppers, this is the sauce for you."
2,"Ive had Claxton<br /> fruitcakes in the past.  This fruitcake was the bottom of the barrel.  How old is it?  I bought three one pound cakes.  I looked forward to enjoying these as in the past.  The one I opened, was dry....I moistened it with Rum.  Still dry,  I drenched it with rum and, while the cake got gummy, the fruit stayed hard and dry.  There was an abundance of raisins and currents (all hard).  Fruits and citron were hard.  Nuts hard and dry ( small pieces at that).....  Cherries were few...very few.  Slices just crumbled into little wads because the fruit and nuts were so hard the knife wouldn't slice them neatly.  I'd send everything back, but the postage isn't worth the bother.  No more Claxton for me!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YGMK1W"">Fruit Cake Boxed 3 - 1 lb Dark Recipe Claxton Fruitcake</a>. Sandra C."
2,"I bought a couple locally because the price was right, and I liked the original/light versions of Arnold Palmer Half & Half.  But this wasn't very good...as another reviewer said, it's a little bitter and has an odd aftertaste.  Tastes like watered-down tea with artificial lemon flavoring even though it claims to contain juice.  I might drink this if I was really thirsty and nothing else was available, but it's not worth a purchase.  Stick with the originals."
2,"I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them.  I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty."
2,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."
2,"Label looks really cool, the drink is much smaller than anticipated. Shipping went perfect, and arrived on time, would buy from there again. Liquid inside is neon green in color."
2,"very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting"
2,"I tried several tricks to rid myself of my moles. I tried flooding them and using flares in their hole.. all with no success. I bought this trap last spring. It's now fall and I still have moles. As a matter of fact, it hasn't caught one mole yet!! I just got a couple kittens that I'm hoping will help me with the mole problem in the spring. I think my next trick will be to try those poisen worms or some people have suggested using wrigley chewing gum.... if none of those things work I may have to resort to dynamite!! If I do try another trap, it'll be one of those in-line traps...."
2,"Im a big licorice fan - especially soft and chewy. This Haribo is a great price so i tried it. It was very fresh and chewy but really has no flavor outside of a slightly chemical taste."
2,"After great experiences with Ancient Harvest Quinoa pastas I decided to try another brand of quinoa based pastas...while it's not as bad as some of the rice based pastas, it's not that great. Edible at best. A test bite from the boiling water at less than 5 minutes yielded something kind of mushy on the outside and firm on the outside. I decided to drain. After letting the 'pasta' rest for a few minutes it gained a better texture, not too pasta-like, but edible. The taste? Kind of bitter. Best to mask this with some garlicy sauce."
2,"I was surprised to have found this item.  I had been looking for it for quite some time as we spend alot of time travelling and want to bring our own creamers (hazelnut flavor) But when i received the order - I was a little disappointed for a few reasons:  (1)some of them had leaked into the carton and (2) the expiration date of item was September 09 (just two months away).  I guess that is why they only had three left to sell (expiration date was coming up).  I believe when advertising an item like this - the expiration of the item should be listed so that we can make a decision on whether to order it or not"
2,"I had to throw this out because it really didn't taste good. It's hard to describe the taste, but it didn't taste like anything that I've had in Japanese restaurants."
2,"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."
2,"This is a combination of hot chocolate and instant coffee.<br />Unfortunately the sweetness overpowers the taste.<br /><br />Should be able to make a better drink in the microwave using hot chocolate and instant coffee"
2,"Generally, I love coffee. I prefer hot coffee made from fresh ground beans and I drink it black. I've tried many of both iced coffee beverages and coffees with espresso shots from the big chain, and I've found them completely delightful, though expensive. Unfortunately, this canned, low-calorie Italian espresso style coffee drink is a no-go for me.<br /><br />I'm assuming this is to be served cool from the refrigerator, although I'm certain my reaction wouldn't be any different had I drank it at room temperature. The texture is unsatisfactorily grainy. The flavor is unpleasantly off, either from beans that aren't bold enough or from a mixture of ingredients that ruins the flavor of a good bean - either way, I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />It's a 50 calorie beverage; with a low 20mg sodium and 12g in carbs, so it balances out nutritionally for a coffee drink. The beet sugar is where it gets its 4g of fiber, its 10g of sugars and likely the peculiar graininess.<br /><br />This is a convenient on-the-go option for someone who likes coffee, but I like coffee, and I do not like this."
2,"I've been buying this product for about a year now, and this is the second time when it has had an off taste. I buy other flavors, but this is the only one with the occasional off taste. When it is good, it's very good. I may not take the chance on this flavor again."
2,"Maybe i'm spoiled having grown up around friends and family that caught and smoked fish...  i was quite disappointed by the lack of flavor and mushy texture of the product.  My wife and i were of the same opinion, and now she's insisting i smoke another salmon fillet like i purchased from the butcher block at our local Fred Meyer (essentially Kroger NW.)  IMHO, you can get much better offerings at more reasonable prices and serving sizes if you look around, let alone smoking your own.  Will NOT buy again."
2,"received this product thinking it would be a good deal.  opened one up, they have very little salt on them and taste stale.....would never buy again"
2,"Adds a richness to sauces but meat flavors do not come through.<br />Williams-Sonoma Demi-glace much better product"
2,"I have used Wellness Core for a long time.  I did a lot of research before choosing it.  However after getting a new bag that was moldy I started doing some research.  The company has been bought out and many many consumers have complaints about the quality control of the food now and in some cases their dogs have been getting sick on it.  I am not saying not to buy it but just beware that it is not the same company anymore."
2,"I've got a mini-Aussie/Blue Heeler mix, so she's a small/medium-sized dog at 25 lbs. She managed to chew the toy up in 20 minutes. So if you're dog's a strong chewer, don't waste your money! Great for dainty chewers, though, like my Corgi."
2,"I used to eat these when I was a kid and loved them.  You'd open the can and there would be two or three whole, flaky fillets inside with the skin still on.  They were excellent.  Perhaps I got a bad can this time, but these were just awful.  Like opening a can of cat food.  An unidentifiable mass of smashed fish meat.  Ick."
2,"I first started using Zipfizz about 2-3 years ago and enjoyed during that time period HOWEVER, I don't know if they changed something in the formula or what but now I cannot drink it without side effects. It use to give me the extra kick and energy I needed... through the morning... another through the afternoon. RECENTLY though when I drink just a small amount I get 'VERTIGO' which will last for a few days, actually causing me to miss 2 days of work. I fell ok when I am sitting or lying down, but when I stand I am dizzy and it lasts for days. Also, the muscles in the back and on the side of my neck ache, directly behind and below the back of my ears. This is still an after effect that has lasted since I first experienced this. After initially having the dizziness effect, a month later I wanted to put my theory to the test so I bought another box from my local Costco and took just a few drinks and AGAIN the same effects occurred causing me miss work. NOW I HAVE NEW INFORMATION - My 24 yr old son ( who occasionally would use Zipfizz ) has reported the same effect with his latest use of the product. This leads me to believe they have changed something... or there was ONE HUGE BAD BATCH of the stuff made somewhere. Draw your own conclusions, just my experience. Thanks, Don"
2,"I really like the other Ancient Harvest GF pastas.  I tried two boxes of this and varied cooking times, sauces, and experimented with a few other variables.  Without fail, anytime I had to re-heat the pasta, it fell apart when I stirred it.  I am the only person in the house who has to be GF so I am usually the only one eating the pasta.  It is kind of a pain to make a single serving of my pasta and a pot full for everyone else.  I like being able to make a few serving to refrigerate and have something for lunch the next day, but the way this pasta just crumbles creates a texture I can't stand.  It's tiny pasta pieces and sauce, which I haven't had with the other pastas.  It's also the only brand that I had trouble finding a good cooking time.  The box says 4 to 6 minutes, but that always left hard pasta, even when dropped in salted water that was at a rolling boil.  I would check minute by minute and it seemed to be different every time, and sometimes it seemed like only half the noodles were cooked well and the others were too hard or over-cooked.  I'm a decent cook and don't have that issue with the other AH pastas, GF pastas, or the wheat pastas I cook for the rest of the family.  I will skip the shapes and stick to the other pastas made by Ancient Harvest."
2,"I can get fresher figs right here in America.  Still, they were good."
2,"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy."
2,"I had high hopes for these bars... I am a huge chocolate wafer fan! I am familiar with protein/energy bars and knew going into it that there would more than likely be a hint of that chalky protein bar flavor... but it hit me like a brick wall with the first bite. Luckily my husband has tastebuds that are muted to flavor, so he has slowly been able to work through this box of protein bars so we weren't just throwing money away... but wow. Just overall very disappointing. I went by reviews before deciding to purchase these, and most reviews were awesome...  so I can only assume that these are just one of those bars that is hit and miss. Some are going to love it, others are going to hate it. Unfortunately, I am in the latter group for this one. (And as a side-note, I shouldn't even call this a protein bar since it only contains 13g protein --- my all time favorite protein bar contains 20g. Granted, 13g is still a lot... but if you can choke this down, surely you can choke down a 20g bar with more flavor. In the future I will stick with my tried and true Chocolate Mint Builder's bars.)"
2,"This is not a strong nor malty tea, the taste is average- nothing particular outstanding or  to applaude. I have not experience the ""decaffinated"" effects of this tea, although the words do  carry a placebo effect.<br />I have found tea package in America/Canada from Twining do not have same quality as the Twining sold in England:London/Heathrow Airports. Just not the same in terms of the flavour. Very deceiving as it does not indicate on the website as where it has been packaged."
2,"We bought this for a birthday cake.  It looks really cool, and is quite easy to make.  After we baked it, we took it out of the pan, and tried to flip it over carefully right side up.  This is when it fell into pieces.  Luckily, you can fix it with icing, but it is hard to do.  An easier way to make the cake would to just buy two different colors of cake (doesn't have to be chocolate and vanilla) and just do the same thing as with the Duff cake mix.  It is a great idea, but BAD mix!  Even the cupcakes were so crumbly they didn't hold together as cake, and made a big mess.  Skip the cost, buy your own separate cake mixes!"
2,"When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole ""greenwashing"" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it."
2,"I buy this same product at a local store for $4.99/12 oz. jar. And this store is typically more expensive than other local stores, but it carries hard to find items such as almond butter.<br /><br />Cheers!"
2,"When I saw all those chocolate chunks in Back To Natures Granola I got a little too excited.  I love me some chocolate and when it is in granola I can only imagine the orgasmic experience in my mouth.  I am sad to report that no orgasmic experience was to be had.  Upon first bite I noticed a great crunch but the flavor of the granola by itself almost had a raw taste to it, like a raw flour/oat taste and it was very off putting. Not at all sweet and that could be a plus for someone who is trying to not eat too much sugar but I need my granola to have some sort of sweetness to it which this granola did not have.  I had some of the chocolate in the mix and that by itself was very delicious but not worth the cost of the granola, will just get a chocolate bar.  I much prefer the Love Crunch Granola By Natures Path, that is absolutly scrumptious and has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor and pieces along with freeze dried berries, plus it is all organic.  So if you are looking for a nice flavorful granola that has nice chocolate goodness look elsewhere because you will not get that with this granola."
2,"I found the coffee to be too weak. I wonder what his Un-Jazzed Up coffee is like, it must be like drinking plain boiled water. This coffee is only good if you like your coffee weak or make a 6 oz cup maybe."
2,"These bags arrived all stuck together like they were old which they were not but they were not the quality that I grew up with with the hard crusty outer coating which encased delicious black licorice.  I will not be ordering this again."
2,"I was disappointed in this product. I had enjoyed truffle salt from another manufacturer, which had so much truffle that whenever I opened the lid, the delightful aroma filled the room. But it is no longer available, so I was hoping to find a similar product on Amazon. This ain't it; the truffle is barely detectible when sniffing the open bottle and not detectible on food at all. I'm debating whether to just throw it out so I can re-use the bottle to try a different brand. (The bottle is reusable, which is why I rated it more than one star.)"
2,"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours."
2,"I almost threw this loaf into the garbage when I first tasted it. Very horrible taste and texture. But I kept it in the fridge and toasted a slice every once in a while. I don't know whether it improved with age or I just got used to it, but eventually I ate the whole thing. I can't give it more than two stars though. I suggest the people who package this mix try another recipe, because the world needs a better low-carb bread mix."
2,"was looking for a low fat/sodium kosher/pareve snack but this product has no taste and I am very disappointed and will have to keep looking."
2,"We love these cookies, but not in crumbs.  Unfortunately, the pack of 3 came in crushed.  It would seem we are better off just buying them directly from a local store, instead of through Amazon."
2,"The back of the bag tells you to use two tablespoons or coffee for every 6 ounces of water when brewing this coffee. I did that, and the vanilla taste was very weak. This is strange, because my ground floor smelled strongly of vanilla after brewing, but you would not have known that from tasting the coffee itself.<br /><br />Since I had a week to use it after opening, I made it again and again each morning. With each passing day, the coffee would taste worse. Just the other day, I made some for a road-trip to the in-laws. My wife took a sip and said ""oh, that's bad,"" and never touched it again. Yep, there was something about this coffee that just did not jive. At all. I'm sorry Starbucks, I have nothing against you, this coffee was just a big disappointment."
2,"I had gotten these last year and they were not very good at all.  The receipe must have changed as I purchased a regular box and those tasted great!  So when I saw these individaul packages I just assumed they taste the same as a full size box and these do not.  I called Nabisco to complain and was told that each manufacuturing plant is processes differently sometimes as the equipment differs. I use to love these graham crakers but not anymore.  These were burnt on oneside, cracked and do not have that rich taste that they use to.  Nabisco has been around for years but at this rate, they will go out of business.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I forgot I had selected auto shipment and now I am getting yet another box that I never wanted to begin with.  Be very careful on what you select when it comes to shipping."
2,"the product was what i wanted however i was expecting to get a bigger pack i think it was quite expensive for a small pack"
2,"I can only call this stuff ""jerky-esque,"" because it is really not like any ""real"" jerky that I've ever had before. Easy to bite through and chew, but extremely processed and pressed into form. As alluded to in another review, the look and texture of the these is very reminiscent of jerky-treats that are made for dogs. Overall, I'd give the texture 2.5-3 stars....different...a bit odd...ok, but not really ""meaty.""<br /><br />Taste, I'd give 2 stars. They rate as edible, but certainly not good. Eating a full serving at one time tends to feel like a chore, so that should tell you right there that these things aren't too great. Not horrible, but not something I'd prefer to eat...<br /><br />Value. Decent, but in a subjective sense. You get a lot of product for the price....which is great if you happen to like them....but nothing to crow about if you don't...."
2,"This is the best I can find, but I live in Houston, and like another reviewer said, nothing works well.  But I have to use this once a week.  And it is more expensive here.  Get it at Wal-Mart."
2,"My dogs have not been too hard to please with food.  They will eat almost anything, but they have little interest in the 3 cases of this stuff I bought.  Maybe I should add something to it like salt?"
2,"Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith."
2,"I used to think this stuff was the best coffee around. Until I started trying various other brands, and grinding my own.  To which, I came to realize that at best, this stuff is average.<br /><br />Slightly above the canned stuff in the grocery store, thats it.  The other reviewer is right, it is ""Nutty"" in flavor, so you really need to love nuts or this one will turn you off. Secondly, it is fairly light roasted.  We tend to have more enjoyment from medium-dark to dark roasts.  This one doesn't have enough kick.<br /><br />This is a blend, which isn't really a good thing for coffee freaks. I tend to like beans from specific regions in the world, so blends really mess up my taste enjoyment.  Blends are generally for people that aren't too serious about Coffee."
2,"I liked the fact that this product has a simple ingredient list and I could find gluten and dairy free protein bars.  So after hearing much about these, I decided to try them.  I tried various flavors, but still I just don't like them.  The texture is probably the worst part, I just find it gross and gummy.  As for taste, they're rather bland.  I think there are better tasting healthy options out there.  As for me, I won't be purchasing these again."
2,"My husband really likes seaseme chips so I ordered 12 packages, however I only got a 11 packages and all were crushed. This was a very bad job packing box and shipping. I won't order again."
2,"The oil was fine but the glass bottle not stable due to small bottom surface with rounded edges. Thus it slipped off its shelf and shattered on the floor. Big waste, big mess. Luckily I like the odor because it soaked in. Big job to clean up with broken glass. Baking soda, I hope, will absorb the bulk of that which remains, staining my floor. And I can go out and buy a product that garages use in oil spill clean up. In the future I will buy only plastic-bottled sesame oil. And hope I remember to check the bottle's bottom for common-sense stability.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now, in August of 2012, I want to reiterate my observation of how unstable this glass bottle is. I wound up with a second bottle of this brand - it was given to me - and the same thing happened. It is simply not stable on the shelf or in the door of a refrigerator where I keep such oils due to their potential to become rancid at higher temperatures; nor would it be stable on a cupboard shelf. There are several other brands of sesame oil available."
2,"Nice gift box. However the pretzels were waxy with not a whole lot of flavor. Disappointed because there are a lot of good sugar free products out there. This is not one of them."
2,"I ordered this product on June 27, 2012 and received it June 29. The best by date stickered on the package is ""030712"". Assuming traditional month-day-year dating, that's almost four months past. Even if it's day-month-year dating, it's still close. I would not have even questioned the age of the product if the sticker wasn't there, but why add a 'best by' sticker if it's not needed...and why send it out if it's out of it's freshness period? Because I'm not the one consuming the product, I can't say if the product is bad or not, but I did notice that so far only ONE out of three of the treats I've used actually fits in the Romp n Chomp bone that I bought it for. This totally defeats the purpose of challenging the dog and giving him a treat that takes time to consume when I leave. Instead he grabs the refill treat and wolfs it down. Disappointing since he otherwise likes the bone. I'd hoped to be able to use it as intended with a treat insert once in awhile."
2,"I opened a can of this for my cats dinner and was totally disgusted.  I expected big chunks of sardines with shrimp and crab like the label says.  What I got was some sardines in a thick jelly with one shrimp.  I did not see any crab meat at all.  One cat ate most of it and one would have very little to do with it.  Not worth keeping at all.  This will go in the trash."
2,"I'm a big fan of chai tea, but I didn't like this particular combination at all. I didn't find it ""full bodied"" as the other reviewers suggested (when I think full bodied, I think PG tips, strong/robust/smooth)<br />This seems almost musky like, and a bit harsh (no, I didn't burn my tea)"
2,"First, these ""hot dogs"" are basically tastless but, on top of that, they are like biting into mush-ECH!<br /><br />Since a medical problem three years ago changed my diet, I have tried lots of ""vegan"" product substitues - hamburgers, beef and chicken bites, ham and more but this is by far the worst substitue product I have ever tried.<br /><br />I have no idea where the people reviewing this product are from (usually, a compamy only puts one or two ""ringers"" on the review page) but they have to have no taste what-so-ever.<br /><br />Maybe if Loma reduced the water content of the product, a firmer texture would definitly be an improvement.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it two stars is that, being vegan, I'm sure it won't kill me."
2,"I have purchased these freeze-dried natural chicken breast treats in the past from a few different suppliers so I know what to expect in terms of product characteristics & quality. I have a dentally-challenged senior cat who is diabetic (in remission), has a hyperthyroid condition & mega colon. He has lost several teeth so it was important that I find a treat for him that he likes that not only is natural, without additives or sugars but also has a soft, tender consistency that is easy for him to chew. These Real Food Toppers freeze-dried chicken breast pieces were the perfect solution & my cat loved them. They even print ""soft to chew"" right on the packaging. I found this 2-pack listing on Amazon with an outstanding discounted price so I decided my next order would be from Amazon (I also decided to make it an autoship subscription as well so saving even more $). Unfortunately, when the 1st shipment arrived I was quite disappointed to find chicken pieces that were dried up & hard -- maybe 15% of the pieces were soft enough to give my cat. In fact, because when I offer treats to my cat I normally have to break the large chunks into smaller bite-sized pieces, I found the majority of the product in this order to be so hard I could not even break them apart with my hands. If I attempted to cut them up into much smaller pieces with a knife so he could maybe chew those, the product simply disintegrated into crumbs. All 4 pouches in my order were the same unacceptable quality. I also determined that not a single one had a ""best by"" date on the packaging. Since every other package I'd ever purchased regardless of who the supplier was always had dates on them I figured these pouches must have been very, very old. Because I opened all 4 pouches thinking I'd eventually have to find some acceptable pieces I was unable to return the order. When I receive the 2d shipment if there are no dates on any of the pouches then I'll be returning the order (unopened) otherwise I'll open a pouch & if I find the contents unacceptable I'll return the shipment & cancel the remainder of the autoship subscription."
2,"This burger is OK. You can do better at a local store. Omaha's steaks are good.<br />Buy the steaks."
2,"Bought this at a local market, on sale thankfully, and am fully disappointed. It's bitter and doesn't have great olive flavor, though it is quite a beautiful green color. If you're looking for a mid-premium olive oil I'd recommend Alessi or Lucini way over this product and both are in the same price range."
2,"If you like really sweet chocolate bars, this might be for you.  However, it's advertised as special dark, which is false advertising.  It's only 45% cocoa; real dark chocolate is 70% or more.  This is a scam."
2,"I have been feeding this brand to my bulldogs for 2 years.  Petco stop carring it, so I have been buying from Amazon.  I buy two 30lb bags at a time.. I never thougth it would make by bulldogs sick.  I stop feeding them from that bag, and opened the new one after I had taken them to the vet and they eventually got better.  I ran out of the 2nd bag  so I put them back on original bag, and they started vomiting again..It's hard to see my pupps so sick, and don't know if I should keep buying this brand."
2,"I have had much, much better dried fruit. It's sorta rubbery and hard... much less tasty and delightful than other dried fruits i've had. It's just okay."
2,"6 months ago, I subscribed for a monthly ""Tart is Smart Tart Cherry Juice"" product.  Originally the cost for a 32oz. bottle was $16.99.  One month later, the cost went up to $18.99 - and now it is $25.99.  The product is not worth a $9.00 increase per month.  Lower the cost and I might subscribe again."
2,"The variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food. Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out. it seems to be little square bite size (for cats) pieces of a chicken-like item, in a broth, mostly broth. Each of my cats, one of whom is a fairly picky eater, both seemed to enjoy this food and ate it straight way. Seemed to enjoy I say, since it turns out my picky eater was actually only lapping up the ""soup"" or the sauce, and leaving behind the 8 or so little bits of meat like substance (it could actually be chicken, sure looked like it). And frankly, even with the manufacturer's recommendation of what would amount to 6 or more cans a day for my larger 12 lb cat, just not enough food there to satisfy him, mostly liquid.<br /><br />Chinese Chicken: Once again, fairly saucy, but with a much higher meat:sauce ratio, with what looked like a fair amount of shredded chicken. Once again, my picky eater just lapped up the sauce, and my other big guy, who eats anything, really was not interested, no matter how hungry he was.<br /><br />And please tell me why there are little tiny chunks of carrots in each of these? Cats have no interest in carrots, do they have some need for Vit A that is not fulfilled in the supplementation of this food? I doubt it, that is in there for us humans... stupid.<br />I gave this two stars instead of one, because one of my cats quite liked the sauce."
2,"We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied.  Recently, they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines.  I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling.  At the time Melita made these changes, I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good.  Accordingly, I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars.  We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee."
2,"Tasted artificial, weird, unnatural.  Could not detect the orange peel ""note"" at all.  Singular, not balanced.  Very pretty color and pleasant aroma. Unfortunately, I sent it back ):"
2,"I have been buying turkey snack bites for several months. I have enjoyed them tremendously until this last shipment. Most of the bites were mushy inside the skin of the turkey bite. Now they are dog treats.I have wasted my money because I can't eat them. I really miss the old kind (like the shipment before this one).........Pam Hodges"
2,"the vita coco brand is by far my favorite brand of coconut water-- but i'll stick with the plain!!! this flavor tastes ok upon 1st sip-- but then it has the wierdest most icky aftertaste!!! it's pretty darn disgusting."
2,"These truffles are not very good.  They are not smooth chocalate like others, they have a gritty texture and not as flavorful as some of the other truffles that I have purchased. I don't recommend..."
2,"I bought this because it said NO SUGAR ADDED.  It did not state that it had the fake sugar sucralose in it.<br />I can not use it and sent it to a food cupboard in my area.  I will be more careful in the future.  The front of the package should say contains sucralose!"
2,"Of the 34 K-Cups, there was only 10 varieties.  We received about 6 of the same French Vanilla and Hazelnut.  Just like everyone said, order just thrown in a box."
2,"As I reported to Amazon previously the packaging was terrible. alot of loose sugar inside the box. When I opened the shipping carton My wife and I noticed the original Splenda box was not properly sealed. The Splenda box was literally unsealed and open. It made us leary to think that someone might have tampered with the shipment. As of today no harm has come. The sugar is the same. The quantity is wonderful. The price well I've seen it for less."
2,"I love Flamin' Hot Cheetos and was expecting a healthier version of it in this.<br /><br />Saw a review on lifehacker or some other blog about these puffs. They were raving about it so I had to try.<br /><br />Nowhere near as spicy as Flamin' Hot. I got sick of these cause I had to finish off 12 bags of it. I gave a bag to some friends and they liked it.<br /><br />If you are looking for Flamin' Hot kick, these don't have it. More peppery if anything. Okay cheese flavor."
2,"This Earl Grey tea is just ok.  The bergamont flavor is muted and dull which caught me by surprise.  I was expecting better from this product as it is marketed and packaged as high end.  Also, the tea leaves are broken and not full leaves."
2,"In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a ""real"" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than ""real"" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to ""real"" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists."
2,"Very happy to have found these as they are my husbands favorite...but purchase to give as a gift...they expired so soon after arrival they were not good for long after they were given.  The result was to freeze them, then they were forgotten. Will not order again. Oh well."
2,"I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first."
2,"I love pomegranate, I love licorice, I love natural and organic things, and I love just about every Newman's product I've ever had. And it looks like a lot of other people love these. To me, these taste like medicine. I think it's the elderberry that's in them. When I'm sick, I drink that stuff like crazy so I think for me, elderberry and medicine are inextricably linked at this point.<br /><br />But really, why is there elderberry in these? I really wanted a nice tart pomegranate flavor and I feel like I can barely taste it. Even my sweets-obsessed 3 year old didn't like these. I'll try the black ones next. Hopefully they are better."
2,"Shipping is terrible. I've paid for 24 cans of this chew to arrive in two days(due friday) and it arrives the following week monday! But on top of that, it seems that there are a few cans that have less than others. Not worth the money."
2,"Well, I tried this because I wanted my cat to eat more healthy.  He is used to Fancy Feast and Friskies.  He is a male, 13 yrs old.  When he smelled it he started to seem reluctant, like ""what the heck is this?""  Then he decided to try it.  He ate a little and walked away.  Just enough to vomit it back up on my carpet.  It came up just like it went down, in little balls.  I don't know what the problem is, but he definitely won't eat it.  I will try to mix it with some wet food, hopefully he will eat it."
2,"When I received the package, I was excited to see what was included.  I pulled out all of the K-cups out of the brown paper bag (what is up with that?) and as I was doing so, I noticed some of the cups rattling.  To see why these were rattling, I opened up one of the K-cups to discover a hard brown lump of coffee sitting on the bottom of the cup, yuck!  I took pictures of the cup to upload to the review; however, that option is not available on Amazon's site.  Believe me, it was not pretty!"
2,"The product seemed fresh on arrival but is sort of 'gummy' in texture. Didn't taste very good so I just threw it away."
2,"You pay for what you get. This product is Pure CoCoNuT water...It does taste Authentic If that's what you Like But it was not for me. I Love the Vita CoCo though, The mixed drinks are more what I prefer. But I was expecting something a little more pleasant but it's a bit tart and diety?(if that's a word)But It is no doubt good for you and 100% better than Sports as far as Rehydration and Regulation of ur BP.I just don't like the Taste =("
2,"I live in a rural area where it can be difficult to get even the store brand grated cheese, and so I was hoping to solve that problem by finding a good brand online. I certainly wasn't expecting gourmet quality, just something adequate.<br /><br />When I read the reviews of this product, I was very hopeful. I am not a fan of Kraft grated cheeses, and never buy them. So when people said in their reviews of this product that they felt this was better than Kraft grated cheese products, I hoped it might be comparable to the local store brand, which is actually quite good. I was VERY disappointed. This cheese is sharp, but lacks any of the richness and more subtle flavors of even a moderately good parmesan, and is extremely dry. I find I don't cook as much pasta as I used to because this cheese is so disappointing. Everyone who knows me knows that I really enjoy cheese on my pasta, but I will go without before I will waste my money on this again."
2,"These are my favorite candies and I only know of a select few stores that carry them. I was happy to see them online at a very good price, but was disappointed because the candies were not fresh. When I compared the candies to the store bought candies I noticed that the ones I bought from amazon were hard and stale while the candies from the stores were noticeably much fresher and chewier."
2,"i regularly purchase the glennys ranch flavored soy crisps. they must of changed their baking process. the last 4 cases have lacked flavor, and are not as crisp. they tase the same as regular<br />soy crisps."
2,"Look, I know there are nasty tasting whole earth raw shakes out there that are seriously nasty, and as an industry we've come a long way in flavor with these, but this vanilla ice cream powder is so nasty that I cannot describe it other than to say that it smells like a cheap ""buttercream cupcake"" candle, and it tastes like a whole truckload of quarters and fake Splenda sweetener rusting in your mouth...the way your mouth is cold when you haven't slept all night, like all that nasty at the same time.<br /><br />Now with all that said, the chocolate ice cream flavor is the best ever!! I make it as an after gym hot chocolate breakfast and it's just delicious and it works like even I can't believe. Get the chocolate and give it a little more water than it calls for, it's great.<br /><br />Gonna try the strawberry one next, hopefully it's like the chocolate one."
2,"Well i bought a pack of 8 because i couldnt find this specific flavor in any store, liquor, or gas station. its a nice grape flavor with a hint of other fruitiness which i happen to enjoy.i happen to be a big Monster Energy fan and was really craving this specific kind of monster but damn! i didnt know the shipping would be more than the price of the product!! never buying these again!"
2,"The name ""Good Earth"" is somewhat deceiving.  The third ingredient for this tea is ""Artificial Flavor"".  The tea is quite good, but I don't want artificial anything in my tea."
2,"Ordered this product to have some canned pumpkin--continuing pumpkin shortage at stores. Use A LOT of pumpkin! of 12 cans, 9 majorly dented, 2 minorly dented, 1 OK. Amazon refunded entire purchase price--they don't accept grocery returns."
2,"These were not fresh and the packaging was questionable. They were packed in a single cardboard box. Inside was a single large plastic bag that was completely unsealed. Considering this is a food product I would expect the package to be sealed for cleanliness, to preserve freshness, and to avoid major spillage when opening the box. Apparently they couldn't even be bothered to use a twist tie. Will not be making any addtional purchases from Hickory Harvest."
2,"I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again."
2,"I tried this product because it is advertised as ""natural"", but how can it be natural if it has artificial flavors and coloring?<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: artificial butter flavor, soy lecithin, and beta carotene for color. **Contains: Milk and Soy Ingredients<br /><br />*fail*"
2,"I had some peanutbutter flavored dog treats before and my dog loved them but they weren't in their original package and when they ran out, I didn't know the brand.  Apparently these are not nearly as flavorful because she hardly ever chews them, and I'm left with 2 big bags--guess they will last a looong time."
2,"however the dogs went crazy for these. I'll probably order more in the future if I can find a good deal. Fyi, they are pig snouts, so if you are squeemish...<br />*Petco did refund my money, so all is good."
2,"I got Teriyaki pack which is an ok flavor, I feel it is on the salty side. The main problem is the shape and texture of the meat. I dont get it why it is made it into the same size strips? that seems unnatural. The only possible answer I can think of is they try to cover up the low quality and different part of meat they mix together, so the texture is somewhat disgusting as the result. Every piece of the jerky is hard to chew, they should have trimed the meat and removed the membrane, but they did not, so you can taste that and chew on that forever. I had to spit it out eventually."
2,"I got this to go with the HCG diet - Not much flavor.  I tried chocolate and English Toffee - both had more flavor.  Difficult to find in stores -and much more expensive in stores.  Worth it to have a different flavor - but if only buying a couple buy a different flavor.  Ones that come in packages of 2 are a better deal.  Find a friend and split!"
2,"I thought these were gnocchis not plain old pasta. They do cost as much as gnocchis though... I guess De Cecco took some liberties on what they call gnocchi."
2,"I was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin.  The listing did not say how much was in the tin (my fault I guess). I just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only $4.95.  This is good stuff, but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less."
2,"i bought 80 bucks worth of this because of the other reviews of this product. my cat won't eat it. period. so just like in people, taste is subjective. buy a small amount and try it out first. hopefully your cat will love it. i'm sure it is a good product quality-wise, which is why i didn't rate it lower."
2,"The Prepara Herb Savor Pod is advertised holding asparagus. That was why I purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. In reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  The ad is misleading. I'll keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question."
2,"I bought a box of these baked barbeque Kettle brand chips from Amazon in somewhat larger-sized bags, because they came so highly recommended by other reviewers, but I really don't care for them at all (though other people to whom I've offered them  munch through them quite happily, and are pleased to take the rest of the bag home with them when I make the offer).  I can only conclude that individual palates may respond very differently to these particular chips.<br /><br />So, if you've bought a bag of Kettle's baked chips in this particular flavor recently in your local grocery store and found them quite tasty, you'll probably be quite happy with buying these by the box-full from Amazon.<br /><br />However, if you haven't yet tried them, do NOT invest in a multi-bag shipment until you first discover whether or not these particular chips appeal to your particular palate.<br /><br />I'm busy giving away every bag I bought, because I developed a distaste for them after eating the first few chips from the first bag I opened (which I ended up throwing away half-full).  But my dislike for these baked barbecue-flavor chips from Kettle brand (whose other, 'full-fat' chips I've almost always relished) is definitely a minority opinion among my friends and neighbors, so far."
2,"I wish I had bought 11oz instead of 44... read the reviews thinking it would be better, and cheaper, than Starbucks Columbia. Wrongo.<br /><br />It's strong, but too strong. Tastes like super hotel coffee when you grind the beans yourself. I made a few pots and poured the last one out. Gave it away.<br /><br />I'm particular what I put into my body, and this brew offends me. The smell is great though, just great. If only the taste parred with it.<br /><br />It's a taste all of it's own. Way too strong of taste for not enough zing.<br /><br />2 Stars. It's still better than the cheap stuff."
2,"Although I love Numi teas, the flavor from the tea bags is very weak for aged earl gray. I will keep this first shipment though will look for a brand with more flavor."
2,"Timothy's World is your ""average, but nothing amazing"" company when it comes to K-Cup products.  This green tea is not much of a change.<br /><br />The flavor is there, but it tastes along the lines of your Bigelow and other cheaper greens.  I would definitely pick Gloria Jeans over this on my personal scale, but it's a nice change in pace if you constantly drink greens and want to add some variety."
2,"Flavor wise, these are merely ok.  There is nothing great here.  In fact, these bars taste generic and slightly cheap to be honest.  I actually found the peanut butter flavor to be the predominant flavor, overpowering the chocolate, so apparently my taste is different than ShannonAnna, who said that she couldn't taste the peanut butter at all.  Either way, the flavor of the actual rolled oats themselves is a tad bland and chalky almost.  The chocolate underbelly isn't that rich either.  All in all, these are decent but underwhelming, and their size is pretty small, so they aren't all that filling either.  I am very calorie conscious as of late, and so I excited to have a low calorie snack to munch on, but once this box is through I don't see myself buying another."
2,"I had never heard of Stephen's and was excited to see the great reviews. Unfortunately, the target audience of one, who drinks hot choc daily, didn't particularly like this variety, so I now have six cans of the stuff guaranteed to last for a long, long time."
2,"The production description did not mention the size of the traps. SAFER previously sold ""Sticky Whitefly Traps"", which I liked a lot but couldn't find in my store any more. So I ordered these traps, assuming that the size of the traps would be similar. But these traps (1.25""x3.75"") actually came less than 1/5 of the size of the previous traps (6""x4""). Besides, these traps are only sticky on one side, while the previous ones were sticky on both sides. So counting the sticky surface, these traps are 1/10 of the size, but I paid 1/2 of the price comparing to the previous ones. These did come with stakes which were not included with the previous product, but I don't seem to care much for them. I think the size information will be very helpful for consumers to decide whether the product meets their needs."
2,"NOTE: This is a review of this coffee in the K-cup format, not of Amazon's packaging.  However, I have never had trouble with the Frustration-free packaging; I simply cannot comment in this case.<br /><br />Reviewer's preferences: Strong, medium-dark roast coffees, mid-to-heavily sweetened with whole milk (4:1 ratio or a little heavier toward the coffee side).  I occasionally add a hint of vanilla syrup and cream or half-and-half if a coffee is overly bitter.<br /><br />I picked up this coffee in a large sampler box of Coffee People ""Extra Bold"" K-cups, which I have just finished off.  The collection contained the following blends/coffees: Wake-up Call, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, and Organic.  I have had each coffee multiple times.  From the four, I give the Organic blend the top spot with a slight edge over Black Tiger (we're talking 9.1/10 over 9.0/10 here).  Both the Black Tiger and Organic were strong and bold in flavor but not too bitter, while the Wake-up Call tended to be a little more harsh on the palate.  The Jet Fuel blend was appropriately named, as it almost always required a little vanilla and more milk or even heavy cream to make it palatable.<br /><br />Qualities of Coffee People Jet Fuel:<br />Dark, almost burned coffee flavor (think bad Sumatran roast).  Heavy bitterness that overwhelms the flavor, harsh on the back of the tongue and a fully bitter aftertaste, but probably drinkable if you are a fan of Sumatran or French Roast coffees.  Medium acidity, a little tangy but not really sour, with an earthy flavor that tends toward muddy.  Flavor envelops the entire mouth, but generally overwhelms the palate.  Heavy body, but not sludgy, though your mouth may be convinced otherwise from the flavor.  While I can and sometimes do drink other coffees black (mostly full-bodied medium roasts), I can't imagine anyone drinking this black even if they take their espresso that way.  Requires sweetener and cream/half-and-half or a heavy addition of milk.  Personally, I had to use a small splash of vanilla syrup to hide the bitterness.  Drinkable, but just barely with better choices available. Hard to find the good qualities in the disappointing profile.  Certainly not the WORST dark roast I have had, however.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars for one reason.  If you were using this coffee as an ingredient where you wanted the coffee and perhaps the bitterness to not be hidden too much, then this would be an excellent choice over many harsh Sumatran and French Roast coffees."
2,"chips were very good but there must have been a shipping problem all the chips were in small pieces"
2,"I take in stray cats. I currently have 14. When one comes down with something possibly contagious, all go on antibiotics. The other week I picked up some antibiotics at the vet and then went and got these at the pet store ($8!!!).  I was so happy that pilling this many cats was finally going to be so simple and easy for a change.<br /><br />Imagine my shock and annoyance when 10 of the 14 refused to eat them. The four that like them, love them, but the rest smell them and walk away."
2,"I have three cats.  One of them will eat these but only half-heartedly and I find the remains of some left behind so they are not a big hit."
2,"This so-called Tom Kah soup only resembles the ""real thing"" vaguely, by the fact that it contains coconut milk.  It is thin and watery, doesn't have enough vegetables in it, and its flavor is pleasant but not distinguished.<br />It doesn't compare to the Tom Kah soup served at my local Thai restaurant, nor for that matter, to my homemade version. I will use all these cans as a  base and add white meat chicken, thinly sliced onions, more carrots, lime juice, more lemongrass, fish sauce and hot sauce - then I will have true  Tom Kah soup.  In other words, practically start from scratch. I won't buy any more of it, that's for sure!"
2,"My son is 5 months old and teething (no teeth yet). The first and second time we gave him these biscuits, they broke into several pieces within about 20 minutes, one time leaving a big chokeable piece in his mouth. I think they are too thin and not sturdy enough to be used for gumming/sucking."
2,"They missed the mark here. This does not have any real ingredients. If you gave this to your dog as a treat it would be ok. This misses the mark for dogfood. My dog did gobble this down because it was something new. For my dogs overall health this does not work. I think that you should read the packaging then see what you think is good for your dog."
2,"These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like Lays. The cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health."
2,"I like the product, but why would amazon sell an item that expires soon. They should provide the expiration date before you buy."
2,"While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children.<br />If you're going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother?"
2,"this is an item that should have arrived in a chilled condition. There was inadequate chilling material in the styrofoam box and the sauces were warm. It is not known whether the items were safe to consume."
2,"The drinks are excellent although I just got two cases of them and they are all expired! Check the labels. They expired april 2012 and its almost june 1. Check this out first. I called amazon and they are sending me non expired ones I hope now."
2,"Great product.  But was disappointed in the delivery.  Was supposed to arrive on 11th didn't get until 14th.  Everything else I order is here by the day they say if not earlier.  It arrived at slc 80 miles from my home on the 10th. Yet it took 4 days to go 80 miles.  Go figure snail mail ups and usps."
2,"I'm a huge fan of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C"">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and was excited to try out Gold Kili Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage.  I usually add lemon juice to my Ginger Honey Crystals anyways...why not try a brand that has it included?  You can drink it either hot or cold - I added hot water to mine, as I like ginger tea.  To my dismay, the Kili Ginger Lemon Bev was not very good.  The ginger has a very light kick, and wasn't as spicy as most ginger teas.  The lemon flavor was overpowering.  They should rename this the Lemon & Ginger Bev mix, as that's what it tasted like to me.  Even after adding a little milk and honey to it, it still didn't have a good flavor.  If you like the Ginger Honey Crystals, you probably won't like the Gold Kili brand...it's not particularly gingery and the lemon is too strong.  You're better off adjusting the lemon and honey ratio on your own."
2,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LLXBCO"">Gourmet Popcorn Seasoning Assortment</a>I got some popcorn and seasoning salt in the same package by/from Wisconsinmade.  The popcorn popped up quite nicely in my hot air popper.<br /><br />The seasoning salt was was much too coarse to stick to the popcorn--even when I used vegetable oil spray.  I bought a mortar and pestle to re-grind the salt down to a fine grain like the size of butter-flavored popcorn salt from the grocery store. When I get the mortar-pestle, I will grind the salt down to the size it should have been in the first place.<br /><br />It is an inexpensive product and not worth the hassle to send it back.  The popcorn seasoning salt likely the worst designed/made product I ever bought from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have only tried one flavor so far.  The grain size was so far off the mark, I have no problems writing this less-than-positive review.  Man has been grinding salt for at least 5000 years, it is not that complicated to differentiate between rock salt, table salt and a finely ground powder."
2,"I cannot detect any vanilla flavor at all in this tea, instead it tastes like cloves."
2,"Mostly decaf. I won't order this mix again. While I knew there would be a few in the mix I assumed it would be mostly caffeine. Lots of teas. At least 2 of the cups are past the ""best before"" date. One of the cups had been cut open & had leaked coffee grounds in the package. I'm not very satisfied."
2,"didnt really like this oil, i know its good for your health, but didnt like the taste when added to food, or when i made a dressing for salad.  smoked up the house, when i cooked some fish in a pan with it, even on medium heat."
2,"I like Dunkin Donuts, Starbux, peets, and pure Kona coffee (for weekends, when I can enjoy the cup). 8 O'clock Coffee is horrible. It tastes like office coffee, even when freshly brewed. It has a rough texture, unsatisfying aroma, and very light beans in general. I'm giving away the coffee for free becuase it's horrible."
2,"If you regularly buy these chips, you would be like me and say, ""that's a great deal!""  These chips are not cheap at the stores, but they are fresh.  The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box... but for some reason they are not fresh, and the salt on the chips is all at the bottom.  I kept thinking that it was ""just that one bag..."" but it was all of them.  I had eaten too many of them to send them back.  Do not buy this product from Amazon- but... my shipment may be the unlucky one that was stale- although i read several other reviews sharing my opinion... and i did not believe!"
2,"This stuff has great packaging. The product has barely and flavor at all. It is like drinking watered down Swiss MIss hot coco. I don't recommend it."
2,"We have been giving our 100 pound shepherd/lab/collie/husky mix Hip Action since he was a pup. Our vet believes this is realy going to help him prevent all the hip problems that shepherd's usually have. Eventhough I cannot buy it locally, I make sure to buy it on line so my boy will remain healthy and happy!"
2,"I ordered Sprouting Mix Clover, Alfalfa, Fenugreek, And Radish, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)<br />But the NONE of the packet has Alfalfa seeds, even in the back of the packet Ingredient: Crimson Clover + Fenugreek + Radish seeds only..<br />So there is no Alfalfa seed in the packet, I see only 3 types of seeds...This is bad selling.."
2,"I was under the impression that the guanabana fruit was similar to the atis fruit, it's not.  Close, but no.  It's a good juice.  I just didn't like it that much."
2,"I bought this nori to have friends over to make sushi. It works well enough for the purpose of keeping your sushi rolled up, but in terms of the flavor of the nori itself, it is not very good. It has sort of a heavy, bitter flavor. I prefer a lighter nutty flavored nori."
2,"This Barista Prima Italian roast is suppose to be full bodied with a sweet edge.  It is not.  It is Medium-Bold (not extra bold), and has a bitter taste and a distinct aftertaste.  Milk & sugar help, but the bitter and aftertaste are still there.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512"">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> is a much better choice if you want a good Italian blend.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers."
2,"Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all."
2,"Sorry but hulless must not mean without hulls.  It was loaded with hulls and was very dry. Popped ok but will not reorder."
2,"The Directions indicate ""Heat 6oz of water or milk"" ""Stir in 3.5 Tbsp. of cocoa mix""...<br /><br />It is entirely too sweet and difficult to dissolve those amounts. It probably should be 3.5 Tsp (teaspoons) THEN each package could reasonably yield 8 servings. I've played around with the amounts to suit my liking BUT this is an expensive experiment not likely to be repeated."
2,"First time I purchased from this company and very disappointed as the coffee came all lose in the shipping box..Not even in their original manufacturers Keurig Tully Boxes.. some tops ripped open due to the packaging not to mention there are no expiration dates on these K-Cups.. Maybe this deal was too good to be true.. Do not recommend.. rather pay little more for quality packing and product...:("
2,"I am not a coffee snob but craved coffee when I am pregnant, so I ordered some decaf.  I have to say i never touched again and its not worth the trouble ( not much of course) of making it"
2,"When I received this product it came with the wrong directions, but hey, in this modern day the internet can fix this situation... except that it can't. I tried several you tube videos, many blogs, they all seemed to have the same directions for milk kefir grains. These directions did not work for my purchased grains, and I did try a number of times. I gave up because who really has the time to trouble shoot something that should be very simple.<br /><br />After being contacted by the seller (who seems concerned and helpful) I learned that with this product you really have to let the seller guild you through the process, hold your hand, because their grains are just that much more potent then anyone elses. Also, you shouldn't expect to be able to drink more then 1/2 a cup every week or two because these grains are just that potent.... of course after 4 rounds in milk my grains didn't grow... so maybe mine weren't that potent.<br /><br />In the end I didn't have a lot of time to commit to dealing with Lifetime Kefir. If you want yummy digestible kefir instead of milk in your smoothies and on your granola DO NOT BUY THIS, buy another product, with instructions, that seems to match other's opinions of what kefir's potency should be for someone who enjoys it.<br /><br />But if you do have the time and you don't like to drink a lot of Kefir but want the benefits this is PERFECT for you. The seller is very responsive and helpful and very concerned with your happiness. But you do have to take the time to have a conversation over email instead of just looking up the solution yourself."
2,"So the packaging was not correct for ""food"" items, the gummy bears were all stuck together onto one side, all gross. And they were cooked almost hott and gross. Im going to have to go buy new gummy bears to put into the jar. Not worth the money. Get a normal jar for gummy bears."
2,"Personally, I love this passion tea and drink a couple of cups a day so I go through a lot of tea. I started looking around to find a more affordable source of the tea and thought Amazon would be just the place. Not true!<br />I can get the same box of tea, 20 count, for under $4.00 a box where this is about $6.00 a box. Not a good deal!"
2,"I think the chocolate chip cookie mix just really isn't that good, Pamela's Incredible Chocolate Chunk Cookies Mix is fantastic, probably better than any other chocolate chip cookie even with gluten.<br /><br />1. What is that taste? I think it is too much xanthan gum - it is this fake sickly sweet flavor that leaves an aftertaste on your tongue like those fake sugars or Stevia. If you just eat one cookie it's not a problem, but eat a few too many and you might just be wishing for anything to remove the taste. (I bake a lot and in my opinion one of the problems with a lot of recipes is that they call for too much xanthan gum - you can get a great affect with much less. Unless you are using a mix, and then you have no choice.)<br /><br />2. not enough/not big enough chocolate chips<br /><br />3. my batches wound up really really chewy, like gnaw on it/exercise your jaw chewy. some people liked this, others didn't.<br /><br />So, if this is the only one you can get then go for it but if you have other options I would try those."
2,"I need to drink more water and thought this would help. It tastes so artificial and now Im stuck with a couple of boxes sadly."
2,"My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is ""made with liver"".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken ""by-products""-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide."
2,"While I have been pleased with some of the Kyjen toys, this puzzle was a disappointment.  My Mensa-smart Cattledogs figured out the game immediately, opening the flaps just fine.  But after a couple good retrievals the older dog looked at me as if to say, ""Are you kidding me?"", inserted a toenail into the top hole of this thing, and flipped it over to get the treat.  I'm going to try gluing it to a board so he can't cheat.  But overall, I'd say this is for very small dogs or slow ones."
2,"my cat, Rosie, was having loose stools, diarreah, etc on and off. I finally found the best cat food for her and thought we were done with her intestinal bouts. I had not given her Greenies for a few months and never thought that 4 to 5 of those little treats could cause a problem.....I was wrong.<br /><br />She has only been back on Greenies for a week and once again, diarreah.....and she is a long haired Ragdoll, so imagine the mess!! I'm taking her to the vet today to rule out anything else, but I've got this gut feeling that Greenies and Rosie do not agree with each other.<br /><br />My male cat has no problem with them. So, I'm not saying Greenies are bad for every cat, but maybe some cats are too sensitive to their ingredients.....<br /><br />anyway, always, always look at your pet's food when their health declines in anyway......its the single most important thing we do for them everyday.<br /><br />oh....and as far as tartar and dry food/treats keeping their teeth healthy....that's bunk! that would be the equivalent of saying that if humans eat pretzels, their teeth will stay clean.....it does not work that way with US or our pets. You must brush their teeth, or take them to the vet for that."
2,"I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />This is about the saltiest of the Compleats I've tried. The potatoes are pasty and have little flavor. The meatloaf isn't bad, except for the salt factor."
2,"My baby will eat just about anything....usually! For some reason, she won't eat these. Now I'm just left with a bunch of baby food taking up space in my cabinets. I suggest trying out the flavors individually before buying this package."
2,"I was disappointed in the quality of this coffee.  It has a weird whang to it - a bitter taste.  My husband tried it and said the same thing.  I don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but I won't be using this coffee except for emergency backup (when I'm out of good coffee)."
2,"If you have a dog, you probably know the distinctive ""dog fart"" odor.  This food, for some reason, multiplied that for one of my two dogs.  It really turned our house into a constant dog gas zone.  Wow.  It's supposed to be a pretty good dry dog food, but beware of the possibility of DOG GAS."
2,"Yes, they should say artificial rose water flavor.  I thougt it was natural where it says rose flavor.  Flavor usually means artificial unless it says natural flavor though.  This flavor is probably distilled from petroleum.  Maybe I'll use it to scent handkerchiefs or something.<br /><br />I just assumed that after paying $4 for one bottle and it being from an ethnic store, maybe they wouldn't know about making it with artificial flavor.  I must tell you, after one sip, I can't stand any more.<br /><br />It says no preservatives, so it gives you that natural vibe impression.  I guess if it had real rosewater, it would have preservatives.  I feel like I have been tequiyaed.<br /><br />If you drink this stuff you may end up hating the whole idea of rose water for life."
2,"Like other reviewers I found these to be way to salty. They do not need to add extra salt when cheese already has enough on it's own. If they change the recipe I will be more than happy to try again but not the way they are now."
2,"I like apricots... so I don't know if it was the fact that the apricots were liquefied into this apple sauce mix, or something else, but these cups had a nasty aftertaste to them, kind of like dirt.<br /><br />I definitely won't be buying this flavor again, but other LeRoux Creek flavors such as cinnamon apple are very good."
2,"I had been eying the Popchips brand for some time but I they seemed too expensive and I passed. So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."
2,"I got this for my husband, and he drank a few of these pods, and has yet to use anymore. I think this coffee is too weak, so less water is recommended. Thanks for the free sample, it's fun trying new things. This isn't the best of coffee's yet it's worth a try. Update: I cut up five packets, and put it in a five cup filter, with full amount of water, and the coffee brewed perfectly and tasted really good. I tried this instead of using the one shot packets, and it worked for me."
2,"While the beans can be overly soft, their flavor and quality are very good. Eden Organics is one of the few companies that use safe BPA-free can lining. Unfortunately, several of the cans in my recent order arrived dented. The outer box was not damaged, just the cans. Since denting compromises the safety of the contents, these had to be thrown out. I will not be ordering this online again--I'll go back to selecting individual cans in my local market."
2,"There is nothing ""extra bold,"" or even ""regular bold"" about this coffee.  On the other hand, if you like your coffee meek and weak, you may well like this.  This comment isn't meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, I'm just stating that this is not ""extra bold"" at all.  If you want your coffee ""slap your face"" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example."
2,"I guess I thought this Italian Breaded Veal Patty would taste like the ones I've had at restaurants but it does not!  It left a greasy, discusting taste in my mouth.  I thought maybe Omaha Steaks had taken very fatty veal and ground it up to make these patties.  All I know is....I think this product is awful.  I will never buy this veal product again."
2,"While the smell is amazing, the taste is lacking compared to other Earl Gray Teas. This is the case for most of Teavana's teas, when your in the store they waft the smell of the tea toward you and your like WOW I bet that tastes amazing.... then you later taste it and its only ok... The Earl gray is not very traditional compared to other teas like Twinings and Harriods... Being from London and growing up on earl gray this tea is not horrible but there are better teas out there. Its seems like an American twist on an English classic, but if your like me and like that traditional English taste, this is not the way to go."
2,"I was dissappointed in using the PODs as 1/3 of them were defective and left me with ""dirty water"" in my cup..the ones that were not defective were fine."
2,"Excellent product, flimsy packaging by mfr (biscuits crumble when opening the packet), good packaging (box and air pillows) by Amazon.  However this time Amazon shipped items a month prior to the product expiration date which is a form of dumping rather than returning to the mfr for newer product."
2,"If you want heat and don't give a damn what it tastes like, or plan to add it as a minor ingredient just to add heat, then this is your sauce. It is hotter than hell's kitchen. However if you plan to use it as a sauce, or want to add FLAVOR to your food, get something else. it is fowl tasting and bitter."
2,"I cannot recommend this Hot Paprika Tin. It's not HOT and has very little flavor. Only things I can think that it might be used for is to color soup red. After using it 3 times, I threw it in the trash."
2,"The title for this item is confusing, it says 2 boxes of 12 cakes. That means you get 24 Sno-Ball packages, right? Wrong. You get 6 Sno-Ball packages and they do not come in boxes other than the shipping carton. These could be purchased much cheaper from any local stop-and-go market or gas station. The vendor did refund me $5 for the confusion but I was still very disappointed."
2,"Regular Reduced fat milk from Horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date. My intention was to buy Whole milk but the product description is confusing. I sent an email to the customer support - no response, after 3 weeks I checked and found that they made the picture larger (good) but left the product description without change.<br />As for me, it is crazy expensive shipping while I can get same Fat free or Reduced fat milk at StopNShop or Market Basket. The difficult thing is to find whole milk. Funny that Whole milk as natural product became unpopular. I guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight:)"
2,"Not very please with the green mountain hot cocoa product, lacking a good chocolate taste, even when you mix two of them together it doesn't make it better.  Will never buy these again, best kind is the Grove Square or Swiss Miss k-cups."
2,"I adopted a dog recently from a rescue organization - a pit bull/mastiff 3 year old - who came to me fat, happy and with an overall positive outlook on life, regardless of the fact that his owners had left him to rot in an abandoned apartment building.<br /><br />Being a first time dog owner, I put him on this food because it came recommended to me by my local pet store in Austin, TX and it was the cheapest quality dog food (by weight) there.  The dog ate this food for about three weeks and every single time I put it out in a bowl, he would devour it right away.  He eats really fast and this food does not cause him to choke or spit the food back up - although now, three weeks later, I almost wish he had.<br /><br />In about two weeks time, I began to notice patches of fur gone in his coat and LOADS of shedding everywhere in my small apartment.  I was using the Furminator to shed him about twice a week and one time, I drew blood.  He was also scratching and licking himself raw.  Within three weeks, his collar had gotten too big for him - meaning, of course, rampant weight loss.  That was it: I brought him to the vet and they told me it was hard to tell because he's a rescue and their medical histories are difficult to conclude - so, it could either just be the change of weather from summer to fall or it could be his food or it could be that he is just stressed out from shifting environments and owners.  I switched his food anyways, because I was tired of the fur and felt sorry for him, even though he loved the taste of Canidae.  Within a week, the shedding stopped and he stopped scratching.<br /><br />I dug up some reviews online about Canidae and the opinions seem pretty mixed.  Either people's dogs love it and do incredibly well on it or it causes extreme negative reactions, anything from nausea and vomiting to allergies, which is ironic considering it is grain-free.  After all the digging, I personally conclude that it is because Canidae changes their formula periodically and their quality, although rated highly in terms of their ingredients, is inconsistent because of their processing methods: as in, nobody seems to be quite sure where they process their ingredients and when they do change their formula, whether this change affects that process.<br /><br />Its such a shame because it is a bang for your buck and my dog loved the taste of it.  I just wish Canidae would be more transparent about their process and maybe tell their consumers why there are such polarized reactions by dogs when they consume this food.  Overall, it was definitely a learning experience.  For me, the food rates at 2 (not a 1, because the price is great for the quality of ingredients) since my particular dog's reaction was negative."
2,"Due to the rave reviews here, I ordered this tea.  Now I wonder what quality of teas these reviewers have been drinking.  Many of the opinions seem inflated.<br /><br />My report is that for the super reasonable price of this four-box package, you get a bland, undistinguished, OK green tea.  Because I drink a lot of green tea, I'll be periodically opting for Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea, so I can make my other tastier (more expensive) organic selections last longer.  For those purposes, the tea is fine.<br /><br />There's nothing abjectly wrong with this tea, but there's nothing special about it, either. Its biggest asset is that it's organic and very low-priced.  If that's what you're looking for, you'll be satisfied."
2,"My dog figured this out really fast and likes it a lot. However, it's over priced since my dog can get to the treats fast and he's a fast eater. I would suggest investing in a treat ball instead. That'll keep there attention longer and they are similarly priced."
2,"I prefer my hazelnut with a richer, fuller taster, which Gloria Jean's did not seem to have at all."
2,"I have tried various brands of Palak Paneer. Kitchens of India Palak Paneer tastes good. If you are health conscious like me, this one is not for you. This one seems to be soaked in too much oil."
2,"These things are horrible. I love the brand and the exceptional gluten-free products they provided. However, this cereal does not even taste like chicken. I had to add a sweetener to the milk to eat it."
2,"I had high expectation of this tea after reading the review and was willing to pay a bit more for it.  It has almost no jasmine flavor to it and lacks the aroma I was hoping for. I'm drinking it because I paid so much for it, but Numi's Jasmine Monkey King is way better and I can get it much cheaper at a grocery store, so I'll be trying their pearls instead of ever buying this weak tea again."
2,"I love hot cider, however this one didn't taste great to me. The artifical sweeteners spoils the taste. When it brews the caramel apple scent is just wonderful, and makes you want to try it, but I think it would taste much better if no sweetener was added and you could sweeten it to your taste."
2,"I purchased this tea along with several other kcup varieties for a coffee maker that gets occasional use.  Unfortunatley, the expiration date on the Celestial Green Decaf Tea purchased here on Amazon is within one month.  I know I will be throwing away most of this tea because it will expire before it is used.  All the other kcups purchased have at least one year before they expire.<br /><br />The shipping to return the tea would have cost half the price of the tea.  I don't think I will purchase any more food items on Amazon."
2,"I have to agree with the first reviewer on this. While I'm generally not a fan of fruity or floral teas, I love rose in tea. When I first opened the bag, I almost gagged at the overpowering aroma of citrus and florals - although tazo uses natural ingredients, it seemed almost synthetic. Luckily, the tea (unsweetened and brewed as suggested) does not taste nearly as strong as it smells. Still, I couldn't get past the fact that it smelled overwhelmingly like a funeral home / aunt gertrude's perfume while tasting like a bowl of froot loops.<br /><br />I suppose I had hoped for a more neutral base with subtle accents of flavor. If you don't mind in your face citrus and florals, then you will probably enjoy this tea."
2,"I was quite disappointed with the extremely short dating on the dry cat food product shipped.  It was bad enough to have to swallow the thought of paying that much for shipping, but to find a one month ""best by"" dating on an 8lb bag of dry cat food that I will only be feeding to one cat was rather irritating.  If my kitty wasn't so picky, and local pet store shelves continuing to have it on indefinite backorder I certainly would have optioned it.  Live and learn....always get specifics on food product dating.  Don't assume."
2,"Great idea - no calories, no fat, etc. They are slimey and chewing them is what I'd guess chewing worms would be like. They are firm enough to have more texture than pasta, but still gel like. I just put them with spaghetti sauce, but maybe there's a better option. Have not found it yet. I've read more about them and what nutritional benefits they may have so it makes it worth the try. Cost is certainly reasonable enough. Give them a try and maybe you'll have a better idea."
2,"I used to buy this products in groceries and pharmacies and I gave it to my mother and she used to fall asleep minutes later and after I gave to her for a couple of days on a row she used to sleep a lot during the day too (she suffers from insomnia). It is very difficult to find it in the stores now (the one with valerian) that is why I bought it from amazon, but I do not what happened but this one doesn't have the same effect on my mother, she still doesn't sleep and I have to give her the sleeping pills (they do not help that much either)."
2,"They may have great products, but shipping is incredibly slow (shipped 12 days after I placed the order; not yet received) and the shipping price is unreasonable."
2,"I have been going through a lot of different cappuccino mixes; and this one has to be one of the worse. It doesn't taste much like chocolate mocha."
2,"Today I received my package and was excited to try out the new peanut butter, as I had previous ordered a different flavor from Peanut Butter & Co. (The dark chocolate variety, and it was delicious!) through amazon a few months ago.  However I was extremely disappointed in this batch.<br /><br />When I first looked at the jars there were quite a lot of raisins on the bottom of the jars, which was not a problem.. I thought perhaps there was just a great deal of raisins in them!  However upon opening the first jar, I was quite wrong.  It seems that all the raisins had settled to the bottom, making me dig through the entire jar to the very bottom where they had all settled and smashed.<br /><br />Though I would have expected better mixing from a premium product like this, it was not the worst part.  Once I decided to try the peanut butter itself it had a VERY gritty texture, so bad that I had to spit it out afterward.  It was like a mouth full of peanut butter flavored sand.  Every bite was like chewing on a mouth full of sugar crystals.  All of the jars seemed to have the problem with the raisins being settled to the bottom, however I did not take a taste from each of them as well.<br /><br />I would have given one star, but Amazon was very quick and easy in resolving the matter for me, so they get an extra one for that!  I can only assume this was a defective batch, as the other ratings seem to be quite high... but it is a possibility you may received a bad order."
2,"How can you claim that this item is gluten-free when one of the ingredients is Barley Malt Extract. Barley is one of the key gluten ingredients along with wheat, rye and contaminated oats?"
2,"Half of the bag was all inside the mailing box due to poor packaging. The product itself is good though."
2,"i think these peppercorns are bland, tasteless, it lacks the pepper spiciness, will never buy this brand again.It was a fail choice to say the least"
2,"You gave me a package that was already opened with one bar missing.  NOT cool.  If this happens again, I am not ordering from you anymore."
2,"I am sure the product will be GREAT.<br />However, i will not buy from this vendor again.<br />I contacted them 30 minutes after the purchase in regards to shipping and they ignored me. The next email i received was after the product had shipped."
2,"The ghost peppers are the 5 or 6th ingredent in the salsa.This really dulls down the intense power of the pepper. Don't get me wrong it has alittle kick to it but I wanted more of the full effect of the ghost peppers."
2,"I am disapointed in these.  I thought they would be more like the Sunbeam/Sunshine Brand my Grandma used to buy but they don't compare at all."
2,"I have used this flavor - pea and duck for quite some time but the last 5 bags I have purchased smells HORRIBLE. I'm very disappointed and hope the manufacturer fixes the problem."
2,"My rating does not reflect this product at all.  I give the product a ""10"".  They are delicious and addicting.  :)  I give the product a low rating due to the seller's price for the product.  I hope people are not actually paying this price.  You can find this same brand in a 32 oz (2-lb) bag at most Costco's for $9.55.  If your Costco does not carry them or your store does not carry them, you can politely ask and your store will likely start.  I was appalled to see this seller has these for such a high price.  I love this product and Amazon, but I will make of note of the seller and never purchase from them.<br /><br />After further review I see Brookside is actually selling this product on Amazon for more than stores charge for the very same product.  I expect more out of a company then to try to swindle their consumers with excessive prices.  I understand the whole concept of saving by buying in bulk, but 100% markup to the direct public seems extreme."
2,"In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a ""real"" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than ""real"" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to ""real"" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists."
2,"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."
2,"The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again."
2,"I was suprised and disappointed at how salty the bacon was. It would have been good had it not been so salty.  I guess it can be used as a seasoning for greens or something but definitely not for breakfast"
2,"After you get past the weird smell and try some its not too bad. Just not going to be what you thought it was. And my biggest problem was prices of candy from online vendors. Wow. I only tried because my sister and I were talking about the old days. Hey, now I know."
2,"Beans were way too dry after cooking and had very little flavor. Too bad, I love the squirrel on the package :) I prefer Eden for day beans."
2,"this taffy was not good it was not hot at all the cinnamon tate was not good at all. the cost was too high. thay shoud have some one make some good cinnamon sugar free taffy out there."
2,"To expensive, I don't know what I was thinking. My cats didn't seem to excited about the food either."
2,"I have been drinking Earl Grey for a little over a year. Have tried several brands and this was not the best. I'm thinking it would be good for novelty drinkers...and don't let this avert you from the Tazo brand because they have several other flavors I highly enjoy...just not the Earl Grey."
2,"I decided to give these a try.  The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing!"
2,"I bought these without first doing some research. I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews."
2,"If it weren't way too sweet, it might be good - not excellent, but a good change of pace.  If you are looking for a strong chocolate taste, this isn't it."
2,"The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."
2,"I loved this trail mix, but the nuts in all the bags were spoiled (I assume because of Amazon storage?).  Really disappointing because I'd love to order this product again at this price."
2,"Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues."
2,"I read all the reviews of this product and couldn't wait to use it. I took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy. The doctor determined she had colic, changed my diet, added special formula - still was not producing enough breast milk, and took me off all vitamins. After a week, she was becoming our happy baby again. I started taking this product again and within three days she started screaming again. I immediately stopped taking this and within a few days she was back to normal. For some reason this product bothered her stomach. I did not read anything about this in any of the reviews and want to let people know this could happen to them as well."
2,"I would have given this a 5-star review in the past but my last shipment (October 2010) was extremely weak and didn't taste anything like it used to.  The k-cups didn't seem to have very much coffee in them.  They seemed very light when shaken as compared with the past.  I would also like to note that I have noticed this same problem on quite a few of the k-cups.  Also, they all taste very similar and not a good taste.  I had read that Green Mountain may have taken over some of the k-cup business for Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and maybe they have changed something.  For now, I will buy from BBB when they have a coupon and I can check the freshness code on the package.<br /><br />But, really I have gone back to using a french press which really doesn't take that long to make and has superior flavor."
2,"This stuff makes your water taste somewhat like KoolAid, but I wouldn't consider giving it to kids.  We need to eat and drink more natural foods, not stuff like this."
2,"The Swiss chocolate was very good and my kids loved them however I didn't realize until after my wife purchased this item just how expensive it was per kcup! If you are looking for an occasional cup of hot choc for yourself this is fine but not for carnivourous kids."
2,"This product is not bold in flavor at all. The package is different than what was pictured on the website. I called and was sent a new box but it arrived same. When I returned the product I did not get a refund. The product I ordered did not say it was a light roast."
2,"The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.  This ""Chili Chipotle Powder"" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.<br /><br />The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!<br /><br />Stick with a plain old generic ""chili powder"" instead of this."
2,"Not too bad in taste but haven't found the right cake to put it on.  It's really hard to find GF products that are easy and taste good."
2,"I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond ""Roasted Almonds - Honey"" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW"">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very ""off"" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."
2,"I've had some really tasty, sharp-flavored ginger black tea in the past -- you know, the kind that is so spicy it makes your nose run -- but this isn't it.  It tastes like a generic mild chai, and in spite of the picture of a big ginger root on the box, the fine print says it contains only imitation ginger flavor.  Bah!"
2,"After waiting over a year for La Victoria Fire Roasted Chilies to be offered again on Amazon, and not being able to find them in any local market, I ordered the Chi-chi's.  Although I realize that they are not Fire Roasted, I figured that they would be a suitable substitute.  Wrong there.  After Googleing for La Victoria, I found them at MexGrocer.com and ordered a bunch.  The price was higher than offered at Amazon, when Amazon had them, but they are worth the extra price."
2,"Wow, wasn't expecting this! The noodles and rice products were like slippery little worms and fish eggs respectively. The only product I related it to is the noodles used in a Hawaiian soup called ""Long Noodle"". They were slippery and unmanageable like the noodles in this pack. Now I used to eat that soup quite often so my appetite is much more expansive than my wife who needs this product for diabetic alternatives. She gave them away immediately!"
2,"The plants arrived well packed and on time.<br />It was planted in a patio Pot with drip line and starter Miracle  Grow pellet.<br />Within a few days the healthy leaves turned bkack and dropped off leaving the center pod to grow.<br />Within a week the leaves there turned black and now have dropped off also looking like one sick plant.<br />I took lots of photos over these days.  Finally I replanted it in the soil near another Banana tree, with a drip line.<br />I have done all I could do and it looks like a loser.  It has not been in direct sun and we have not had a 100+ day.<br />Maybe they will exchange for another Banana?<br />Yuma, AZ."
2,"My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my ""stomach of steel"" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be."
2,"it is definitely Coffee with Caffeine.. Taste like vanilla mixed with coffee but not as strong as vanilla syrup or anything..<br /><br />I honestly don't like this coffee, which is personal taste.<br /><br />the coffee is well ground, and the smell of it brewing is very nice, but not the taste of it!"
2,"HAVE ORDERED THIS BRFORE AND THIS TIME JUST DOESNT SEEM AS FRESH. WHEN I OPENED , THE CONTENTS SEEMED STALE, BUT THE DATE ON THE PACKAGE WAS OCT2013.....COULD HAVE BEEN A PIN HOLE IN BAG AND I COULDN'T FIND IT."
2,"This coffee is not a true medium roast like Caribou French Roast, Donut House, etc. there was not much coffee flavor at all. I found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did I have to go down a brew size, but I also have to add less milk just too drink it. I will never buy it again. Wish I didn't have 45 more cups to go thru!"
2,"I would give this item 5 stars if they were made a little thicker. Most bowls were broken when delivered and were useless, and you had to handle the ones that were not broken with extreme care."
2,"I usually like granola and chocolate, but this product was not for me.  The granola was too sweet and the appearance was not very appetizing.  I tried it several different times of the day, even as a cereal in the mroning, but it never did have a good taste and texture.<br /><br />I would not purchase this item."
2,"First, these bags are 1.5 servings, so adjust the calories accordingly. They tasted a bit greasy and the flavor was bearable."
2,"Imagine yourself craving coffee. But you're on... a big ferry boat. With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy. So you aren't stuck with 23 k-cups that make you cringe :)"
2,"I guess you can say i purchased this for the container, because in the end this is too expensive.  In 7-11 these are 99 cents each, here I had to pay $1.29 each.  So just get this to get the container and purchase it @ your nearest 7-11"
2,"Original review:  I must be a freak because I really like this granola, and can't stand some of the other gluten-free granolas that get much better ratings here on Amazon.  I don't know why I like it, but even though the berry flavor tastes a bit artificial, I like its tangy semi-sweetness a lot better than the awful ""maple"" and ""apple cinnamon"" ones that I've tried.  I think those taste even more fake, and much too sweet.  I guess I am not a fan of eating a lot of sugar on my cereal, and this one tastes less sweet than some of the others.  I guess it's really a matter of personal taste.  I'm going against the crowd on this one... I just ordered a 6-pack.<br /><br />Oct. 5 2010<br />I have to change my review.  I ordered six of these, but what I received is NOT the same product that I've been buying in my local grocery store.  Either they've changed it to make it worse, or Amazon is selling old stock and the one in the grocery store is the ""improved"" version.  Plus I got heartburn big time from this one, and never had it before from the grocery store item.  I didn't like it at all... am donating the remaining 5 packages to a homeless shelter or a gluten intolerant friend.  Two stars now."
2,"I received the order promptly and several of the eyes were broken.  They were very hard and brittle.  The taste of the gum was OK but it was plain to see that these were very old.  I would not purchase again."
2,"These cookies are a little strange. They are a bit chewy. They are a little dry. But the grains do appear to be healthy and much better than other cookies. They need to be bigger / MORE and cost less. There is only 8 small ones in the box and most of the box is packaging. Which makes it look like there could be more, but isn't. I hate it when manufactures do this, its the old ""packaging con."" They should be taxed for excessive use of packaging, especially plastic.. erhmmm erhmmm.. Cos*co. Each of the cookies is a bit small, some in the box are smaller than others. You could easily eat 3-4, then that would be almost half the box consuming more than a dollar. I would give then 4/5 stars if they put 16-20 in a box for the same price, and I bet the same size (volume) box would be possible too!"
2,"I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective. If I was a Maxwell House drinker I might say this coffee was great. If on the other hand, I roasted my own beans (I do), I would say this coffee is disappointing. I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the ""My K cup"" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang."
2,"I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though."
2,"The packaging does not match what is show on the website.  The teabags came in a box suited to hold metal screws not teabags.  The teabags were tossed in there like screws as well.  So, unless you plan to store your teabags in your garage at your workbench, do not order these.  I ordered these as a subscription which I am now cancelling."
2,"BEANS NOT PROPERLY PREPARED. TO MANY STRINGS IN THEM. IT IS ON THE BACK OF THE BEAN MUST BE REMOVED."
2,"i order these for my baby shower and unfortunately  i had to buy it again from another store because out of 80 sticks only 23 came out nice and unbroken. had to pay double the price it sucks.!! never again."
2,"I bought this to replace a large container of Schilling red pepper flakes that I bought about a long time ago. The old stuff served me well for cooking and pizza topping over the last decade. When I first tasted the new stuff I was a little disappointed that it was not as hot as the Schilling had been. It also seems to be losing its heat quickly -- there's less heat there than there was when I got it a few months ago."
2,"I purchased this based on reviews here on Amazon. Big Mistake!!! As soon as I received my shipment I went online to the Pamela's Products website and printed out recipes. So far I have tried 3 recipes and none of them have turned out even close to what they were supposed to be! I followed them to the letter and nada!<br /><br />First recipe was ""Cut Biscuits"". Turns out that their recipe for ""Drop Biscuits"" and ""Cut Biscuits"" is exactly the same and very runny. I decided to make ""Drop Biscuits"" instead because the batter was so runny and they didn't even rise. All I ended up with was some hard lumps on a cookie sheet that were dry.<br /><br />Next I printed the ""No Yeast By Hand Bread Loaf Recipe"". That didn't rise either and it came out the consistency of cornbread not like any kind of bread that you could actually make a grilled sandwich with or toast as the website claims.<br /><br />Ever the glutton for punishment, I decided to try the ""Bread Machine With Yeast Recipe"" from the website. I tried it twice on two different settings. First I tried the ""One Rise Rapid Cycle"" for gluten free bread and then I tried the ""Normal Cycle"" for white bread as the website says and they both ""fell"" (collapsed in the middle) shortly after the baking cycle started!!!<br /><br />I have now wasted money, eggs, olive oil, several yeast packets, time etc. and all I have to show for it is 4 1/2 bags of useless flour that isn't working with the recipes provided by the company that made it and I don't know how to use it for anything else. I had previously purchased products from ""Gluten Free Pantry"" and I never had any problems with their products.<br /><br />I only purchased this because of the reviews and because I could get it in bulk on Amazon for a better price. I will certainly be canceling my subscription for this product. Lesson learned, knowledge acquired...<br /><br />***Addendum: I decided to request a call from Amazon to let them know that the product may be defective because it was not performing correctly and to my surprise they offered me a full refund!!! I wasn't expecting that! And to think that I nearly decided to just let it go and chalk it up to experience. Thank God and Cheers to Amazon!!!"
2,"This tea are very weak.Please save your money.Far as weight loss i have lost 3 pounds,but i don't know if it's because of the tea.I've been working out for the past 2 weeks."
2,"Haribo makes a wide range of candies, including some world class goodies, but this is not one of them. The frogs are made of a hard gummi, and are all green except for a thin white layer on the frogs' bellies. You might not recognize them as frogs unless you're told. There is no discernible taste or texture difference between the white and green substances, and in any case, the flavor is unidentified, unidentifiable, and not very good. It definitely is not lime, as advertised. Maybe somebody likes this stuff, but I didn't. I set the bag out at the office after my first sample."
2,"First the good news: These groats have great flavor -- rich, nutty, slightly fruity, and just a little sweet. For many years, I have been eating steel cut oats, mostly from Honeyville Farms. (See: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZN4XY"">Steel Cut Oats CAN, 4.38 lb.</a>.) Steel cut oats are so much better than smashed oatmeal and groats are even better. I don't know if these groats are a different variety of oats or if it's just that they are whole groats, but the flavor is distinctly different from the steel cut. I love the steel cut, so this is not to denigrate them, but these groats have a much more complex flavor that I really like.<br /><br />The bad news, which I hope only pertains to this supplier, is the number of husks. Sometimes it's only 1-2/bowl. Sometimes it 1-2 in every spoonful. There is also something gritty from time to time. This really detracts from enjoying the rich, nutty flavor.<br /><br />Groats require a lot more cooking than steel cut and they absorb at least twice as much water. My cooking method for steel cut is to bring them to a boil in a 2:1 water:oats mixture and then leave in the frig overnight. That barely gets is started with groats.<br /><br />So far, the best method I have found is to simmer them in a 4:1 (water:groats) mixture for about 30-45 minutes or until almost all of the water is absorbed or gone. I use the microwave with 1/2 to 3/4 cup groats and 4x the water. I bring it to a boil and then simmer on low power. I usually set it for 30 minutes and then check. When almost all of the water is gone, I put them in the frig overnight (covered). Sometimes they are too dry the next day. I'm still experimenting with the details. I like the microwave because I don't have to be right there to make sure it doesn't go dry and burn. And if it sits a little while, that just continues the softening process.<br /><br />I tried cooking them in my rice cooker (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G30ESY"">Zojirushi NS-LAC05 Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel</a>). I used one scoop of groats (~3/4 cup) and, based on the results above, filled the pan to the 2-scoop level (double the amount of water). I set it to be ready at 8:30 the next morning. When I woke up, the house had a nice aroma of something cooking. It was a little like when I cook rice and a little like peanuts. Pleasant. When I opened the rice cooker, I found that the groats had expanded more than with the other methods. I added milk (half and half) and raisins and reheated in the microwave. The oatmeal was just about perfect. The groats had expanded to at least 2-3 times original size and were tender and soft, but still much more chewy than the steel cut. The yield was about 1.5-2.0 cups. Absolutely delicious, very filling, and completely different from steel cut oats.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. This really messed up the rice cooker. It cooked overnight, so I was not there so watch it, but I imagine that it bubbled up through the steam vent in the top. There was dried (cooked on) oat residue on the roof of the cooker and all inside the lid. I had to take it apart to clean it - about an hour. Do NOT try this at home. ;-)<br /><br />I imagine a slow cooker would work better, but I don't have one to try.<br /><br />I also want to try Moon Glough's suggestion of toasting them first.<br /><br />I also tried putting them in the food processor just to compare that with the steel cut. I tried several times with varying amounts of processing from just barely to almost a powder. They all came out like mush and tasted bland. It's a puzzle to me why the taste should be so much different.<br /><br />I love the taste, but am rating this product only 2 stars because of the husks and grit. It takes away too much of the enjoyment and it is not attractive if you are not eating alone. I'm going to try groats from other suppliers, including Honeyville farms. I hope someone has better quality control."
2,"Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices."
2,"Tried this sauce recently and it wasn't bad, per se, but had very flavor at all and none of the spicy bite I was looking for."
2,"These are great cookies and moist enough to feel like something other than a typical dry cookie.  They have a great mild ginger flavor nicely put together with the dates.  My only wish is that they would make it without sugar.  It's the only reason why I gave it a low rating and the only reason I won't reorder them."
2,"My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes sour. The taste of tomato is too strong. Tomato has lycopene, a antioxidant for good health, but my son just won't eat. He like other happy baby productx like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either."
2,"I've had the regular coconut water so I thought I'd try this out.  Something is off with the flavor and not in a good way.  It doesnt really taste tropical nor coconut.  Its actually pretty disgusting.  I'd stick with just the regular coconut flavor."
2,"Is this cake mix REALLY $32.28?or $3.28?I dont think any cake mix is so great that people would want to buy it for $32 + shipping.WOW."
2,"I like most of this company's line a lot. But this one has some problems. The first reviewer talked about there being little chocolate. Well, I found plenty of chocolate, but it wasn't very good. Poor texture and a sort of waxt taste. More important, there's something in it that feels like large grit. I can only imagine that it's the pears, cut a bit close to the core. I haven't picked it apart to see what it is, because I don't much care, and it puts me off of buying any more. (That's with milk.) So, not their best effort, I'm afraid. Somehow, I don't think it's going to be much of a success. The indulgence of chocolate sure doesn't go with the gritty texture of what else is in there. Probably the #5 is a better alternative if you want chocolate."
2,"I tried the Frooties mBerry and the effect lasted one hour for me. I purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price.<br /><br />This version lasted only ten minutes. I tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch. The results from each test was the same.<br /><br />I would not suggest this version of the product, other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries."
2,"I just received these refills and opened the box to find that they are stale. I've purchased these in the past from a pet store and they've always been firm, but still chewy. The ones I received from this order are dry and most have cracked into pieces. They are not out of date and the packaging was intact (as far as I could tell), but they are definitely unusable. I gave this 2 stars because my experiences with this product when purchased at the pet store have been okay."
2,"Well, it attracts moths well, as indicated by the ""powder"" marks on the tape.  On the other hand, it has yet to trap even one of them.  I think I can hear them laughing at me right now."
2,"I don't really know what to make of these treats.  I was first drawn to them because of the claim they were for both cats and dogs and since it is something of an extra special treat it's nice to have something the whole family can enjoy.  But I was not impressed on any level.  Lets be honest, we all by these over priced pet treats for ourselves and not the pets.  If you honestly wanted to make your pet ecstatic you would go to the butcher shop, get tub of chicken livers or giblets, cook them up and have very happy pets.  For me this product is outrageously expensive, has an offensive smell and a texture of sawdust.<br /><br />The makers are trying to draw you in with this idea of it being ""Raw"" but do you want to feed a pet, or better yet even handle a product where the main ingredient is chicken if it actually is raw?  Though it doesn't say so on the package I don't think this item is actually freeze dried raw meat, but instead is supposed to appeal to the human's desire to feed their pet something that's healthy, i.e. raw diet for dogs.  But I see nothing in this item to make it any healthier than many other pet treats that are much cheaper in price.  I was also a little shocked at some of the health claims made on the package too.  Apparently, ""Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidents of ear infections and healthier teeth & gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experienced.""  I have to call B.S. on that claim.<br /><br />The only real positive thing I can say about this product is that on one cat loved it.  My dog and other cat ate it, but weren't crazy about it.<br /><br />2 stars."
2,"We usually cook our own dry beans, but sometimes you need something quick.  So, I always keep a few cans of beans on hand. We usually buy Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Brand Beans at our local Co-Op, but I bought a can of this to try since it was on sale.<br /><br />The first impression was not great, but then odd bitter aftertaste and an earthy ""dirt"" sort of taste made us pause.  And then the texture - it was all wrong- there was something other than beans in our can, like roots or something... it was gross enough that I could only eat a few bites of mine.  My husband stopped at bite one. What a waste of money!<br /><br />I wanted to give this one star - but my husband said to give the company the benefit of the doubt - maybe not all cans are as bad as the one we bought. Either way, I'm not buying their beans again!"
2,"These crackers taste absolutely delicious, but leave a coating/aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for a long time.  Also, they contain MSG and for some people (I'm one of them) it causes a headache.  The last time I binged on these crackers (and they are hard to put down!), I ended up with a crashing headache.  Be forewarned!"
2,"I had high hopes this could be a money-saving alternative, but the quality just isn't there.  Put me down for ""eh."""
2,"My initial review of this product was glowing, but continuing to use it I have found the product quality to be most inconsistent:  Sometimes the coffee is great then the next cup will be like dishwater.  I'm an analyst by profession but I cannot figure this one out.  Until Melitta can correct the inconsistency in this product, I will not purchase it again.  I'm cancelling my subscription.  Original review:  Recently I have been very disappointed with my Senseo coffee pods which I have been buying for several years. The flavor had become so weakened that I was adding other instant coffee to it to try to produce a robust cup of coffee.  I had even considered replacing my coffee maker. When the Senseo pods were no longer available, I decided, reluctantly, to try these Melita pods as they were more reasonably priced than the other alternatives.  What a pleasant surprise!!  Here's my robust coffee back again!! These pods definitely have more coffee in them because, when I discard them, they are noticeably heavier than were the Senseo pods.  Also, I had to use the larger pod holder that came with my machine because, when wet, the smaller holder would not contain the coffee while brewing.  Another pleasant surprise... these pods are individually wrapped and come in a dispenser box!  Try the subscription (you can select your own delivery interval) and save about $1 per box and get free shipping!  Thank you, Melita and please don't change this product in any way or you will be hearing from me for sure."
2,"I saw this kind bar on amazon and bought it to try. I had high expectations that were dashed the minute I tasted the first bite. The mixture of the mango and macadamia do not go well together. I was very disappointed."
2,"When my son and I were diagnosed with Celiac's Disease, I was on the hunt for a bread mix that would make good bagels. I finally found it with Pamela's baking mix. Always enjoying the texture and taste up until January 2011. When I baked up some bagels with the new batch something changed in their mix...and I just couldn't quite figure it out. The color was lighter and the bagels would no longer rise as they used to. The smell was nauseating while it baked and left me with a bad aftertaste and sour stomach. The texture was not chewy and the bagels did not have that beautiful golden brown color to them anymore. I was so disappointed and upset that they changed their mix which was Amazing just the way it was!  The company may receive their flour from another manufacture or they may have changed flour ratio. Whatever they have done, PLEASE change the flour back to the way it used to be! You have lost a dedicated customer! Such a Shame! =("
2,"Pretty sure this stuff is giving all six of my foster kittens diarrhea, which neither their dry kibble (Blue Buffalo Wilderness Kitten) nor their alternative wet food (Fancy Feast Classic grain-free varieties) do. I don't think they absorb much in the way of nutrition when the food shoots right through them, and of course it's a messy experience for me. Not a fan of this product."
2,"Well, I thought it would be a great dog food, but my dogs don't like it at all.<br />I will go back to feeding Diamond Naturals--it's just as good quality, but at a cheaper<br />price, and my dogs love that food."
2,"As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again."
2,"These gummy bears are very chewey.  They seem like they are stale, like old candy gets, but the sell by date is still good.  They are okay except they are very chewey."
2,"Chef Boyardee must have cheated his way through culinary school, 'cuz this stuff rots! There were very few meatballs...the sauce was way to acidic...and the pasta was quite mushy. Check out Campbell's spaghettios with meatballs if you need a fix."
2,"If you like a hot, hard chew with little taste, try these.  I didn't enjoy them."
2,"This stuff is glorified mustard, there are better products of this type on the market. G King, Troy, AL"
2,"I drink a lot of coffee.  I drink lattes, cappuccinos, espressos, you name it.  I have tried other packaged coffee drinks before (i.e. Starbucks Frappuccinos and Caribou Coffee) and have always found them to be very sweet, but this one from illy issimo, I thought, was very bitter.  On the outside of the can it does state that cream and sugar are included, but I could not taste it.  The only reason I am not giving this one out of five stars is because this is solely based on my personal taste, and there might be others out there that like a much stronger taste, and would like something like this.  I also liked the packaging, as I brought this to work with me for a mid-day boost and found it easy to throw into my lunch bag."
2,"May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]"
2,"After reading several reviews from people apparently on diets I now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good. These are bland, have a weird texture and aren't very good. I will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away. I ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry. They are low in calories and low in taste. Pass."
2,"The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product."
2,"The Coffee Shop pod in this pack is replaced with the Coffee House pod by Green Mountain, even though the Coffee Shop pods are described and pictured.  Customer Service was less than helpful when contacted and sent a response e-mail that lectured me.  Be cautious when shopping this seller."
2,"My dog was pretty confused when I put this in his face. Whenever I do he'll lick it once or twice then step back and look at me like, ""Can I have a real treat now?"" At least he doesn't hate it, but he sure doesn't get excited about this whenever I pull it out.<br /><br />But don't go off my review alone, other dogs seem to like it. Just not my poodle."
2,"nothing about this jerky stands out.  might as well buy a pack at the gas station rather than have a 4 pack of this."
2,"This is a strange tasting tea; it smells stinky and taste like dried autumn leaves from the yard. It may be good for you, but at a price. I decided to mix this stuff with a breakfast tea to make it palatable."
2,"I did not care for this coffee. The first thing I noticed when I opened it is that it smells bad and I'm the kind of person that likes the smell of coffee. Anyway, despite the unpleasant aroma I brewed a cup to try it. I didn't really like the flavor, even after I added a bunch of creamer and sugar (which usually makes most coffees okay). I wouldn't say it was horrible, but I will be going back to my old stuff."
2,"I was taken by the raving reviews of this product. Seven reviews and all seven rated the product with 5 stars. I thought this was amazing, so I bought the product and I have to wonder if the products producer didn't provide these ratings.<br />I love green tea, but this is too much. If the floral was subdued it might be real nice, but this bold floral taste makes me feel like I'm drinking Mom's favorite perfume, or gargling with aftershave to cover-up bad breath.<br />I don't know if I can develop a taste for this, but I almost have to, since I have 99 more cups to drink!"
2,"Bad tasting coffee, no aroma/baked, very dry, bitter, hard, harsh and unpleasant aftertaste of burnt charcoal. Not suitable for espresso and not creamy at all."
2,"Seeds are nice and tasty... However, shipping almost doubles the price.  Found a local organic seller of seeds and the price is much better."
2,"The peach flavor, compared to many others, just doesn't do it for me. . .Everybody has their own tastes and this one just didn't work.  Like/love most of the others!"
2,"As a mother of 7, I am always looking for healthy alternatives to sodas, Kool-aid, and energy drinks my kids seem to pine for. The fact that this is not a powder (which can be really messy for a child to use) and contains a respectable number of vitamins made me excited to try it.<br /><br />The squeeze bottle is just the right size for even small hands. Also, the liquid mixes instantly in water so a spoon isn't even needed to stir! Less things to wash for me.<br /><br />All of my kids were eager to try it but sadly, the taste is so off that no one even finished their glass. That's saying a lot since my kids will drink stuff I don't even want to smell. 7 people tried it, including myself, and everyone described it the same way. The first swallow was OK, but it is immediately followed by a strong aftertaste that can only be described as ""medicine-like"". It is a seriously bad taste.<br /><br />Also, everyone needed 3 squirts for it to taste like anything except watered down cough syrup. But then, it just tasted like Kool-aid and cough syrup mixed together.<br /><br />I hope the manufacturers read these reviews and work on the flavor because if it tasted good, I'd buy it by the case. This is exactly the kind of product I've been looking for - if I could only ""swallow"" the awful taste."
2,"This 6-pack of jarred strained tomatoes took two weeks to arrive, even though I ordered by Prime, and two jars were broken.  The box was a complete mess.  Despite being extremely careful I still cut myself twice trying to extricate the unbroken bottles.  I called customer service, reached a phone tree in which I eventually heard the recording that I would have to email them, that they had requested, since broken glass was all over my floors and sink/disposal and labels were now unreadable.  They refunded me for the two jars, supposedly, haven't actually seen that yet.  The only good thing is they use jars for this particular product and not toxic plastic-lined cans, or plastic jars.  I will just have to drive the extra 20 minutes to Trader Joe's for their jarred tomatoes from now on. Taste of the sauce was fine, nothing spectacular."
2,"for a gourmet jam, I expected this to be less sweet and more fragrant. a teaspoon of this stuff is enough to sweeten 6oz of greek yogurt, and greek yogurt is the only kind of yogurt that can stand up to it. it's also alright on a waffle, assuming you skip the syrup. other than that I really don't know what to do with it, the sweetness is just so overpowering."
2,"The top on one of the bottles was loose. The agave leaked out and hardened inside the plastic wrap, leaving a mess and wasting several ounces of the agave."
2,"I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product). Every bar is 40g and there are 13g of sugar. Yikes. I wish I had looked this up before I purchased this because I have nine more bars. What's worse, instead of getting twelve bars, my box only came with ten. I will not be ordering this or any other Kind bars."
2,"My beloved cat, Lily, is 15 years old and is smaller than normal for her age - she weighs only 5 lbs. Still, she has the appetite of a lion.<br /><br />I bought this thinking it was perfect for an older cat, but this dry food has bigger pieces than what she's used to. She has trouble chewing it and so leaves a lot leftover in her bowl.<br /><br />Wasted my money. I feel mislead by the label. You would think the dry food would be made easier for an older cat to digest."
2,"It's a small bar of jelly, which is rose flavored, covered in milk chocolate. It's very soft and goes down easy. I don't think it's that great. Maybe if you don't have teeth."
2,"Although this is supposedly a blackberry vanilla tea, there is no vanilla in it according to the ingredients list. Instead, one presumes the vanilla flavor is listed as ""natural flavor."" You do know that the ""natural flavor"" which is often used to mimic real vanilla comes from the castor sacs of beavers, don't you? Yikes. According to wikipedia: ""In the United States, castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of mature beavers, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a food additive,often referenced simply as a ""natural flavoring"" in the product's list of ingredients. It is commonly used in both food and beverages, especially as vanilla and raspberry flavoring.""<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black currant pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin."
2,"Well on its own.. it doesn't taste BAD.. but wasn't flavorful on its own. I can see where it would work with a spinach dip or something like that. Doesn't taste bad.. just not enough to make me want to keep eating them or buy more."
2,"We'd been buying the four-pack of Melitta French Vanilla coffee once a month for the past 2 years. We won't be any more. In the last month they changed their packaging, which is fine, but also changed the grind. All of a sudden, these four packs come in ""extra fine grind,"" which simply doesn't work well at all in our drip coffee maker. The whole pot tastes weak until you get to the last couple of cups, which taste more like mud because all of the coffee has settled. Here's hoping they switch back at some point, because this is just bad."
2,"My biggest complaint with this flavor of Zatarain's is the amount of sodium it contains. The Nutrition Facts on the box says it has 980mg per serving, which is equivalent to a whopping 41% of the Percent Daily Values. That's PER SERVING, of about 5 servings per box. That's just way too much salt... by comparison, the regular Zatarain's Jambalaya Mix contains only about half the sodium. Even when I added more meat(I used chicken instead of ground beef as suggested), the dish still came out too salty. I finally decided that in order to make this mix more edible, I had to discard about one-third to one-half of the seasonings. The seasonings come all clumped together anyway so it wasn't difficult to separate it from the rice before cooking.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, I wasn't too impressed either. The seasoning is basically chicken bouillon cubes with some spices, like oregano and basil. Not terrible, but not terribly inventive either.<br /><br />So, with apologies to the three 5-star reviews that came before mine, I do not recommend this product. To each his own, I guess."
2,"I am not a tea drinker, so I let my wife try this product since she enjoys tea and has several varieties on hand at any given time.  She was eager to try this vanilla spice tea, since she had never had tea flavored in such a way.<br /><br />She had the tea as a mid-afternoon ""pick me up,"" intrigued by its package claim, ""energizes the body and focuses the mind.""  Her initial reaction was not enthusiastic.  In fact, she wasn't thrilled with the combination of vanilla and tea.  She looked at the package information and found that an 8-ounce cup of this tea contains only 10 mg. less caffeine than an equivalent cup of coffee, so the ""Naturally energizes without the jitters"" package claim is misleading.  The tea contains quite a bit of caffeine.<br /><br />She tried a second cup the next day, wanting to be sure to give it a fair evaluation.  The second cup confirmed her opinion.  Yogi's Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy tea is far less satisfying than peppermint tea, green tea, or orange spice tea, three of her favorites.  She would not be inclined to try this product again."
2,"It may have been just the one we had, but it tasted bitter. I'm hoping it was just that caviar and not that it was spoiled. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't worth it."
2,"As far as the drink is concerned, it's 5 stars.  I think it's the best sports drink on the market.  My review is strictly concerning the price.  You can buy the same exact thing (24 pack of 20 oz. bottles) at Sam's Club for $14.88 ($14.23 less/49% cheaper).  The only difference is that it is a variety pack that includes 8 Lemon Lime, 8 Fruit Punch and 8 Grape.  I think Lemon Lime is the best flavor but I'm not sure it's worth paying twice as much for it.  Amazon should cut their price significantly and be more competitive."
2,"The whole kit showed up as promised.  I made the recipes as instructed.  The bread was heavy like a rock, not fluffy like the Ezekial bread we buy in the store.  I discovered that to make that kind of bread, we would have to invest in a special grinding machine that costs over $200.  Well--me thinks we'll stick to buying it from the store."
2,"This salt is way overpriced. Go to your local store and buy Morton Sea Salt.<br />Saltygator"
2,"The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'."
2,"I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'."
2,"I didn't really enjoy this one. I tried the Hazelnut from a couple of different companies and this one was definitely not the best. After trying one, I regretted the fact that I bought so many. Not going to buy this one again."
2,"The first roll of bags was fine, but so far every bag on the second roll has been defective ... the bottoms tear open as soon as you put your hand into it, or (WORSE) tear open as soon as you put your doggy mess inside.  Gross!  I'm not real enthused about finding out if the rest of the rolls are defective or not ... I think I'll just cut my losses and pitch them into my recycle bin."
2,"I bought two boxes and they were sooooooo hard. Will not buy again. They didn't tell me they were about to expire..Ask first!"
2,"I guess everyone has to do their own trial and error to see what works for their little fur friends. After researching alot about the best thing for dogs to eat, Wellness is one of the brands that has my respect... but...<br />it makes our little BOM (beagle/pomeranian) & our rough coated jack russell mix<br /> THIRSTY, FARTY & WEEPY. (that sounds like a bad mix of creepy dwarf names)<br /><br />To be fair, THEY LIKE IT... This small breed kibble is happily gobbled,then they insist on drinking aLOT! and then they fart a little bit, too....and it makes my terrier's eyes weepy, too... with those icky rust stains, and she NEVER has had that problem.<br /><br />So, we are back to our other favorites, which is the rabbit kibble from Nature's Variety Instinct, and the frozen PawNaturaw beef medallions, and of course, their fav breakfast is<br />a Stella and Chewy's Dandy Lamb dehydrated steak. (those don't make the girls thirsty!)<br />These choices are a little closer to the raw diet which I prefer to feed when I can.<br /><br />So, sorry, Wellness, we tried ya! We will finish the bag, but won't be buying any more...<br />I figure we got about a week of dog farts to suffer through yet."
2,"I bought some of these things when i was out of town. And i like it so much i bought a bag. The bag i bought out of town had sesame seeds sugar and honey. But the bag i got had this version of it. Sesame seeds sugar honey and CORN SYRUP. Not what i was expecting. If anyone knows of a product is more natural then please let me know."
2,"I am a fan of gunpowder tea and have been for years. The flavor is about what I would expect from a gunpowder tea. The problem with this product is that the pellets were either broken or made up of leaf shreds instead of whole leaves and seem to lack the density I'm used to. Part of this may be that the packaging is a thin cardboard box and not a tin. I don't know if this is normal for the brand as it is my first purchase and probably my last. I'll try other new (to me) gunpowder tea marketers or go back to some of my tried and true brands."
2,"When I received this product I notice that the box was wet.  When I opened the box, I found that ten (10) of the Pop Ices had leaked.<br />There appears to be a good variety of flavors and since I only received them yesterday I have not tried any yet."
2,"I love all things Raspberry and Chocolate, but this did not do it for me. I don't like strong coffee and WOW is this strong. I only drank one cup out of a box of 48 k-cups."
2,"I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money."
2,"Suzie (my 3 year old Westie) loves fish, and especially salmon, so I thought she would go wild for these.  But surprisingly, she has no interest.  She tried one, but since then did not even want to eat them again.  They stink like crazy, which should be a further indication that she'd go for them, but...  sad to say....  no interest.  I am not sure why, the ingredient list looks great.... maybe its a fluke so I am not going to say this is a bad product.  But....."
2,"Too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods.  I'm trying to follow a low inflammation diet.  I do love the taste of goats milk.  It's very rich and creamy.  The liquid is better than the powder."
2,"Taste is not acceptable and shipping cost from overseas very high. Wife is English and says the present product is not the same as what it used to be."
2,"I really don't like this coffee.  It has a strange taste to it.  I'm used to adding creamer to my coffee and it just doesn't work.  Even without creamer the taste is BAD. It smells like vanilla when you brew it, but the flavor is medicinal.  I don't recommend it all."
2,"First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this ""roll-on"" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it."
2,"""How can something with sugar as the second ingredient be so incredibly bitter?"" said my husband after his first taste. I couldn't answer, my mouth was puckered like an old lady at a lemon eating contest.<br /><br />Hubby reached for the Hazelnut creamer, poured a little in, and we both agreed it made a huge improvement.<br /><br />I realize there are plenty of manly men out there who like their coffee black and their women strong, or something like that, but no one in our family resembles that description. However, for people who like cold black coffee, this is probably a very refreshing drink. For a generation brought up on super-sweet flavored and whip-cream-topped coffee concoctions, I doubt this will be a hit. Unless they use it as a challenge, like eating a teaspoon of cinnamon, or drinking Sriracha sauce straight from the bottle."
2,"This coconut water isn't very tasty.  It says tropical fruit but it only tastes like guava.  There's no taste of any of the other fruit. This was my first time trying coconut water.  I know people who rave about it and I thought I could do several things with tropical fruit, but it's pretty much been a waste of money.  Only buy if you reeeally like the taste of guava."
2,"I'm not sure what the problem was with this product. I was extremely disappointed, contacted the company only to learn they had out-sourced their business. Bad move......................"
2,"I bought these at the grocery and was pretty pumped... organic juice boxes! Sweet. Well, not really. They are pretty watered down. After slurping on one, I flipped the grape over - 10% juice. Water and cane sugar top the list of ingredients. Pretty tasteless and I feel like a bit of a sham. I can flavor my glass of water with a spritz of grape or berry. (Beware the Berry Berry Lemonade flavor is 5% juice). I will go back to Apple and Eve (60% fruit and veggie juice) or Juicy Juice (100%, though possibly from China) until I find a better organic juice box."
2,"I bought these based on a magazine recommendation but you know, the brownies are just so-so.  Won't buy again."
2,"I bought these for my almost 9 month old twins. I was totally shocked by how hard these wagon wheels were. I bought them thinking they would be like there other products, soft and safe to eat. While I can break them up into little pieces to eat that defeats the purpose I could just give Cheerios for a fraction of the price. I have to say i dont feel comfortable giving them a whole one to eat, they put in there months and they take forever to dissolve. Big miss on Gerbers part for these items."
2,"This worked fine for the idea, but I found it to be way too small to use for very much food. If I even wanted to chop up a sweet potato I ran out of room on the board. So, I would say it is not worth the money at all!"
2,"This was okay,not even hot, tasted kinda like it was old.i was really bummed out. i had high hopes , even though,i ate it anyhow.although the free sample was top shelf, finest of quality,fresh ,and definitely executive standard.to me,the habenero flavor was stale tasting,and not worth the money,honest."
2,"Well, the good news is, it does what it's supposed to, making yogurt thicken to the consistency we tend to like it.  The bad news is, it's not much more than just simply super expensive powdered milk.  I remember long ago when dry milk was a staple that was given out at food banks, etc., and was a super cheap commodity.  Now, it's hard to find and extremely costly, but at least you get a lot of it when you do buy a box of it.  This starter is teeny tiny and makes one batch, more than doubling the cost of the yogurt.  Next time around, I tried a little gelatin, and it worked exactly the same way."
2,"That's the only thing I could think of when eating this. The texture, the taste, the ""gravey"" that it comes in. It's just not that good. It's just not for me."
2,"I was hoping this product would be as tasty as the dill dip but it is far too salty.  I had to double up on the sour cream to tone down the saltiness."
2,"Dear Amazon,<br />I am a faithful customer for many, many years.  Last year, I placed the Numi teas on recurring order.  During the past 3 orders of receiving the Gunpowder Green Tea, I am receiving defective product.  This is not good.  The tea bags are not properly attached to the string, so they fall into the tea.  In addition, several of the packages I have received are smashed.  Am I receiving old tea as a result of getting it recurring?  Is this from a company that sells dated product?  I would like to continue receiving the green tea, but I don't want compromized product.<br />Can you order from a different seller for this tea?<br />Please advise."
2,"I was thinking that this Annie Chun's noodle bowl would be just as good as the others I've tried, but I was wrong. The sauce had an oily appearance and a horrible flavor."
2,"I've been trying to replicate the movie theater popcorn experience at home for a year now trying different oils, corn, and toppings.  I purchased this recently after I ran out of Paragon Coconut oil to pop with.  At first I thought it tasted pretty good.  After popping with it 5 times I have just recently purchased more Coconut oil to use for popping.  This product is canola oil, coloring, and butter flavor.  It imparts an almost artificial butter flavor to the popcorn versus coconut oil and the more you eat popcorn made with it the more you dislike it.  At least that's what happened to me.  The smell is odd and not very appealing out of the jug and doesn't change for the better when heated. If theaters are using canola oil in place of coconut oil now then this is not what they use.  I'd stick with Coconut oil since that is what makes popcorn the best."
2,"These bars may be made of ingredients you can pronouns, but they are not exactly good for you.  The contain high amounts of sugar and fats.  Not the kind of thing you can eat as a snack very often.  I like the taste, but I have found bars that are actually good for you, so I won't be buying these anymore.  Also, I find them way overpriced."
2,"I recently opened a new pack of the Celcius calorie burner Cola flavored and the drink tasted FLAT. I checked the expiration date and it was not expired. Very disappointed with product."
2,"what can I say!  Come home from the commissary, thinking I would get some cheese and enjoy these new crackers.  What a huge disappointment,  lacking flavor to which is different to me then what I came to expect from cheez its.  The lasting flavor in the back of my mouth is almost vinegar flavored.  Would not buys these again."
2,"2 of the 12 oz bags were slit open leaving the beans all over the amazon<br />box , not happy"
2,"Received product, which I purchased from Amazon.  Not a single cookie survived transit.  Nothing but crumbs.  Simply not worth getting from Amazon unless they do a better shipping job.  I would stay away from anything that is fragile at least in the sense of foods and groceries."
2,"I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work."
2,"I really wanted to like these.<br /><br />First off, these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and aren't that thick. And they are more like fudge that cookies. Look at the ingredients. They are nut flour held together with honey. They need some egg or something. They are gooey and sticky. They are extremely sweet and pack a whopping 10-15g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiber.<br /><br />I'm sorry I appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a novetly. They are too expensive and too non-functional to be a serious part of your regular diet."
2,"I could not find the ingredient list in the Amazon product description, so went to the Spectrum website.  For those of you looking for olive oil mayo due to concerns with soybean and canola oil in typical mayo, beware that soy and/or canola oil is listed as the first ingredient in this product.  Full ingredient list:<br />Organic expeller pressed soy and/or canola oil, organic whole eggs, organic egg yolks, organic extra virgin olive oil, filtered water, organic honey, organic distilled vinegar, sea salt, organic mustard (organic distilled vinegar, water, organic mustard seed, salt, organic spices), organic lemon juice concentrate."
2,"Unlike many other reviewers of this product, I think nothing of pumping my body full of saturated fats, high-fructose corn syrup, or less-than-whole grains.  In fact the Back To Nature graham crackers landed right next to the Keebler ones in my pantry.<br /><br />So that said, I tried.  I tried to like this healthier alternative, and I just can't quite.  The crackers themselves are a bit tough for a graham cracker (you certainly wouldn't want to use them for a pie crust), and the texture is more like a multi-grain bread than less healthy competitors in the cookie aisle.  To be fair the honey flavor is much stronger and truer than Keebler and Nabisco have been able to synthesize and is definitely the high-point of these grahams.  The oats, on the other hand, are also fresh and prominent, and less in a good way.<br /><br />For a non-health food junkie like me, it's just a little too hard to get past the ""healthy"" taste and texture of the Back To Nature graham crackers.  If you're looking for an alternative to total junk food, this could be your option, just be aware there may be some adjustment while you acquire the taste."
2,"People who take candy seriously are a vulnerable group.  So why name a straightforward candy ""nerds""?  It seems like you are poking fun at your supporters.  Especially for the sour ones (which are I think the best), the conventional thing would be to call them something like ""McGillicutty's"" and have a picture of a scowling Irishman.  The candy itself is just going to be sugar, corn syrup, stabilizers and some flavoring--the name is what gives you a sense of what it is.<br /><br />In general, the Wonka lines have been a depressing experience.  First, no one should have been so cynical as to use the name ""Willy Wonka"" for real candy.  It's like Fruit of the Loom having ""Thomas Jefferson"" briefs.  And I'll get back to that.  But second, the candy has consistently been uninventive, third rate, and with no particular appeal.  All it does is drag W.W.'s image into the ground as opposed to it being an inspiration.<br /><br />And as we all know, Wonka is now actually a part of Nestle's.  Now as someone previously in the candy business, I have to say that Nestle's main-line and high-quality line products in the candy/chocolate world are pretty good.  But as a company, Nestle is a nightmare--poisoning pets, starving babies.  If Nestle owned the real Willy Wonka factory, the Oompa-Loompas would turn out to be slaves.  I just can't understand a world in which Nestle owns the right to put out low grade candy and call it Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Willy Wonka represented the dream of doing good, being a child, and being honest.  That was why Charlie got the factory--because he precisely wasn't the kind of guy who would go far in Nestle's.  I feel like in this product, Nestle is basically saying to Charlie, ""you're a nerd!  Maybe you can work in the tech department programming the payroll computers!  But you sure as heck can't run the factory and we're not interested in any of your spacey ideas!""<br /><br />And one last thing--if you're my age, you've probably had to listen, more than you wanted to, to the song ""Nurds"" (the spelling was ""charmingly"" wrong) by the Roches.  Now if there's one thing you don't want associated with your candy product, it's roaches.  Animal contamination is always a real threat, and it's often not taken seriously enough.  So, Nestle, when you were done with your ethically-dubious activities in the third world, you somehow chose a name for a candy that would both spit in the face of Charlie Bucket and make the consumer queasy.  Who's running this show? [15]"
2,"For expensive saffron, I was not impressed with the flavor.  It did color my food, but I thought the flavor was too mild."
2,"Very tasty chips( ORIGINAL AND OTHER FLAVORS ),but ones with salt flavor way too salty.Not sure who likes so much salt in chips.."
2,"It does say sweet matcha, but the sugar is way too much. Rishi is a great company and I love their teas, but this one is not worth the money. You can buy sugar from the grocery store for less."
2,"I was thrilled to receive my order and pleased with most of the variety but I was very disappointed that more than one third of the product had expired dates on them, if any date at all.  One was even totally dehydrated to a mere pea size.  Unfortunately, due to some chaos in my life, I didn't bother returning them."
2,"the cheerios were stale.  not to the point that i didn't eat them but it was noticeable.  also, i can get these in this size for $2.50 a box at dollar general.  i thought it was going to be nice to get them by mail to my back door, but it's just not gonna work out!"
2,"I got the ""souper"" size version. Let me remind you my dog is a 1yr old, 25lb male Boston Terrier. I bought this as an alterenative because it was edible. I bought the ""souper"" size thinking that he would take FOREVER to chew this. I had gave it to him, and at first he was a bit scared of it. Once he got started there was no stopping him. He ate 90% of it in an hour! If your looking to buy this to keep your dog busy, beware. If a small Boston can chew a ""souper"" size in little over an hour imagine what bigger dogs could do. For the price, I wouldnt recomend this to anyone. It's just like a ""souper"" size cookie."
2,"I am not picky about chewing gums, I don't remember to have ever found one I did not like.<br />This one... well I cannot say I like. The tastes vanishes SO quickly you can barely realize what it tastes like. Literally, within a minute, any flavor is gone. The texture is harder than most gums, but that is not even the problem. The point is that it feels like having a piece of tasteless rubber in your mouth after 30 seconds of chewing. Not recommended."
2,"I am a big fan of chai lattes and the spices in this blend are quite tasty. If you use the recommended 8oz setting, it has a full enough flavor. My biggest complaint is the artificial sweetener. It leaves that horrible chemical aftertaste that diet sodas do. If you don't have a problem with Splenda and you like spiced chai, this is the K-cup for you! If you are like me though, and have an aversion to artificial sweeteners, it looks like we are still stuck with brewing the tea (such as Celestial's India Spice Chai) and adding our own milk and sugar."
2,"These may taste just ok, don't taste the peanutbutter.  I keep ordering them just to have something for between meals.  They are a little too hard to bite and chew for my taste."
2,"I bought these hoping to trap the occasional in home cockroach (ours are quite large) but they're nowhere sticky enough to trap a large one.  I managed to chase one directly into a trap and it took but 10 seconds to work its way right back out - and another one that I placed moved about 3 inches from where it was but had nothing in it.  These will probably work fine if your bugs are small but don't count on it to do anything with the big ones."
2,"I dont' know why but they don't work with my coffee makers. Clear water comes out and is nasty. I know LAvazza makes great coffee but not these pods. they don't work.<br /><br />too bad."
2,"One of the really big selling points of the Keurig brewer was that it produced hot beverages other than just coffee.  Teas, cappuccinos and hot chocolates were all available and we were eager to try them.  I did my research after we got our brewer for Christmas, though, and was really disappointed to read a pile of negative reviews for pretty much every hot chocolate brand available.<br /><br />The Swiss Miss hot chocolate was on sale at our local grocery store so we decided we had to try it.  It had ranked a little bit higher than most of the other brands so I held out hope that it would work out.  I brewed a small cup when we got home and gave it a shot.  The consistency that came out of the machine was nice and the consistency didn't seem watery.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like the no calorie Swiss Miss hot chocolate available in sleeves.  While you're drinking it, it tastes alright, but then it's followed by a very plasticy synthetic aftertaste.  There's no mistaking the artificial sweetener here and I can see how that would bother a lot of people, especially those with sensitive taste buds.<br /><br />I think we'll finish the rest of the box, but I'm not convinced we'll repurchase.  We'll probably just use the Keurig to prepare the water and then use traditional hot chocolate packets."
2,"This is a great bone that lasts my dogs forever, but you can buy them in dollar stores! Totally unfair to charge 7x the price!"
2,"I agree with the other reviews--great product.<br /><br />BUT, when the product is packaged in a box so useless, i wont ever buy again.  The parchment is supposed to be ripped along the side of the box.  You know: where other boxes have a jagged edge?  This has NOTHING.  Seriously, they expect you to rip the parchment along the bare edge of the flimsy cardboard box holding it.  It never works...i've had friends and family take shots at it.  So far NO ONE has been able to get a straight tear...<br /><br />So if you get this, be sure to have scissors nearby!  :("
2,"I don't advise you to buy these unless you enjoy artificial cheese and the waffie itself has no taste to it.(I thought they were going to be cheese flavored) I feel like I wasted the money on my gift card. NEVER will purchase these again. I had to give them away to some kids."
2,"I have a 6yr old beagle who doesn't have much teeth and like to gum things to death.  I bought this product thinking the name ""Everlasting"" Treat Ball would be great for my almost toothless sweet heart...well she loved it! great!  I would give it to her for 15-20 min increments.  One day I thought I would give it to her while I ran some errands...I was about 1/2 an hour, came home to a destroyed ball.  It was all in pieces.  Thank God she didn't eat and choke on the rubber pieces.  Everlasting it sure isn't!"
2,"I had a feeling when I opened the box that this wasn't going to be as good as it looked in the picture. Included therein were a package of orzo-style pasta, a big pouch of Velveeta cheese, an envelope of seasoning and another small, flat envelope marked ""broccoli florets."" Inside the latter envelope was a tablespoon or so of grey-green flakes which may have at some point been broccoli, but were nothing you could call a floret in this stage of it's existence. Now, I know this is packaged food and it's not going to be anything to write home about, but honestly, I don't think the company should be allowed to claim that this dish contains broccoli. A few green-gray flecks can hardly be called a vegetable.<br /><br />Preparation was relatively easy. I browned the chicken I was adding (the box calls for 1 pound, which in my case consisted of two chicken breast halves, halved again so there were four pieces total.) To the thoroughly cooked chicken I added 2.5 cups of water, the seasoning packet and the pasta. During the course of cooking the pasta swells up and it was a nice texture and consistency on its own. After simmering the mixture a few minutes I added the packet of alleged broccoli florets, of which there were far too few to affect the look, let alone the taste, of the concoction. Stirring continuously because the pasta wanted to stick to the bottom of the pan, I found the mixture was taking on a slimey look as the moisture evaporated a bit. The final step was to stir in the packet of cheese. In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit I'm not a Velveeta fan, but my father loves it and I fed this to him, too. The cheese was bright orange goop and per the instructions I mixed it into the dish hoping it would taste better than it looked. It didn't. More importantly, my dad, who LOVES Velveeta and any other kind of American cheese dish, didn't like it. The prepared dish had a strange texture that wasn't appetizing at all. He's not a picky eater, and if he won't eat it, you can bet it's damned near inedible. I can't recommend this product."
2,"While this protien shake is one of the better tasting I've had, it's not a real protien shake. This only has 10grams of protien compared to most shakes that have about 30g and up.<br />The real ""keep away"" factor for me is that this shake has 29 g of carbs/ 18 g of this is SUGAR. If you're serious about weight loss, there are much better protien shakes on the market.<br /><br />Try EAS Whey Protien - It comes in a bag and each serving contains 170 calories/only 3 grams of carbs and 30g of protein. I haven't tried chocolate but vanilla is very tasty, especially with (skim)or almond milk.<br /><br />In response to a user comment, yes this product is marketed as an ""appetite suppressor"" rather than protein shake - however, if you're trying to lose weight - you will need to avoid sugary products, such as this. Spring for a protein shake with MORE protein and LESS sugar. The EAS Whey Protein will NOT taste as good - Special K drinks do taste much better - that is for sure (18 grams of sugar!). Sometimes as a 'treat' I will take 1 scoop EAS Whey Protein (chocolate) , 1 banana, 1 cup almond milk and 1 cup ice - blend well in a blender - and you have a DELICIOUS and HEALTHY protein shake."
2,"This K-Cup was one of the samples that came with my Mr. Coffee BVMC-KG1 Single Serve Brewing System, Silver.  I hate to be the lone dissenter, but I didn't like this coffee at all; in fact, it was the first of the four samples I've tried so far that I did not like.  To me, it tasted like over-brewed coffee--i.e., like coffee that has been sitting in the pot for several hours.  It wasn't bitter, exactly, but it just did not have a particularly appealing flavor.  I definitely would not buy this coffee again, and I would not recommend it."
2,"I followed the directions exactly and got stiff, dry noodles and a gummy tasting sauce.  I won't buy again.  Really wish I could return the other 5 boxes!"
2,"I received this product as a gift. I have baked scones from scratch many times and have eaten other prepared scones and bakery scones. These scones, in general, are unremarkable - OK, but nothing extraordinary. If you truly know what a scone should be, please do not be lead astray by its attractive packaging or the gloating reviews it received.<br /><br />This scone mix does have some merits. First, its ease of preparation of just adding water made quick work and a marketable selling point. Next, the scones do bake up tender as a scone should be. The ingredients are on the whole, and for the most part natural without unnecessary stabilizers and dough conditioners. I applaud any baking mix today that doesn't resort to artificial ingredients or preservatives.<br /><br />This is a shelf-stable mix so therefore a crucial ingredient, like butter, is substituted with cheaper canola oil. This sacrifices flavor and texture. There was an insufficient amount fruit in the scone. Since it was a gift, I do not know the exact price for the product, but from what I see being sold at Amazon, it is not economical. You could easily make your own scones resulting in higher quality and quantity. Scones are actually simple baked goods because there is not much to them that requires much time. The simplicity of them makes them divine and something not to skimp upon."
2,"This eleven pound serving of Diet Coke, tastefully ensconced in a convenient twelve ounce can, is perhaps deceptive. Its mass might lead the consumer to believe that it somehow tastes different than the usual nutrient-free, chemically-laden glop that comprises Diet Coke, which seems to have become the International Women's Beverage. (As a person with a Y chromosome, I do not have the gender qualifications to drink this beverage, but I tried one anyway, along with some yogurt, the International Women's Food, as suggested by The Lifetime Channel and their wonderful films.) After careful evaluation, I determined that the eleven-pound mass of this can was not achieved by the addition of fruit juices or any actual nutritional food-like ingredients to the chemical glop. I now realized that some of the carbonated ""bubbles"" are actually black holes, a de-formation of space-time caused by collapsing stars, formerly difficult to obtain for the consumer but now conveniently available in these handy eleven-pound cans of diet coke. (I tried to give this product a five-star review, but somehow the five stars collapsed into two stars that each weigh 5.5 pounds.) Buy it! Drink it! The Black Hole Diet will not make you lose mass (quite the opposite), but it is entertaining and educational, and you can participate in the International Women's Cuisine Mandate while watching films about deceptive men on The Lifetime Channel."
2,"My 55pound pitt mix has been able to eat nearly anything till now. After all the good reviews I gave them a try. He loves them (like anything else which is in a plastic thing) but he gets the runs shortly after getting 4 or 5 of them... pity"
2,"I'd like to start by saying that I rarely leave negative reviews. I'd like to add that my dog isn't a picky eater. Now that that's out of the way, these apparently healthy vegan treats are hard (brittle might be a better word), have no enticing aroma, and are not appealing to my 2-year-old toy breed. I stupidly bought a bag of every flavor since the reviews were so positive and since vegan dog treats are relatively hard to find (I'm in Florida). Now I have 4-5 bags of these that I can't use. Annoying."
2,"This is the only food that has worked for my dog, and then they started adding a bunch of other ingredients that don't seem necessary.  The point of a hypo-allergenic food is to have ONE protein and ONE carb.  Suddenly there's quinoa and kamut flakes.  I don't think they're too much of an issue (yet), but the inclusion of apples is a definite problem.<br /><br />Now I need to find another hypo-allergenic food...."
2,"We have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past, but this order is inferior. Did the company change hands or outsource their production?"
2,"VERY!!! Disappointed with the ingredients.  I used to buy the rice milk in Mississippi, but can never find it in Ohio.  When I search on amazon.com for gluten free milk, Imagine Rice milk pops up, but it in not gluten free and not corn free.  I can not tolerate corn either.  Oh well, I'll have to continued searching for a rice milk that is 100% gluten free and 100% corn freed.  Shipment was fast and boxes were in excellent condition."
2,"Yes, these bars are SO tasty. They are chewy, chocolatey bars of delight.<br /><br />However, if you don't want to risk an embarrassing situation later, don't eat one for breakfast. It doesn't seem to happen with everyone, but I've eaten two of these in the past month, and both times they've given me horrible, annoying gas."
2,"Hello Brownie Lovers! Unfortunately I love brownies, and unfortunately I have dietary restrictions that forbid me from eating the Sugars. So unfortunately I found myself in possession of a box of Doctor Carbrite Diet Brownies. My Moms-in-Law gave them to me for Christmas. So with the whole family over, I decided to mix up a batch of these devilish delights.<br />Well, let me tell you, I don't know what Doctor would recommend the intense intestinal distress caused by these brownies. Holy Hell! Myself and my Christmas guests were utterly disgusted by the brown, methane cloud that resulted from my consumption of said brownies. I have since discovered other foods which contain Malitol (artificial sugar-izer) and carry a warning of ""may cause possible intense intestinal distress"". Well let me just cut to the chase for you: These brownies cause some seriously foul smelling gas. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 beacuse they DID taste pretty good goin' down. Thanks for that Dr. Carbrite, of that is your real name."
2,"The black salt seems a little bit mouisture.  When you are seasoning in you dish or pan, the black colour may spread over.<br /><br />""Although not as popular as the traditional red alaea salt, hawaiian black sea salt, or lava salt, is a dramatic, glossy black sea salt.  The unique color comes from lava, which adds minerals and activated charcoal which results in a sulfuric aroma and earthy flavor.<br /><br />hawaiian black sea salt is used both as a finishing salt and a roasting salt.  It is often used as a coating on fish to help preserve both flavor and moisture as it bakes.<br /><br />suggested uses:<br /><br />Delicious on all types of seafoods, especially shellfish such as clams, mussels or scallops."" - By www.faeriesfinest.com"
2,"My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally ""stew,"" with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer."
2,"I bought this cause it was organic and fair trade. I like just green tea, this is like ground up flowers and strong floral taste. I am so not a fan! Giving this 2 stars cause the flavor giving it 5 stars for being organic and fair trade"
2,"My dog got horrible diarrhea from it.<br />We mixed it with her old food for about a week and after that gave her just the Canidea food.<br />Too bad, it seemed like a good brand though."
2,"Two days after this plant arrived - ALL it's leaves fell off like the first cold snap of an Eastern Fall - I'm trying to get it to come back to life.... no success as yet - perhaps this plant is too fragile to be shipped."
2,"Badoit is refreshing and has delightfully small bubbles. Is it worth this much money? Well, writing from Paris, where Badoit is cheap and plentiful, people seem to like Perrier and San Pellegrino just fine. Given that home carbonation can make perfectly good soda for very little money, I would have to suggest saving your hard-earned cash for a decent bottle of wine."
2,"What can I say, I gave them a shot. The assortment of chips they send with this pack is well shipped and stored, however I just wasn't a fan of the taste of the product. I tried many times to eat Pop Chips with salsas, dips, tuna, etc... and I just couldn't get used to the taste. In my opinion they are extremely bland, even when well seasoned. Again, I was impressed with the product packaging and nutrition, just not the taste. I'm a chip junkie, so I was pretty bummed when I didn't like them. I can suffer through baked chips, but Pop Chips aren't for me."
2,"You can't even taste the nuts. It's just hot habaneros. May be good for cooking... but pretty much not enjoyable as a nut."
2,"I really wanted to like this product but found that it really did not have much flavor.  I had to add some grated Romano cheese to it to make it more palatable.  The picture on the package does not look anything like the end product.<br />The pasta did not cook evenly and ended with some falling apart while other bits were still tough and chewy.<br />I certainly would not purchase it at the regular price."
2,"Although not exactly as I remember raisin bread, it's a welcome treat after so long without. It has a good texture, toasts well, but could have more cinnamon flavor. It is somewhat pricey, but I miss bread, so I splurge a little.<br /><br />Update: I need to warn consumers that, although this packaging should last until the expiration date, you must examine this bread before you use it. At $44+ you can't eat this bread too fast, even though it is light. As I got to the last three loaves, I noticed mold on most of the slices. I hoped none was tainted that was already eaten. It was well before the expiration date. I now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again. The Ener_G company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves. They asked why I didn't order from them. From now on, I think i will. It can't be any more expensive. This price is no bargain."
2,"We have a horrible time getting allergy medication into our two cats (both have allergies, but we<br />live in the allergy capital of the USA, and we have them too).  During the spring bloom and fall<br />harvest time, we need to give them allergy meds.  I thought these might help.<br /><br />They didn't.<br /><br />Neither cat will touch them, even without a pill.  I did try the pockets without medicine in them<br />first, so they would not be suspicious the next time. They both turned up their noses and walked away.<br />These are cats who will knock you down to get chicken!<br /><br />So, can't recommend them for cats in general, but I am sure they'd work well for dogs."
2,"If you like a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you will prob like this.  I personally do not...  Fake super sweet yucky flavor.<br />Instant coffee with a lot of ""bad for you"" stuff."
2,"Pepsi is a good drink, but like others have said, it is way overpriced.  Just save your money and buy some at a store instead."
2,"Seriously, this is the worst tasting grape juice I've ever ingested.  Tastes like it's 2/3 water and 1/3 grape juice.  Talk about a misleading label!  Says 100% juice.  I would beg to differ.  For reference, I've drank many brands of grape juice from the obvious Welch's to any old store brand.  The kicker is on the label there's a gold medal this was awarded for superior taste.<br /><br />Don't waste you money on this.  Would never buy again."
2,"This jam tastes as if it was made of anything but roses.  No aroma at all.<br />By the time you pay for the shipping, may as well buy something else in the local grocery store."
2,"This sweetener has a bitter after taste, the pure liquid Stevia is much better (NuNaturals Nustevia Alcohol Free Stevia Glass Bottle Liquid, 2-Ounce)"
2,"This was not Teavana tea. This is false advertising. Report.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006UGNF9Q"">Teavana Almond Biscotti Black Tea, 8oz</a>Teavana Almond Biscotti Black Tea, 8oz Organic Fancy Leaf"
2,"So the reason I gave this product 2 stars and not one is because it is fair trade and organic however, I was incredibly disappointed in this honey in general - I enjoy crystallized honey, but the flavor on this is just off somehow.  It *could* be the plastic.  When the package arrived the plastic smell was incredibly strong, took several hours to dissipate and even days later the containers still smelled bad.  I ended up ordering a different brand, Y.S. Organic Bee Farms, and there is just no comparison in flavor and texture - I will not order the Wholesome brand again.  Incidentally, when the new honey arrived, I still had one jar of the Wholesome left, which I put in the garbage - I didn't want anyone else thinking this is what honey should taste/smell like."
2,"My family loves bagels - good, chewy, hearty bagels. Living where we do, we can't always get such a thing, but we are always willing to try.  I tried these because I got a bzz campaign and my friends all said they were awesome - they'd been paying full price and eating them every day.  I thought this was great until I took my first bite.  I understand that they are supposed to be thin and all, but I was expecting it to taste like a bagel.  I did not!  It tasted like a bread end that just happened to have a hole in it.  A bagel should be boiled and baked and lots of tooth to it.  My daughter didn't care for them either (she's 7) and said the only way to eat it was to put more cream cheese on it so she couldn't taste the bagel.  So, I passed along the rest of the campaign coupons to the friends that love them.  I'll reserve my bagel eating for an occasional full size one from a place that makes them fresh."
2,"For a decaf coffee, I personally feel that it has too much kick!  It is very strong; a lot stronger than I was searching for.  I personally drink decaf at night and prefer a subtle cup of joe.  WIth this, I was forced to add water to make it tolerable.  Secondly, be careful, I was sent a double order upon shipment accidently and now am stuck with coffee I do not like. It is very bitter."
2,"I was disappointed in this product especially considering how exceptional the Salmon Oil they make is.<br /><br />This did not pass the 11 rescue dog test! They just turned up their noses. So did the other dogs here. Very tiny tidbits, as well.Buy an extra bottle of the Grizzly Salmon oil instead."
2,"We love these bars but i won't order them shipped from anywhere anymore.  They came melted, white, and didn't taste as good as they do when they are fresh."
2,"Love the idea of a low calorie popcorn as a snack while on a diet. But this one is pretty flavourless. It is a wise decision from a healthy point of view, but beware the lack of flavour."
2,"As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up. I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass."
2,"I was trying to increase my consumption of coconut products without increasing my intake of sugar.<br />Unfortunately this pina colada mixer has ~ 22 grams of sugar (sorry I don't have it<br />in front of me, but it was way over what I allow in a day), so I won't be buying it<br />again!"
2,"My son enjoys this product, and I don't blame him.  It is SWEET.  Not surprisingly, since the first ingredient is JUICE, which is basically adding just empty calories for sweetness (as my pediatrician confirmed).  I won't be buying this product again.  Babies need whole fruit ingredients - juice is not considered an ideal food for them.  I also saw that Sprout's pack with cinnamon apple oatmeal also has juice listed as the first ingredient."
2,"I ordered two of these ""fresh, whole rabbits"" because I thought they would make excellent pets for my kids.  Imagine our shock, horror, and disgust when they arrived dead and mutilated.  Someone had killed the rabbits, skinned and gutted them, and even cut off their ears!<br /><br />I have ordered a second pair of rabbits, because I can't believe whatever horrible accident befell the first pair could possibly happen again.<br /><br />P.S.: I rated this two stars instead of only one, because we decided to eat the rabbits and they were tasty when sauteed with butter and onions, just like chicken or cat."
2,"I think the chocolate chip cookie mix just really isn't that good, Pamela's Incredible Chocolate Chunk Cookies Mix is fantastic, probably better than any other chocolate chip cookie even with gluten.<br /><br />1. What is that taste? I think it is too much xanthan gum - it is this fake sickly sweet flavor that leaves an aftertaste on your tongue like those fake sugars or Stevia. If you just eat one cookie it's not a problem, but eat a few too many and you might just be wishing for anything to remove the taste. (I bake a lot and in my opinion one of the problems with a lot of recipes is that they call for too much xanthan gum - you can get a great affect with much less. Unless you are using a mix, and then you have no choice.)<br /><br />2. not enough/not big enough chocolate chips<br /><br />3. my batches wound up really really chewy, like gnaw on it/exercise your jaw chewy. some people liked this, others didn't.<br /><br />So, if this is the only one you can get then go for it but if you have other options I would try those."
2,"I really don't like these.  They are weak in that sweet, cinnamon flavor, and do not last long at all.<br /><br />It's really a shame the[...]gent passed away.  He had the absolute best cinnamon toothpicks money could buy."
2,"I bought this product and another brand (very well known for their chocolate) and did a taste test.  The Smucker's brand was quite NASTY!  It doesn't even remotely taste like chocolate, and it doesn't harden like the other brand.  I love Smuckers Jams & Jellies, but they just don't have what it takes to make this chocolate topping.  Smuckers's, please do us a favor and stick to jams and jellies."
2,"This hot chocolate was watery and had a chemical after-taste!  My husband agreed.  I gave it 2 stars rather than one because I did finish the cup and didn't gag, but I probably won't finish my other discs, I'll save them for unwelcome visitors."
2,"Over priced Tea, Not much Jasmine Aroma or Flavor. I do not recommend this Tea. Will not purchase again. Like I said in the title, ""DISAPPOINTED""."
2,"I am not too happy with this, the cookies are supposed to be covered in white powder, the powder is now brown, you have to buy in a large quantity and I can't send back the item after I saw and was not happy with it."
2,"I recently got a puppy from a shelter. They insisted on this food and gave me a free bag. Its terrible! My puppy is 5 months and It makes her get the ""runs"" and the worst farts you can imagine! I can't even finish out the bag...and its FREE!! I even went as far as putting her on a chicken and rice diet and gradually putting her on this food and she still can't handle it."
2,"Yuck - these definitely ain't Pirates Booty!  I thought these were gross.  I don't understand all the glowing reviews for these cardboard flavored discs."
2,"The Company:  ""ITAL stands for all things Pure, True and Vital.  We believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial"".<br /><br />They also claim to treat their workers ethically and they know where their beans come from and how they are grown(?).  They are committed to ""sourcing the finest  quality 100% Arabica beans"".  Their ""organic coffees are Fair Trade Certified and USDA approved"".  The company started the ""Kicks For Cause Foundation"" of which partial proceeds form coffee sales go towards youth soccer programs.<br /><br />The Coffee:  I like good coffee.  This tastes like instant coffee.  The packets are nicely designed and the coffee is fresh, but the taste is  bland. Even with two packs per cup, the taste was very mild.  I also did not get much of a caffeine kick.  But what do you expect when the cost is about 'sixty-six cents' a packet?  You get what you pay for."
2,"I got these to try with my 6 month old son - YIKES! It was a watery disaster. It sure tasted good, but he hardly got any in his mouth because it was like feeding him soup."
2,"because it isn't bacon.  It tastes like Baco's, which don't taste like bacon.  I fail to understand how anyone who really loves bacon can be satisfied with an imitation."
2,"Unfortunately, I haven't found anything I can make this coffee in where the filter doesn't become instantly clogged.<br /><br />The filter on my French press is quite tolerant being a decent model but the grinds still get through the filter quite excessively.<br /><br />With a drip coffee maker, a permanent gold filter has no chance, as the fine grind blocks the filter and quickly causes the coffee maker to overflow. Paper filters are even worse, clogging up almost instantly.<br /><br />I'll end up giving it away since I can't actually make a good batch without excessive messes."
2,"Pretty sure this stuff is giving all six of my foster kittens diarrhea, which neither their dry kibble (Blue Buffalo Wilderness Kitten) nor their alternative wet food (Fancy Feast Classic grain-free varieties) do. I don't think they absorb much in the way of nutrition when the food shoots right through them, and of course it's a messy experience for me. Not a fan of this product."
2,"If you prefer the taste of coconut water, then this item is not for you. However if you are looking for a substitute for a hydrating drink then this is a good alternative.<br /><br />It takes some experimentation to come up with the amount that suits your taste.<br />I prefer 3 scoops with a pinch of sugar although it doesnt come close to coconut water taste.<br />The downside of using more than one scoop is the salty aftertaste of the residue.<br /><br />2 stars since its not close to taste of natural coconut water.<br />3 stars as an alternative to hydrating drink.<br /><br />a single serving size of 1tbsp contains the following:<br />40  Calories<br />40mg  Sodium<br />326mg Potassium - this is 10% of the daily value<br />8g  Sugar<br /><br />3%  Calcium<br />6%  Manganese<br />15%  Magnesium<br />100% Vitamin C"
2,"I am a huge iced coffee/hot coffee/everything coffee fan... but this iced coffee has a very ""fake"" taste. I was disappointed by the lack of real coffee flavor. If you like whipped cream and syrups in your iced coffee, this may work for you. I will stick to the hot Donut Shop flavors!"
2,"This is one of my favorite cereals. But purchase it only if you don't mind eating it in powder form. What you get is mostly powder, not crunchy squares. I will not be ordering again, sorry."
2,"The POP tarts were very stale and the box was partially opened, it was very poorly handled. Now I feel that I would rather visit the store, than purchasing them online. Just wasted the money."
2,"The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad."
2,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:48 Mins<br /><br /></span>meant to say Thanksgiving, not Halloween. this was a fun review for me to do. thanks for watching.<br /><br />edit: October 23, 2010 (the next day) after having 2 more cups, I do agree with the other reviewer that this coffee is weak. The cup I had this morning, I added 3 teaspoons of sugar and the taste was better, but still not one of the better varieties out there. I think a mix with more coffee would have helped. If you've already bought this variety I recommend brewing it with the smallest cup setting. Peace out"
2,"According to the package, this is 100% natural coconut water. It doesn't taste bad at all, but nor does it taste sensational or amazingly fresh. Maybe it simply loses something when it's not drunk directly and immediately from the coconut shell? I probably would not try it again."
2,"I usually drink a 5-hour Energy drink<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GX1K14"">5-Hour Energy Extra Strength (24 Bottles Grape)</a> when I first get up so that I can quickly get in to my morning P90X routine. I put one on my nightstand before going to bed and quickly drink it down in the morning. I don't much care for the taste (though I don't exactly hate it) but I like the effect of energy drinks on my exercise performance, and that is why I decided to give this No Fear drink a try. I was disappointed and will stick with 5-Hour Energy. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1 - Calories: At 260 calories a can, there is a 65X difference. It does not fit in with my nutrition goals.<br /><br />2 - Taste: It's a little sweeter than a Red Bull. I don't much like Red Bull though and the flavor of No Fear was not an improvement over 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />3 - Size: This is a BIG can yet it has roughly the same amount of caffeine, taurine, etc as 5-Hour Energy. Why drink this massive can of fluid when a small shot will do? If I REALLY enjoyed the taste, I might feel otherwise.<br /><br />4 - Energy Boost: I found the effect of No Fear to be similar to that of 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />Bottom line: 5-Hour Energy works better for me."
2,"They shipped 6 business days (8 real days) after my order.  And the arrival date exceeded Amazon's max. estimate by 3 business days.  It seems from their feedback page that they have been late many times but ppl are happy about the quality of tea.  I can understand that, but I guess the online stores I've been using are just too good.<br /><br />Also it doesn't say anywhere on the product whether the flavor is natural or artificial."
2,"Originally this product was advertised and labeled as ""Extra Bold"". Amazon did not offer a response, exchange, or refund, when the product was brought to their attention the second time it arrived. The K-cup product was later classified as ""Light Roast""."
2,"I was thinking this would be a nice break from the normal tea.  However it is a bit too spicy for my taste. Unless you really like the spice chai, I wouldn't recommend this tea."
2,"My dog had an increased interest in his food for a very short time after using this product, then he got tired of it like he does everything. So the search continues..."
2,"These cookies are cloyingly sweet, i had to throw out the middle as it tasted like sugar! The cookies themselves are hard without much flavor. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm wondering what to do with those that are left."
2,"For some reason, I was just not able to fully enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I tried to brew it different ways starting with the water temperature and brewing length.<br /><br />At best this tea was just okay when lightly brewed and some might enjoy the subtle flavor this way.<br /><br />I thought most jasmine blossoms take time to develop but the longer I brewed this tea, the more bitter it became and tasted so strange I had to dump it on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Due the ratings for this tea being very high on amazon.com, I wanted to like this tea and tried my best to enjoy it.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch, but for now I'll pass on this tea.<br /><br />* * 2 / 5 * * * * *<br /><br />Ciao"
2,"Its OK. It tasted more like sugar than pina colada :( i was a lit bit dissapointed. maybe because it was sugar free so it wasnt as tasty or good as I have expected it. But it really tasted like watery sugar."
2,"When fresh, Niederegger marzipan is out of this world. These bars arrived stale and dry, which sapped them of much of their flavor. Maybe take a chance if you've got to have marzipan and this is the only way to get it."
2,"I do NOT understand why they have to fry/bake for so long?? If they were not so over cooked, I would love it. Too bad!<br /><br />So far, I only opened one bag, I hope not ALL 12 bags are like this, although they may very well be since they must have been made and bagged together. I will have to complain to the manufacturer if that is the case!"
2,"I bought the hype about there being little difference between this and McCanns steel-cut.  Wrong!  If you have had the steel-cut, this stuff is just soupy and bland. And the fiber difference?  These oats are processed (cooked, rolled out, and cut into shapes), so in essence the fiber is gone  Convenience?  Big deal.  Make up a big batch of steel-cut, refrigerate and nuke as you wish."
2,"very small, much smaller than i expected and i measured it, it either is wrong or dimensions were wrong.Would not recommend at all."
2,"I found out that the Nestle European Style Mousse mix (the leading brand in the U.S.) is now sold under the Inspired Cuisine brand name.  It's still the best out there, by far."
2,"I don't know about you, but when I go looking for a product that explicitly states it has no added sugar, I mean sugar in the general, anything-that-is-chemically-sugar sense.  These folks make the ""no added sugar"" claim, and then follow it up with (oh by the way) ""a little bit of cane juice for sweetness.""  Which is to say, added sugar.  3 grams per serving, in fact, if my online search for this product's nutritional information is correct.<br /><br />Who are these people, unemployed politicians?<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Fifty50 brand.  Not only are they not lying through their teeth about not adding sugar, but they also donate half their profits to Diabetes research."
2,"I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."
2,"I agree with the other review. Beware: the plant is not as pictured or anything like it. I purchased this Desert Rose for my dad because he fell in love with the one in the photo and the description (~15 years old desert rose). The Amazon shipping weight says 21lbs, mine was UPS 3lbs. I was totally disappointed as I paid $95 with shipping just to get a desert rose that does not look like it's 15 years old. The caudex on the plant I got was only ~2-3"" wide and the one in the photo looks about ~6-7""+ wide.<br /><br />I contacted Lou immediately (I also have no idea why the seller's name is Sheryl when the actual seller is LouBonsai) and he is great at responding. He told me he would ship me a new plant and I kept emailing to make sure it's not just ANY desert rose, but SPECIFICALLY the one similar to the photo. However, their responses were brief and not descriptive about what they are sending (i.e. the response was ""BIGGER AS I WAS TOLD""). I felt as if my concerns were not answered. Lou said he was going to send me a new plant with a tracking number on 7/23 but I heard nothing. I had to email him on 7/25 to ask, they provided one and said I was able to track it the next day. It's 7/27 now and the UPS tracking number still says that a label has been created but package is not dropped off yet. I'm a very disappointed customer at this point.<br /><br />It would be nice for them to list the actual plant they are selling because it's definitely not the one I received.<br /><br />2 stars for responsiveness."
2,"Bought the SS525CS Light Duty Fence energizer to keep our minpins from digging out from underneath our fence.  It was our last resort since they broke through every other barrier we set up.  It did the trick!  We set it up at our new house so it surrounds the fence all the way around, and also set a single strand on the outside of the back of the fence, which butts up to vacant land where coyotes and stray animals run around.  We didn't want coyotes coming to our yard and digging in to get at the dogs, so this was a great idea.  We've heard loose dogs get shocked out back there, and that keeps our animals safe.  Well, unfortunately yesterday I heard the energizer making a louder than usual buzzing sound and knew that something was wrong.  We previously had a kitten get stuck on it on the inside of our yard (poor thing was scared half to death by the fence and the dogs!), and bit the wire.  It fried it's poor little mouth to the wire and his legs were stuck straight out. We turned the fence off but the poor little guy had been shocked terribly.  He ended up being ""ok"" and we found him a home.<br /><br />Yesterday when I heard the noise I freaked out and went looking around the perimeter, and found another stray kitten, with one of its rear paws stuck to the outer perimeter's line.  I couldn't save this one. The fence killed him.  The side of his body that was touching the ground was smouldering and burnt. I had to pick up the body and dispose of it.  I cried a LOT yesterday about this.  We have a cat and a kitten in our home and it devastated me that we were responsible for the death of this precious little life.<br /><br />But today, after thinking more about it and then going online to research, it turns out that the manufacturer knows that the energizers with ""CS"" in the model number (means ""Continuous Shock"") DO KILL small animals.  Despite thier knowledge of this, the company still advertises that ""No commercially made charger when installed properly will harm a pet or human.""  The problem isn't improper installation here; it's that the shock in this model is continuous and doesn't give a smaller animal the chance to pull away. Cats and kittens are notorious for biting at things that hurt them, and once they clamp down, there's no getting loose unless someone happens to see what is going on.  If you are considering an electric fence, be sure it is an Intermittent Shock energizer.  This means it pulsates and allows the animal to get off the wire.  As far as I'm concerned, the item I'm reviewing, SS525CS, is a death trap for small animals (and birds & frogs too)."
2,"If you put enough creamer in this coffee, it is tolerable.  It does not have a good coffee taste, and I would not buy it again.  It is also highly overpriced."
2,"i bought the smoother because i thought i needed one to make my daughters birthday cake, honestly i think i could have done the same thing with my hand.  really if the cake was smooth, you could do it close to smooth.  the cost is small enough where if you think you need one get one - but i'm not sure i would repurchase in the future if it broke or i lost it.  quality is that it is very thick and seems sturdy... just again not sure that i would ever really need one."
2,"I thought this was a fair price for these mushrooms, but was quite disappointed.  I soaked the mushrooms, as advised and then added them to a soup.<br /><br />The next trial was in a risotto.<br />The mushrooms lack flavor in general.  The stems of these mushrooms are quite inedible; they are very tough and have to be trimmed after soaking.  I would not recommend them and wouldn't repurchase."
2,"I happen to love blueberries so, I instantly thought I would love this item: hated it.  The product actually leaves a bad after-taste in your mouth.  It has very little blueberry filling in it as it is primarily a terrible cake wrapping that surrounds a scarce blueberry filling.  I can't recommend these to anyone unless their getting them free and even then I wouldn't eat too many of them as they seem to be horribly fattening.  Unfortunately I bought two packs of these things; wish I still had my dog.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5S6M"">Glutino Gluten Free Breakfast Bars, Blueberry, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
2,"My main beef with this product is with the labeling.<br /><br />The box is labeled very deceptively. This goes double when inspecting the packaging from the Web (as you are doing now). ""10 bars"" is prominently displayed on the box. Lo and behold, once you open the box, only five bars are present. Upon further inspection, you see that printed in mice-type on the box is ""5 two count packages"". The net weight of the entire box is 7.4 ounces. That's less than one cup of granola. That's when you realize you've been had.<br /><br />You can buy a mega-size box of Nature Valley granola bars from a warehouse club for less money than the ""Pack of 2"" you'll find here. I mention Nature Valley because in a blind taste test you won't be able to distinguish that brand from these Clif bars.<br /><br />Seriously, if they are selling them for this much on Amazon, I'd be shocked and chagrined to see what they go for at the camping stores which is their retailer of origin.<br /><br />I consider myself embarrassed to have been duped so badly on this one. Clif has seriously damaged their brand credibility. Live and learn."
2,"the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. I've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time I've used the Wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn."
2,"My 9 month old has been happily eating fruit and whole grain combo as well as veggie and meat foods from Earth's Best.  These ""gourmet"" flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!"
2,"I have been a Cheerios consumer for the full 25 years of my life, and I've seen the prices for the little O's slowly climb over the years.  But here, on Amazon, only last Spring this same set of 4-pack 14oz boxes was hardly $12 for the set!  Now it's almost doubled?!  Most groceries sell the 14oz box at about $4 a box, this is close to $6 a box.  I never thought I'd give Cheerios anything less than 5 stars.  Until Amazon's price goes back to normal I will be getting my Cheerios at Target, for around half the price."
2,"PROS<br />-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)<br />-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)<br />-baby loves them!<br /><br />CONS<br />-stains!  As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)"
2,"I ordered this item knowing it would be a variety pack and when it came out of the 210 pcs not 216 pcs there was only 2 and I mean TWO chocolate taffies. Boy was I really disappointed. I am not saying this is Amazon fault. I love shopping Amazon. I am making this all about Bonomos Turkish Taffy Tub 216 ct."
2,"These things are ok but they are so salty I can finish a bag."
2,"The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online."
2,"This stuff does taste kinda like starbucks. But with all the sugar I did'nt really enjoy it. Buy this if your running low on sugar and don't like green tea."
2,"We have purchased Pamela's products in the past and guess we thought we couldn't go wrong.  Then we bought the lemon blueberry bars.  My daughter, who has Celiacs, doesn't like them..  I tried them and I don't like them.  Unfortunately, I have a case of whenever bars that no one likes.  For future reference, we will definitely purchase a sample before the case."
2,"This adds Vitamin C and caffeine to your water, which is great for people who are looking for that.  Caffeine may boost your workouts, and is the daily drug of choice for many of us, but watch out for side effects and don't over do it.<br /><br />The deal breaker for me on this one was taste.  It tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch Kool-Aid, with a pronounced aftertaste.  I strongly prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X5FYJQ"">Optimum Nutrition Essential Amino Energy, Fruit Fusion</a>, a powdered caffeine add-on, or some of the Mio products."
2,"Whoever sells this makes a few claims that would be hard to verify without running some sort of scientific tests, such as the electrolyte thing and the 9.5 pH. But even if I assume that's all true, it still didn't do anything for me that regular water wouldn't--certainly not to an extent sufficient to assuage my guilt at using a non-biodegradable plastic bottle.<br /><br />I drank this 1.5 L bottle (Vine reviewers only get one) a glass at a time over the course of a few days, usually after running.  It was really no more refreshing than the water I usually drink out of my filtered tap. It quenched my thirst neither more quickly nor more slowly than usual. It tasted a bit different, but that's true any time I drink water that's not from my usual source. The taste was inoffensive, but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a ""silky smooth taste,"" which is what the bottle promises.<br /><br />And what can I conclude from all of this? That the experience of drinking this liquid is, in fact, no different from that of drinking plain old WATER!"
2,"I love  dried fruit and buy frequently. I have bought other products from Traverse Bay and truely enjoyed them But this product no so much.<br /><br />They berries are a generous size  and all are sliced. Unforutnately they found it necessary to overly sweeten the cranberries to the point that the cranberry flavor is totally overshadowed by the sweetness. Cranberries that are appropriated sweetened still have a slight tartness that allows the nature cranberry flavor to be perserved..<br /><br />These do not allow that..  after consumeing more than 1/2 of a one of the containers both right out of the box and also mixed in with nuts and as a add in for  cranberry muffins. I have been very disappointed..<br /><br />These will not be reordered and I orginally had this on a subscribe and save plan but canceld it after getting a good testing of this product.<br /><br />Will stick with Travese Bay Cherries or Blueberries.. going forward.."
2,"I like the convenience of this product, but it lacks the flavor of the ready made.  It tastes like a bit of artificial sweetner is used."
2,"I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles."
2,"I normally drink coffee in my keurig but I tried these for something different. They tasted almost like the weak hot chocolate you get out at an amusement park from a machine or something. I would not recommend them. I have a machine that lets you pick what size cup you want, small or medium and even on the small the hot chocolate is watery."
2,"For those expecting to really taste the pepper and sea salt, you might want to look a bit further before settling on this bar. While you can taste the salt right away it is quickly overwhelmed by the chocolate. The pepper is sadly indiscernable which may be because the spioes are not mixed into the chocolate but are lightly layered onto the bottom of the bar. Well-crafted overall, but disappointing otherwise."
2,"I used to have an Amazon subscription for Zico when it came in the cartons and wasn't made from concentrate. When Zico made the change, I decided to try one of their new bottles from a local store before starting a new subscription. I'm glad that I did because Zico now takes on par with the worst coconut waters I've ever had. It's not the worst, but it's down there with them. The difference is huge. It tastes slightly rotten now or you could imagine some of the coconut husk was accidentally added to the concentrate. I won't be getting Zico anymore.<br /><br />I tried several other brands to replace the old Zico but was disappointed in them all. I did finally find a replacement for Zico with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8SO10"">Naked 100% Naked Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. It's as good as the old Zico was if not better."
2,"For the price of this item, I expected much more than I got.<br />I went to Cracker Barrel and got much more and the<br />same items."
2,"I've struggled to get a good cup of coffee out of these.  They clog, they break, they generally make the process of making a cup of coffee arduous.<br /><br />I've been using melitta coffee filters until I bought a box of these filters, and never had a problem with them.  I will go back to Melitta and might not even finish using one box of these."
2,"The product is great, but . . .I got one box of 6 packets for $8.00 and it cost $6.00 to ship.  That was a bad choice for me."
2,"This is my favorite tea. I buy LOTS of it. But this was like someone hired their kid sister to cram a box full of old tea bags and ship it to me. Not impressed, Stash."
2,"Not worth the price!!! Has a very bitter taste!!!!! You have to add a ton of honey to it to make it worth a damn. Does not help coat the throat in anyway!!!!!!"
2,"I thought I was getting something special for my babies. It was marked down and I thought I was getting a steal. But I had second thoughts as soon as I opened the can. It looks like something you would spackle a wall with. Seriously, it has the consistency of paste. Thankfully, I have one cat that is my little garbage can and I know when he's really hungry that I can get rid of one of these Newman's Own Organic Beef cat food cans."
2,"These are the most delicious thing you will have ever tasted; however, they are loaded with fat.  If you are careful with fat in your diet for medical reasons (like me) or just don't want to abuse your body, avoid these at all cost.  They would be great as an addition to a picnic or a gift basket, but having more than one tub of these at home would be too great of a temptation for me.<br /><br />They are tasty, just be careful to eat one serving only."
2,"My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one."
2,"The case of necco wafers I ordered was shipped along with a raspberry candy item that was open and damaged the packaging for the wafers.  Very dissappointed.  These were a gift."
2,"It may be low acid, but the trade-off isn't worth it. The odor & the flavor are both poor, and the coffee is relatively weak, which I guess I shouldn't complain about - if I'm going to drink a cup of foul-tasting liquid, I'd prefer it to be as weak as possible!"
2,"I thought this was a fair price for these mushrooms, but was quite disappointed.  I soaked the mushrooms, as advised and then added them to a soup.<br /><br />The next trial was in a risotto.<br />The mushrooms lack flavor in general.  The stems of these mushrooms are quite inedible; they are very tough and have to be trimmed after soaking.  I would not recommend them and wouldn't repurchase."
2,"Really High in salt (3,250 mg/box) and a third of the calories are from FAT.  The package states that it contains less than 0.5% of MSG, etc....again with the neurotoxins!!!  The flavor is not really cheesy as you'd expect from the hype on the box.  The potatoes do remain firm though.  It's hard to describe the flavor.  Creamy yet artificial tasting. No, I really must NOT be sucked into buying these awful scalloped potatoes again.  Buy it at your own risk."
2,"This is the same brand, but not the same concentration (and therefore not the same flavor) as the Chai extract used by Starbucks. The extract used by Starbucks is more heavily concentrated and therefore more intense in flavor. Very disappointing."
2,"strong, not much flavor, very little aroma. I tried it once, will not purchase another time. I have other similiar brands that met the standards i expected."
2,"There is nothing wrong with the quality of this coffee. The trouble was we received a dozen or so k cups with no lids. There were coffee grounds in the bottom of the case but absolutely no lids. This made a good bargain into a not so good one. I reviewed the packaging mishaps on Amazon but have not gotten any responses!"
2,"Obviously, by looking at the other reviews people think this stuff is either really good or really bad. I think it is all according to your taste and what you are expecting for this price. I ordered packets from two different web sites and they both taste ok just like a frosty/rich shake ordered from a drive thru window. It was ok but I wouldn't pay the price for it again. I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix."
2,"I love some of the other Oskri bars, and when I found this one, I was thinking coconut with clusters of crunchy almonds. Shades of Almond Joy, which I can't have because of the sugar, etc., but these are a disappointment. They're big, and that's usually a plus, but I'm tired of it about midway through a bar. There may be 2 or 3 almonds throughout the bar, but they're soft, so you have to see one to know you've eaten an almond. The coconut and level of sweetness are good, but it simply gets boring after a bite or two. So, I've got a whole box of 'em to eat. Waste not, want not. I'll go back to the other Oskri bars, like the Almonds and Cranberry fiber bar."
2,"OUr first order came and it was pate, which is not what i was expecting. Some can's has fungus in them? Weird. I got my second pack and they were fine."
2,"This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar.  I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them.  Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something."
2,"I purchased due to one of the review saying this was much better than yoki tea,I feel this tea has a bitter taste and not much ginger,in fact I added ginger,which did not help the taste at all."
2,"Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith."
2,"I like all of the flavors to a degree, except this one.  It's really salty and the combination of flavors isn't good."
2,"I found two separate bags of these cherries to be dull and lifeless, with none of the zing I've found from other producers.  They were overly sweet in a way that seemed to mask the cherry flavor and had a texture that seemed almost cooked - mushy and gummy instead of chewy.<br /><br />I much preferred the Traverse Bay brand I purchased (here at Amazon) last year - that sample seemed fresher and less processed than these."
2,"I'm always looking for savory snacks. I gave these a try and threw away the rest of the box. They taste like fake potatoes with a faraway taste of sour cream and onion. I can't believe the positive reviews I've seen here. They must be from people who have given up on real food or have been dieting for so long that they've forgotten the taste of real sour cream and onions. Good luck and happy pound losing. I'll stick to something more sensible, like Town House Flatbread Crisps with Italian Herbs. Serving size - 6 little crackers - is 16 grams for a total of 70 calories per serving, vs. Special K's 55 calories. 20 more calories for a much better tasting snack with similar nutritional values."
2,"I don't know if it increased my milk supply because it was so disgusting that I could only stomach it a few times.  I suppose if you are desperate, but I would go with the fenugreek and blessed thistle  pills.  You have to take a lot of the pills, like 9 per day but at least I could manage to take the pills.  This stuff I had to force myself to drink, and it smells awful too."
2,"Sugar is the FIRST ingredient on the package (Organic Natural Evaporated Cane Sugar), however, when Amazon lists the ingredients they do not list them in the order on the package. Shame on Amazon. I love Amazon and order from them frequently every month and love their service. But regarding this issue I think THEY ARE WRONG not to voluntarily do the same thing. The government requires manufacturers to list ingredients in the order of largest content first. I had ordered this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because it sounded like a great product after reading the ingredient list on the site. Wrong. I had to relunctantly cancel it.<br />They taste great. No wonder with sugar as the largest ingredient."
2,"This K-cup was included in a ""Fall Mix"" that I purchased. I was disappointed when I saw that there was only one in the mix but I soon got over it as soon as I took a sip. It taste like Spiced Water... barely any coffee at all. Maybe it would be alright on the espresso setting on the Keurig but not the BIG cup."
2,"My review is not regarding after taste or the ingrediants as some people have complained about.<br /><br />I am strickly talking about the strawberry watermelon flavor.  out of a few flavors i've bought i would say this is my least favorite.... I would not recommend this flavor.<br /><br />thanks"
2,"Packing was not appropriate. The cardboard box was torn in several places. Cans were dented. One can had broken and leaked over at least 4 other cans causing a smelly mess. It was quite unpleasant."
2,"These sound like they would be so good.  I love fig newtons and imagined that there would be some fig filling in these.  Not so.  These are slim, crunchy sweet crackers.  If there is some fig in this it is very little.  A disappointment."
2,"Gum sticks to my teeth and flavor doesn't last long at all.  It's ok for vending machine gum and it was a decent price but the gum itself is not that good."
2,"I have bought this product a couple of times and really enjoyed it. BUT this last 2 bags has a weird smell and taste that seems stale or maybe chemical ish. A bunch of the pieces have an orange stain on them . I choose this product because it seemed a healthy alternative to satisfy my sweet tooth but now it has me concerned about the manufacturing."
2,"Well, what can I say?  I regret this purchase of Bridgeford Italian salami (I didn't buy the hard salami).  The quality of the salami is just so-so, not terrible but not comparable in quality to slightly more-expensive salamis available at my local grocers.  The taste?  Not bad but not great either, a walk on the mild side (in other words, bland and a bit rubbery-tasting).<br /><br />Stick with Hillshire Farm, Genoa, Gallo, etc...Bridgeford makes good pepperoni but their salami is sub-par and not worth the money."
2,"I tried three different flavors and they were all pretty bad. The texture is also kind of powdery instead of that crunchy chickpea texture you might expect. The sweet cinnamon flavor is probably the worst since it smells and tastes like an old peron's house(potpourri). I bought the small snack sized version for 99 cents each and ended up just throwing them away. Also the spices were unbalanced and unevenly distributed between the peas."
2,"This is probably good organic coffee in whole bean form.  It seems pretty fresh, even for ground coffee, and it's roasted the way I like it, which is medium-light.  The flavor (once you get some, more on that to follow) is mild.  It does have a weird aftertaste, which may be from the pods themselves or from the packaging.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is a wasteful, expensive way to brew a cup of coffee, and it undoes all the good of using organic, fair trade beans.  It's a packaged coffee inside a package that's inside a package of packages.  This wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the amount of coffee inside the pod were enough to brew a decent cup, but it isn't.  One pod brewed as recommended doesn't hold your cream and tastes like what you'd get at your great-grandma's house in outstate Minnesota.  You can read the date on a penny at the bottom of your cup.  Brewed according to the directions, this is worse than no coffee at all.<br /><br />Two pods in ten ounces of near-boiling water for 4-5 minutes makes an okay mug of coffee, but you use twice as much packaging and spend twice as much money.  Two stars for the fair trade.  No stars for anything else."
2,"Reading the reviews, I thought this would give a little kick to my coffee.  It doesn't do it, and here's why.  Even though the package says to limit to two per day, each shot only has 40mg of caffeine.  The average cup of coffee is around 100mg.  Energy drinks range widely, but 200mg seems to be in the ballpark, so two of these in a cup of coffee is still less than that.<br /><br />For those of you that get something out of this, great, but it's not comparable to an energy drink, imho."
2,"I bought these carob chips with the intentions of using them in carob chip cookies.  They taste great but the quality of the chips for baking purposes, is poor.  The chips melt out of the cookies and burn on the pan.  These chips would be best used in trail mixes or other snacks.  I did however, melt them and drizzle some over the cookies.  That was ok except that the carob never really fully dried, but instead made the cookies tacky sticky."
2,"I cut it up into smaller pieces for my terrier. She really seemed to go for the treat but after about 2 weeks, I think it's what's making her vomit. She is fine on the days I don't give it to her, but the handful of times I did, sure enough, the same day or next day, she would throw up.<br /><br />I'm returning the product. Also, it smells pretty bad. I'll stick to piggy slivers."
2,"Bottle was NOT as full as pictured here.<br />It was about 2/3 full.<br />The level was BELOW the bend or break in the neck."
2,"Unless your dog is younger and has great teeth, I do not recommend you try these. They are extremely hard."
2,"This maker got great reviews, but the machine I purchased was not the quality you would expect for the price. My machine is almost all plastic and the doors and trays do not fit snugly. I had to ship it back under warranty in under 3 months as it had quit working.  I had to foot the shipping to the warranty repair center to the tune of $35.<br /><br />When it was returned, day before yesterday, it was dirty and the repair order stated it was either my beans or water as the cause.<br /><br />We have used it for under 10 cups since and it's already not working properly again using their coffee.<br /><br />I would not purchase again.  I will say the customer service rep was very nice on the phone.... but that's not enough when spending $500."
2,"Wish I  liked it more.  Very good ingredients listed.  But it's wayyyy too sweet for me, which ditracts drom the flavor of the meat itself"
2,"Green Tea Pomegranate smells heavenly when you make it, but it will taste bland no matter how long you steep the tea bag."
2,"First time I purchased from this company and very disappointed as the coffee came all lose in the shipping box..Not even in their original manufacturers Keurig Tully Boxes.. some tops ripped open due to the packaging not to mention there are no expiration dates on these K-Cups.. Maybe this deal was too good to be true.. Do not recommend.. rather pay little more for quality packing and product...:("
2,"I ordered this K-Cup coffee on the favorable reviews of others.  But  - taste is subjective and this particular flavor of coffee has not made any impression on me.  It's not horrible - it's simply average and it hasn't captured my attention.  Because of that --- when I finish the last pod --- I will not re-order it."
2,"There were to be 6 dried samples of different types of mushrooms, but instead of the Melange de la Foret shown in the ad, which was wanted, there was a bag of Oyster mushrooms, which wasn't.  No communication from Amazon or Earthy Delights saying there was a substitution - even the shipment list was correct for what was ordered and advertised.  Wonder how careful these folks are about other things...."
2,"I won't go all the way to 1-star since this is probably more about me and not the foodstuff but, despite the claim that hemp seeds are not known to contain allergens, I did experience *some kind* of reaction to 4 tbsp of this stuff this past Monday, about 4 hours after ingesting it. I passed out, was shaking uncontrollably when I came to, felt tingling followed by a loss of sensation, nausea, pain, and shortness of breath. I realize correlation does not prove causation, but the health professionals whom I've consulted so far (which includes my primary) agree that there's a strong possibility that the episode was caused by something in the hemp seed, especially since I do not have a history of these kinds of incidents. I'm going for tests anyhow, and if it turns out that the hemp seed was not implicated, I'll update my review.<br /><br />Still, the moral of the story is, try just a little bit of this and any novel food or remedy before you take a full serving of it, lest you wind up at the ER like I did."
2,"I have tried several types of gf bread mixes with no problems.  For some reason, I can't get this one to set properly.  Every one of the three attempts I had resulted in bread that was wet in the middle.  I followed the ingredients and used my tried and true bread maker.  Each time, the bread was not done inside.  I would not recommend."
2,"I was not impressed with the quality of these vegetables, and I won't be buying them again.  The contents did not look or taste appealing.  There were a lot of potatoes, which I did not expect to find in mixed vegetables."
2,"people need to know from the seller how thin these sticks are because you think when you order your getting a good deal on price then you get them and they are thin and<br />you feel ripped off. They stink really bad. Bully sticks are a bulls penis. I looked that up on the internet. Yes dogs love them, but please supervise your pet as they get down to a nub quickly and could cause choking."
2,"My puppy does NOT like these! And well, mom doesn't like them either! The smell of garlic is so overpowering, I tossed them a week ago and I can still smell them! I think if your dog likes strong flavors these are for you, but they give my little guy diarrhea!! I would recommend the same brand in the Peanut Butter and Honey flavor, much gentler on tummies and my puppy can't get enough of them."
2,"Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere."
2,"This is not a soup I'd try again.  The sodium content is high - 1130 mg per serving!  The directions call for one sliced onion, but that was not enough in my opinion.  Perhaps they felt the dried onion pieces would suffice, but I am not used to French onion soup with little bits of onion.  Since I had to add the onion, bread, and cheese, next time I'll just make my own soup too."
2,"I got this is a low cost alternative to my normal Jet Fuel and it just didn't measure up. I like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that I just didn't care for. Also, 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why."
2,"It was a surprise to me that she refused the green bits.  Guess she is like her owner my son. He is an Aspie and hates veggies and will not touch anything green. Our dog did not lke this."
2,"I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino).  Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of ""sanding"" sugar."
2,"Maybe it because almonds are my favorite nut, but I didn't notice an abundance of them as other have noted. I guess if you don't like almonds though you probably want to stay away from mixed nuts. The nuts are great tasting, but now they have come off of subscribe and save and are no longer a great deal. Would have given the product five stars, but now it gets 2 because it is cheaper to get at the grocery store now."
2,"What can I compare this to?  I have been drinking daily lattes for 8 years or so made at home, and buying regular at coffee shops for another 10 years before that.  I used to buy beans locally until they changed their bean - didn't tell the customer but I noticed.  Then I tried a lot of different brands and settled on Caffe Appassionato organic espresso beans that I usually ordered on Amazon.  They've been having some issues with (being out of stock) lately, so I thought I'd try this brand to hold me over.  I also had to get some Starbucks from the grocery store because I was totally out.  I thought the Starbucks would be terrible, since almost every latte I get at Starbucks isn't even close to as good as my home-made lattes, but it was not too bad at all.  Maybe I just got a good batch, because in the past when I've tried their beans, I wasn't impressed.  Now for this espresso, which I just opened 10 minutes ago and put into my grinder:<br /><br />The first thing I notice are the beans, which do not look very dark and oily like all the other coffees I've ever used for espresso.  The grind, also, looks more light brown instead of closer to black.  The espresso itself (in steamed whole milk) tastes overly mild with a flavor which I don't know the 'technical' term for, but I just associate with bad small-town 'cappuccino' shops around here (You know, the kind of coffee shops that have tanning salons in them?) - the kind of coffee you order and then sip and then wish you had just gotten regular coffee with cream at the gas station because it's just NOT good.  No wait ... maybe this stuff isn't quite THAT bad, but pretty close.<br /><br />I have my subscribe and save order on the way of my usual coffee, but I am thinking that I might have to go back to the grocery store later today and get the Starbucks to hold me over until Monday or Tuesday when it comes ... not sure I can drink any more of this.  Is it better than nothing?  Yes - I am glad I at least had this to make when I stumbled out to the kitchen after a particularly awful night sleep last night, but just barely.  I'll give it 2 stars - one I'd reserve for something that I'd have to just dump out, take a shower and drive to town for something drinkable.  This is drinkable.  Not sure how it could get so many 5-star reviews, though."
2,"This is definitely a downgrade from the standard chewy chocolate chip cookie.<br /><br />These cookies are supposed to be just like chewy chips ahoy cookies filled with a ""gooey fudgey"" center.  There are three problems: first, the cookies appear a little burned when you open the pack.  Second, there are many more broken cookies than usual.  Finally, the center is not gooey, even at 80 degrees F.<br /><br />In fact, I microwaved a couple of cookies to see what I could do.  Even after just five seconds, the outside disintegrated, but the inside failed to get gooey.  I think there's just too little cookie and the center is too solid - it's about the consistency of the ""stuff"" in the middle of an oreo.<br /><br />Ok, so it can't all be bad, right?  Well, the cookie isn't even as good as regular ones because it's a bit burnt and greasy, and the fudgey bit in the middle is tasty but not really good enough.  The main issue is that the cookie isn't structurally sound enough to stay intact around that ""gooey fudgey"" center, and the middle part isn't better than the cookie it replaces.<br /><br />So I did what anyone would do and took them into work to get rid of them.  They lasted a shade under 4 hours on a floor of 30 people, and there were a lot of small pieces left behind.  I got comments ranging from ""that hit the spot"" through to ""even as free cookies go, I've had much better.""<br /><br />I won't be getting them again."
2,"Not a bad cereal or a bad option, but it's a misnomer/hyperbolic name for a cereal...there aren't many pumpkin seeds or raisins, and the crunch comes from the relatively bland bran. Canceled my S&S immediately; wish I'd tried one box before I sprang for 6."
2,"I'm an avid fan of the B.B. honey sweet mustard and the B.B. hot mustard. I ordered a case of this mustard thinking it would be as great as the others and because we often times mix the honey sweet mustard with cranberry sauce.  Quite honestly, neither my husband nor I care for this product much.  I can't explain exactly why but we just don't care for the taste.  I'm thinking I might use it for marinades and spice it up a bit or use it for glazes.  But as a garnish for meats or veggies it just doesn't make the mustard."
2,"My puppy has eaten three different main dog foods and at least half dozen different treats and this breath NEVER smelled.<br /><br />I transitioned him to Small Breed Puppy<br />Chicken & Oatmeal and after about a week his breath was foul!  My wife won't pick him up any more because of it.  I smell him around his head area and it almost oozes from his pores.  Had his teeth checked and they are fine.<br /><br />I'm dropping the food and looking for something else for small breed puppies.  He also doesn't eat the black bits so that's a waste of money right there."
2,"I bought this to keep my Japanese Spitz occupied, no good. I don't know if it's too difficult for her or if she's just not interested in working that hard for food. She's good for a few minutes then gives up even though she'll get food from it."
2,"Disappointing purchase.  The two packages I opened had all the noodles fell apart into many tiny pieces in the water.  I've bought these noodles before and never had this happen.  I'm guessing this had to do with damage during shipping."
2,"I don't eat anything with cheese and this is no exception. My husband made it for himself, but not without stinking up the entire kitchen with a vile stench. It didn't look much better in the skillet. He ate a plateful, mentioned it was ""alright"" and we threw the rest away. My  husband loves cheese but I could clearly see that even he would not be purchasing this in the future...."
2,"The coffee grounds acquired a funny smell after opening, even though I stored it in a glass jar. I thought the flavor would be interesting and flavorful for coffee drinking, but it is not. I wouldn't repeat purchase. I won't buy flavored coffees from this company again."
2,"I have purchased this flavor and all the other flavors that I was able to find and they were all pretty much a disappointment. When purchasing something called Cherry Blend, I expect that it should have a fair amount of cherries. However, that wasn't the case at all. All the formulas pretty much consist of about 90% or above just apples and very little anything else.<br /><br />If I wanted just apples, then I would purchase just apples but I didn't, I purchased something that claimed to contain more but I don't consider a couple bits of cherries to constitute a product called Cherry Blend."
2,"As far as a pretzel goes, these have the great taste of snyders pretzels, but as far as ""cheddar cheese"" goes there is so little in the sandwich, cant even notice it.  The picture on the front of the bag looks like there is a lot of cheese, but the actual pretzels have a minute amount of filling."
2,"I tried the first sample--carob mint, which sounded delicious but which had absoutely no flavor at all. It was very disappointing. I hope the others are better."
2,"I have had the water before,  in a glass bottle.  I gave as a gift, only to find out the bottles were plastic.  For the price did they have to skimp on packaging."
2,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y2TWQ"">Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Smoked Pig Ears Dog Treats, 24-Pack</a>  I was disappointed in the quality of this product.  The pig ears where supposed to have been ""smoked"" but they have zero smoke smell and almost smell a little on the spoiled side.  The pig ears cost $1.25 each when you buy them in the 24 count bag which is the same price I can buy non-smoked pig ears locally at Petco and Pet Smart.  Also the size of the pig ears are on the small side compared to similar products I have purchased in the past at the same price from other suppliers.  There is nothing really wrong with the product, my Boxer will chew them up regardless.  I guess I was expecting a higher grade pig ear based on the Amazon product description than what I actually received."
2,"Amazon is supposed to be the lowest price, thats why we love it!  As previously stated, $34 at Costco.  Fix it and everyone will buy from here!"
2,"Sadly i got really excited when i saw this and the toy these go into that i bought a few flavors and the toy ASAP. She isnt into them =[ hopefully she comes around and starts to use it but we will see. If she does i will make an update!"
2,"I'm not sure why everyone is so crazy about these. My kid will hardly touch them, and i can't blame him. They taste like styrofoam. Maybe one in five tastes like styrofoam with a slight banana glaze. They do melt nicely in the mouth if you only eat one or two at a time, but if you shove a whole handful into your mouth, they dissolve into some sort of paste-like slag.<br /><br />Everyone's got different taste, and maybe my kid's just a little bit unusual, but these were a total flop. The only use we've gotten at all is using the container like a giant rattle."
2,"The picture at the time of this review is incorrect, so I uploaded my own.  I thought I was ordering watermelon rings, but received the gummy bears. Oh well, it does say BEARS in the description and wasn't worth returning, so I opened one of the bags and tried some. Now I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Immediately they tasted unpleasant, but vaguely familiar. It sounds strange but they taste like sour grass lawn clippings. Okay so I ate weird things as a kid, but now I have a bad aftertaste that won't go away.<br /><br />I guess I'll give them to my neighbor's kids, they should love them."
3,"These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!"
3,"This jerky is very moist, so moist in fact that I might not even call it jerky. It has the texture kind of like those beef-flavored dog treats you get. Flavor is OK, but nothing special. I could almost go so far as to call it ""bland"", but that would only be in comparison to other jerkies I have eaten. I prefer a drier, more flavorful jerky -- the kind you have to chew for a while and exercise your jaw muscles. This jerky requires minimal effort to chew before it disintegrates. I like the organic-ness of it, and the ingredient list is devoid of anything scary. All-in-all, it's decent, but I might not buy this particular flavor again."
3,"I was looking for a white coffee as I had some from malaysia. I could'nt find the same brand so I tried these. Not as good but my wife liked them as well. Not as strong as I like but I will rate them OK."
3,"Kashi's Banana Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar is intended for the health conscious and those who prefer more natural ingredients in their snacks. The bar has great banana and chocolate flavors; however it has the texture of a dry fig newton without the gooey center. The product describes itself as having a banana bread taste. Though Kashi's bar is a fine attempt to replicate banana bread, I would always select real banana bread over this product. It's not that it doesn't do what it's intended to do, but it's hard to get past the bar's dryness and underwhelming texture. Give it a try, but as for me, I'll be walking past Kashi's Snack Bar the next time I see it in the grocery aisle."
3,"I received this item free for review.  I've got shoulder-length curly, frizzy hair.  Color is put on my roots every 3-4 weeks.  When I ordered this, I just hoped for the best regarding healthier hair.  The temps and humidity have been brutal this summer and I have seen some days since using this where my hair wasn't as frizzy.  Is that due to the shampoo and/or the conditioner?  Hard to determine.  Yesterday it was pretty frizzy again.<br /><br />Been using the product for about 2 weeks now.  Something I did notice a couple of days ago, was that there wasn't as much hair on the floor of the shower as I've been seeing for the past couple of years.  Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  It makes sense since this product is supposed to make your scalp healthier.  But slowing down hair loss is not listed as a selling point.<br /><br />The conditioner itself has a silky feel and a light pleasant scent and my hair feels good when getting out of the shower.  Both the shampoo and conditioner can be stood with the opening down, making it quicker to dispense.<br /><br />Two things I need to mention.  The first is that the item came well-wrapped in plastic, and it's a good thing it was.  There was some leakage with the shampoo during shipment.  Not a lot, but it would have messed up everything else in the box.  Probably better to purchase this from a brick and mortar store to avoid possible loss of product.<br /><br />The second is that in order to see a list of ingredients, you are told to pull up part of the label.  What???  Can you see doing this in a store?  Would you purchase one that already had part of the label pulled back?  I think a redesign is in order.<br /><br />On the whole I'm happy with using the product.<br /><br />Amending my review.  I've been using the product for over a month and I'm torn as to what I think of it.  I am definitely experiencing a lot less hair loss since using it, which is a HUGE plus.  However, my hair doesn't look and feel nearly as good and the color is being stripped out of it with each washing.  I think I'm going to have to stop using it.  I've downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3."
3,"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
3,"I thought this would be an interesting combo to introduce to my daughter but I've learned that it's hard to convince an 11-mo to eat curry. She doesn't hate it but I can't get her to eat this like the other flavors. Maybe I'll try again when she's older but for now this is not a hit."
3,"I own three cats and I have been feeding them the ""mack"" for one month. Two of my cats are Siamese mixes and they don't really care for it two much. One is a standard Tabby and he goes crazy for it. They food looks high quality and I don't know why only 1/3 of the cats like it. So I have to only give it three stars..."
3,"If you like chocolate covered raisins, you will like these because that's exactly what they taste like.  They have no huckleberry flavor but are still good.  If you want real huckleberry flavor I would get maybe jam or something."
3,"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet."
3,"There's something off about the pasta. While much closer to the regular pasta than Whole Wheat, which is way to grainy, the pasta here tends to kind of fall apart (only way I can describe it). But from a health aspect its better than normal blue box mac and cheese. And the taste is comparable.<br /><br />I know this sounds horrible and a total waste of cash, but occationally I'll buy this, toss the pasta and replace it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00135XQCK"">Barilla Plus Penna Pasta~2pk~14.5oz Boxes~</a> which is 1000 times tastier than the pasta in this box, suffers none of the high grain of whole wheat, and is chock full of protein and Omega 3's, and overall healthier and more sustaining --  because its got protein.<br /><br />I keep wishing Kraft would just start selling the packets of cheese powder without the pasta (they do actaully <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1T6I"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Topper, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)</a>but its currently more expensive than just buying the box and tossing the pasta)."
3,"the product is wonderful, one of my favorite chocolate treats.<br />but these do not withstand being mailed very well. even though the packaging looked sufficient and the box was intact(not crushed, dented, etc) the bars were pretty mutilated.  made for very messy eating... the caramel was everywhere, instead of contained in the chocolate as it should be :)"
3,"The Flavor does lasts awhile....too bad the gum itself doesn't. It does taste great and you can feel the minty freshness it just doesnt lasts as long as I had thought it would."
3,"I liked the strong aroma of this french roast coffee, both from the pouch and when it was brewing.  But the flavor was off, and it left a strong aftertaste.  I do get heartburn on occasion, and can say I did not have any after drinking this.  However, the price is so very high, and the flavor is only mediocre, so it is hard to recommend this product, unless you absolutely cannot drink regular coffee without distress."
3,"This is the second time i have ordered Moravian cookies through Amazon.com.  The cookies in themselves are delicious, however, most of them are broken because Amazon does not ship them correctly.  I will not order cookies from Amazon.com again."
3,"This worked great to find out if we liked fresh oats rolled with our Schnitzer grain flaker.  The kids love it and eat it almost daily.  The price on the oats are rather high.  I get 25 lb bags from a local natural food dealer that are organic and kosher for around 90 cents per lb.  This is why i say that the cost is high.  However if your'e not a bulk user... then this could fit the bill for you."
3,"Due to nursing a baby with severe food allergies I was on a very restricted diet for about 10 months.  When I found the Enjoy Life brand I was SO excited.  These cookies are just alright.  I prefer the Hard Chocolate Chip Cookies over the Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies (in the Enjoy Life brand).  The taste on these is definately not like a regular chocolate chip cookie, it has a bit of an after taste.  But if you're diet is limited, or you have a gluten, dairy, or other allergy they are a good alternative for a sweet treat.<br /><br />I do LOVE the Enjoy Life chocolate chips, though! They sell these by the bag."
3,"I'm sure some dogs find these treats irresistible.  My dog kind of looked at the ""treats"" as regular dog food.  She isn't impressed and is in no hurry to chow down.  They are good for filling a treat ball though if you don't want it empty in minutes."
3,"Thhis coffee tastes ok but it comes out in a big glob and has to be stirred in. Almost like it is an instant coffee in a K-cup."
3,"We ordered two canisters of Yuban coffee from Amazon which was promptly delivered right to our door step.  The day after receiving it, local stores advertised the same product at a lower price!  However we did save on the gas it required to buy it at the store! But even the price of gas dropped! I was disappointed with the Yuban flavor, but realize to get a higher quality taste you must pay the difference.  We probably will do that after we've consumed the Yuban."
3,"The taste is ok, my son eats it decently.  But when I purchased this I was expecting a chunkier texture, this is still a complete puree."
3,"I went online to find the Zico Passion Fruit coconut water and found that amazon had it for the cheapest price. afte trying the regular, passion fruit and mango I would have to say the regular is my favorite, mango second and the passion fruit last. the passion fruit just didnt taste very good to me and had a defining artificial taste."
3,"Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products."
3,"The flavor is good but this cookie is much too sweet for my taste.  It's  surprising for a French product since I find their pastries to be less  cloying or sugary than American desserts.  The best I can say of these is that they're crunchy...if that's what you're looking for."
3,"I wanted to get this food because the price is more reasonable as compared to my cat's normal food, Science Diet Indoor Formula. I bought a small bag to try it out, and I'm glad I did, because I'm not buying it again for the fact that it makes my cat's poo ridiculously smelly! Even though I clean the litterbox near daily, wipe it down with cleaning wipes, use sanitizing spray on it, and have an air purifier clsoe to it, I can STILL smell when he has gone to the bathroom. The cleaning combination was effective when he was on Science Diet.<br /><br />If it doesn't make your cat's poop smell something fierce, then this is a great deal. The product has good, all natural ingredients, and is inexpensive compared to the other brands."
3,"First off, this soup will fill you up well because of the beans and rice. But I can't get over the sour flavor that<br />this soup has. It has lime in it so I figure that is what I am tasting, but its too much lime flavor and it gets in the way of the spices that are otherwise very good in this soup.<br /><br />Not so sure I'll order this one again but I might try a different flavor from the same company."
3,"I've ordered from this company before and they haven't failed me. Well, I was a bit disappointed in the craftsmanship of the little planter vase it came in. The panda is poorly painted. But all in all, the bamboo is in tact and because of an easy transaction and speedy delivery (faster than usual for regular shipping), I am glad that my friend will have it in time as a Christmas gift."
3,"It is definitely not as good as you can get at some of the coffee shops around here.  I am not convinced that hot chocolate made in this device can be good.  It is drinkable.  It came free with our Keurig."
3,"Where's the chocolate? When I could study the list of ingredients, I couldn't find any cocoa or chocolate. Not bad as a cake icing."
3,"Bought this because I was looking for a great rooibos at a great price.  Turned out to be a good rooibus and about the same price as Twinings, which is also fine."
3,"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item."
3,"I ordered this product online due to high reviews but the taste of the product was not at all what I thought. It is very dense and low on taste."
3,"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time."
3,"Driven by a love for Ethiopia Sidamo coffee beans and a penny pincher attitude instilled by my grandmother, I went searching through Amazon for a cheap alternatives to my local cafe's beans. I can tell you this quest was not successful. I've tried several whole bean coffees from Amazon and every one of them tastes old and stale. If I lived in a location with a poor coffee bean selection I'd still be ordering online, but if you live in Seattle or any other town with fresh beans I'd recommend buying locally."
3,"My son Was born in 05 and we used these bottles...NEVER had ANY problems with leaking or breaking....fast forward to 2011/12 and I refused to use anything else because these worked so well with my son...my baby girl LOVES them and doesn't like any of the wide nipples. These narrow ones she latches to and doesn't refuse. But these newer bottles are nothing like the 05 bottles. They break easily and leak like a faucet. The bigger bottles have a wider opening than the little ones and mixing the nipples makes them leak. My baby dropped hers on the carpet and it shattered like glass. I miss the 05 bottles, wish I never got rid of them. But on a good note, I emailed evenflo and they sent me new ones in the mail, twice."
3,"My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors."
3,"This is a new review - the stuff i ordered last Christmas was WONDERFUL, so I ordered two cans to make catnip toys for the 12 or so cats I know. I opened this up, and my cat who loved the last tin had no reaction. The new stuff has a difference color and appearance. Putting them right next to each other, they only show interest in the old stuff. The catnip toys also have no affect on them, which means I wasted my time making them and there will be a lot of bored cats this year when they open their presents. Rubbing it between my fingers didn't make it fragrant enough for them to care either.<br /><br />I am leaving some out on a little tray for them and I've seen them walk up and munch it a couple of times now over a week, but it's more like when you go browse in the fridge cause you're bored so you put something in your mouth, not eating something because you're hungry and it's really appealing, if you know what I mean. So what I have will last a very very long time, I will probably order it one more time when I run out to see if next year's crop is closer to the original tins I purchased.<br /><br />(note: my MIL claims her cats are into the toys I made them, so I don't know if they aren't as picky as my cats or she said that to spare my feelings)<br /><br />Old Review: When they stopped selling cosmic catnip at Petco I went in search of a new catnip. I have three cats, and one of them is a fiend, the other two don't care so much. We tried one that I ended up finding bugs in several months later :(. I got some of this for my MIL's cats last Christmas, and a tin for us, and the fiend loves it, and one of the cats that only ate catnip if I spent a lot of time smooshing it between my fingers for him to increase the smell actively eats this catnip without me trying to coerce him, so I am really happy and impressed with this brand."
3,"I have been eating Red Vines licorice since I was a little girl.  It has always been my favorite.  I tried these hoping for a more natural option.  They did not live up to my expectations.  The texture is very chewy, more like a gummy than licorice.  I know the flavor also said strawberry, but I was hoping for a little more classic Red Vines flavor.  I will not order them again."
3,"Rcv'd on 20/Nov/06 product w expiry date of 23/Jan/07. Two months is a shorter shelf life than I'd have liked. Is this the nature of the product? Or does AMZN have a slightly older stock than what would be available in retail channels like Costco? I'd appreciate if someone might please inform on the subject. ?<br /><br />.....<br />PS. Cannot really max the stars mainly because the price is to me rather high for a beverage product, albeit an exotic. And anyway too, have not acquired yet a taste for this product. Just as y'all warned. It def ain't a love-at-first-sip."
3,"The chocolate filling inside is a little softer than the chocolate chips which is nice, but the flavor the the entire cookie tastes a bit like preservatives took a strong role in the ingredients. I flavor of the cookie is about the same as a regular Chips Ahoy! cookie. The cookie dough part is softer than standard Chips Ahoy! cookie making slightly better then the crumbly counterparts."
3,"My 18 month old likes them, but he will eat pretty much antying. My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon."
3,"Didn't realize that when my husband ordered this thinking it was a good deal that it is not. I can get an 11 lb bag for this price at several pet stores around town. Twice as expensive."
3,"It's Starbucks.....so you sort of expect strong coffee, but this was even stronger than we thought it would be.  The Pike Roast is much better!!"
3,"I was looking forward to a nice cup of tea early this morning - you know, before it was a hundred degrees out! - so I brewed some of this. It's okay, but the flavor wasn't very strong.  I felt like I was tasting, I don't know, the warmth of the tea more than the peppermint. I brewed a single bag for about 3 minutes in hot water. As I try it other ways I'll update this review. UPDATE: I tried brewing the tea for 5 minutes (the suggested brewing time is 3-5 minutes) and while it tasted a little bit more like peppermint, it still had a weak taste."
3,"After being introduced to these cookies in Ireland in Nov. 2010, I was anxious to find a way of ordering more.  When I found them on Amazon, I was happy, even though they were expensive.  When I received my package, I was disappointed.  The chocolate covering the biscuits had the grey chalky look and when I ate the biscuit it was stale.  I called and they happily sent a replacement...but the replacement was not much better."
3,"I recently had a coupon for the new Uber Larabar and thought I'd try it when it was on display at my local grocery store. Unfortunately, it's not my favorite bar. Flavor-wise it tastes just like the Cherry Pie Lara bar plus a handful of nuts (almonds, pecans, and cashews.  For my taste, I was too sweet, which is strange considering that I was craving a sweet snack and normally sweet is just my thing.  The fat grams (12!!) are just not worth it for me.  I'd rather have a simpler nut bar...or a slice of actual Cherry Cobbler!  Hmmm. bottom line:  If you're a fan of the Cherry Pie Lara Bar and want some added nuts, this will likely be perfect for you."
3,"I FIRST BEGAN BUYING THESE CHIPS WHEN I WAS DATING MY HUSBAND, THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO, WE CAME ACROSS THEM WHEN WE WERE VISITING A MUSEUM, EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN HOCKED, THE CHIPS ARE COLORFUL, AND BURSTING WITH FLAVER, THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IN MY EXPERIENCE IS IT DOESNT MATER WERE I PURCHASED THEM, ABOUT 15%-25% ARE REGULAR SIZED CHIPS, THEN THEY GET SMALLER AND SMALLER FROM THERE, PRETTY SOON I AM LEFT WITH A LARGE PILE OF CRUMBS!!! WHICH YES I EAT, BECASUSE THEY ARE YUMMY, IT SURE IS ANOYING AND FRUSTRATING, BECASUE OF THE AMOUNT OF CRUMBS AND THE SKY HIGH PRICE, {THE MOST EXPENSIVE CHIPS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS.} I TRY NOT TO BUY THEM SO OFTEN ANYMORE, HENCE THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD RATING"
3,"Drank this as beverage through 2/3 of workday for two weeks, pleasant tasting, but didn't lose weight. Did start to feel tired, maybe a caffeine reaction; I've that reaction to coffee. Like all coffee and dark teas, it stains the teeth."
3,"I've been using this brand of soup base for a long time now, actually since it first came out here in Amazon. I even subscribe to this because I use it a lot.  But now the price has gone way up in my opinion.  It used to be just $11.85, but now it's $20 something w/ subscription.  It is now too expensive and I just might have to find a different brand of soup base."
3,"i  brought  this  product  the  price  was  great. it  was  ok  i  did  like  th  taste  of  it.m  i  tryed  it  and  i  made  it  for  my  cousin  she  like  it  so  i  will  buy  it  for  her  and  i  will  get  it  for  her and  i  will  get  it  for  my  neice .  but  not  myself"
3,"Well, the crackers are the same as you get in any package, but this is suppose to be a more convenient, ""fresh""er way of using them. They are wrapped in brown plastic wrap and all the corners are broken, some of the crackers are in pieces. I think there are too many in a pack anyway, 8 crackers is too many to put in a lunch box for a 4 year old. I'd like to see a little sturdier wrapping so the crackers don't break up so easily in the box; and in the lunch box they become a total mess. I'd prefer to buy the regular box of crackers and put the amount I think is right into the divided plastic lunch container I use for his lunches.<br />I even think it's too many for us grownups to enjoy at one time and sort of forces you to eat all 8 crackers in the pack, by suggestion, or risk putting a couple back to get even more broken up.<br />As for the product itself, I love them."
3,"I was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it's nothing special. For my taste, it's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough (even my kids agree). It reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. But if you're more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking."
3,"If I could, I would give this product 3.5 stars.  I do think the flavor is good -- though not exceptional; if you like flavored coffees, you'll probably like this.  The coffee flavor underneath the ""hazelnut creme brulee"" flavor is mild.  The beans are finely ground -- a little more finely than prepackaged beans from Starbucks, for comparison -- which makes this product suitable for drip coffee makers but unsuitable for percolators or any other coffee maker that requires a coarser grind.<br /><br />What prompted me to knock my rating down to 3 stars rather than rounding up to 5 stars is that the packaging is not very good.  How can this be?  There are many, many brands of coffee that use similar, vacuum packed, foil lined bags.  With very rare exceptions, these bags are easy to open without tearing and easy to reseal.  This Melita bag, on the other hand, seemed like it was glued to keep children out.  When I eventually got the glue to give way, the bag ended up with a few large tears around the top, making it difficult to get the beans out of the bag without making a mess."
3,"No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards."
3,"What I bought is not what I got!  I thought I was getting Decaf and it isn't.  The shrink wrap on the outside labeled it as Decaf but it was regular roast coffee!  If you have to drink Decaf, be wary!  Luckily my husband drinks regular coffee and he can use this but I was really disappointed that it wasn't Decaf.  I had one cup and was pretty hopped up.  I can't drink regular coffee because of my thyroid disease so it was a tad unnerving."
3,"These are ok but I'm not sure if I'll get them again. There are other options as far as low carb that seem to be a better snack option. Quality was fine, I was just underwhelmed with the change to a smaller piece size since the last time I ordered."
3,"I would have given this product five stars, but I didn't receive five boxes. We only received four boxes and they were delicious and weren't going to expire until the end of 2011. It was more fresh than cereal you buy at the store. However, contacting Amazon was very inconvenient and took a really long time to get it straightened out because of language barriers. We are trying it again and if we receive all five I'm sure I will give it five stars."
3,"these came perfectly packaged and are beautiful. but are waaayyy too expensive. i thought i would get much more than i did for the price."
3,"This is my first go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036F576I"">Labrada Nutrition Lean Body Ready to Drink, Bananas and Cream, 17-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a>. I've tried Muscle Milk (not the light variety, since it has more carbs) and even the Costco brand protein drink. Save for the Costco stuff, I'm baffled why the recipes for these meal replacement drinks are so freaking sweet. Lookit, I love sucralose (Splenda), and I mean LOVE. I'll add anywhere from 5 to 22 packets of Splenda to my coffee (I hate the taste of coffee). I make sure to keep a giant Costco-size bag of Splenda always in stock at home, and many of my jacket pockets have packets of Splenda stuffed in them in case I go somewhere that doesn't offer it as sweetener. I even have a copy of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W91SZA"">The SPLENDA World of Sweetness: Recipes for Homemade Desserts and Delicious Drinks</a> (gifted because: see above). So yeah, me and Splenda are forever bonded. Given all that, you'd think the sweetness of Labrada's Lean Body RTD Bananas and Cream would be to me what ice is to water, buuuuut no. The sweetness is so overpowering and cloying that I have to water the drink down before consuming it. The bonus of doing of that, though, means my 12 bottles turn into 24, essentially. If I buy the stuff again, it'll be because I didn't have time to go to Costco to get their meal replacement drink."
3,"Although the plain coconut water has a good enough taste, there are additives.  It says with natural flavors.  And, if you read the label, you will see it is from concentrate.  Personally, I prefer 100% pure coconut water.  Nothing else. No additives.  Not from concentrate.  There is no reason for additives.  Also, even though they are recyclable, I do think that there are other brands out there with more earth-friendly packaging.<br /><br />Just this reader's opinion."
3,"Bobs Red Mill Pumkin Seeds came to me in a great box..and inside the box well packaged and extremly secure shelled seeds.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about the quality of the packaging--a really nice thing for me--because it takes some time for me to finish them all--and they stay fresh and secure because of the special care taken in the packaging.<br /><br />The quality of the seeds themselves is very good. They are uniform in appearance...well shaped...appetizing..and healty looking.<br /><br />The price here is totally right for those of us that need more closer to a bulk level of foods. These came in a multipack carton.<br /><br />These are not only items by Bob Red Mills --there are many--and if grains and nuts and seeds are in your diet..your childrens diet or even your pets diet.....then I cannot recommend this line enough to you--for fresh ....healthy eating !<br /><br />Try them !"
3,"Bilberry....it sounded so...so....tasty.  I am sure that this tea is good for your health and for that reason I give it the 3 stars. Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate.  I tried it several times and just could not drink it.  I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste.  Not mine.  I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow!  So, for now, I will have to try something else.  Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?"
3,"We got these to try out sausage making ourselves. The casings were easy to work with, but they were really tough to eat. I'm not sure if this is a characteristic of natural casings in general or just this particular brand."
3,"My dog loves these treats but my vet said they are junk food.  So Louie gets one on special occasions"
3,"Good ingredients, tastes good, but there are about 3-4 little nuggets in the bag.  I was hungry when I bought them; the only halfway nutritious sounding thing in the company vending machine.  I was still almost as hungry afterwards.  The calorie content seemed about right, a little over 100 calories per bag if memory serves, but I was disappointed by how little was in the bag."
3,"this is a great pancake but i expected more of a malted taste and there is none.  i will enjoy the whole order but may not reorder rhis 'MALTED PANCAKE MIX"""
3,"At least they taste like they have some BBQ flavor. Edible, but neither really good nor bad."
3,"The packs are really small. I thought I was saving by buying in bulk, but it was not a lot for the money.  As usually the beef jerkey tastes great."
3,"My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.<br /><br />One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.<br /><br />I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.<br /><br />My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.<br /><br />It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it."
3,"Oddly, the tea bag wrappers are paper instead of the usual foil used for the very same Stash tea when purchased in the supermarket.  We assume that this will have a negative bearing on tea leaf freshness."
3,"This soup's ingredients sound really good but I found that I had to add some salt and a lot of shredded chicken to make it really palatable.  But it's OK for someone who can't have wheat or dairy, which is what I was looking for, for my daughter who has food allergies."
3,"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees."
3,"hello found betetr tasteing popcorn with butter flavor half cost at [...] rojos popcorn kits. when you get them for only 19.00 8oz 24 pack kits they have smaller kits too each and very cheap shipping fast recieveing much better taseing kits i actually fell that im in the threater with these kits and i even ordered 5 boxes more of 24 packs i enjoy them so much"
3,"So my pup is smarter than the average... Pup. And she figured out this thing in less than an hour. I literally had just put it together and gave it to her new and when I got back home an hour later she already had one side out, and was working on the second already. To her credit she didn't need to shred the silicone mold to get the end treat out, but none the less, this shouldn't be bought as a stimulation toy."
3,"***<br /><br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot""; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""citrus, lavender, light smoke"".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />***"
3,"I have noooo idea what the ""blech"" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad. They were not too crunchy either.  In fact they are almost plain regular chips.  No big pizzaz here.  I was sad about that.<br /><br />I was actually really hoping for something limey! And Spicy! But don't expect that here.  I've almost gone through a whole bag, and maybe 1% of the bites have a hint of lime?  Zero bites have had a hint of chili.  99% taste like regular unflavored tortilla chips.  Well...a suuupppper small hint of flavor.  I'm almost wishing I had bought the pico de gallo instead.<br /><br />Basically, if you've been eating any chili-lemon flavored cheetos, completely wipe your memory and expectations- nothing that bold and tangy here.  (Which can be good and bad, my hubby hated the cheetos chili-lemon unspicy flavor and was worried we'd get that here, so he's happy we didn't.  I was looking forward to getting that popping taste, and am sad that wasn't there.)<br /><br />** WARNING: If you've never ordered full size bag of chips from amazon, be warned, 12 bags is A LOT!!! I opened the box and my jaw almost dropped, cause I don't know what I'm going to do with all the bags.  I'm sure they'll disappear at parties though.  (I had ordered mini 2oz bags from Amazon, and with those, the bulk amount is more manageable.)<br /><br />** Also, to make you feel good...I was at Ralphs shopping and one bag of 'Garden of Eaten' chips cost $5.39.  I think it was jalapeno cheese, and that's all they had, but regardless, I felt so good that I got the same thing for about $1.25 a bag (yea Amazon had it on sale). Yippy :-)<br /><br />** Chips were not stale, chipped or smashed on arrival, in case you're wondering.  And expiration date (on my on sale ones) is in about 4 months."
3,"It taste really good, but it doesn't look like in the picture. They are hard. But I would buy it again for the taste."
3,"Nature's Variety Snacks seem to have the right ingredients. My dogs were barely interested in the treats.<br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I've always known that cats need more protein than dogs.<br />Granted this is just a treat but I would think that is why few treats and designed<br />for dogs/cats. I was shocked to realize at the current price these treat cost over $43 per pound.<br />Why not save money and buy your pets Filet mignon or the finest wild Alaskan Salmon.<br />I'm exaggerating of course but I hope you get my point. You could buy a food dehydrator<br />and make your own beef or chicken treats for your pet."
3,"While these raisins are perfectly fine, I don't really detect a big difference between these and the red boxes from the grocery store.  I did think they seemed to have more of a sugar like substance on the outside of the raisin, kind of reminding me of raisins that come in the bran cereal.  My four year old didn't like these, I thought they were okay, and my husband thought they were really good.  They are okay, but I doubt I'll order again."
3,"Item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  Will be included in a wedding favor using the colors of lime green and deep purple.  These were my favorite flavor of Jolly Ranchers."
3,"I love these almonds. They are my favorite to date and I would definitely buy again. The taste is crunchy, they are well toasted and the salt that has been added is just perfect. Not too little, not too much. Best I have ever eaten!!"
3,"complicated to set up, as least for me. it did work once we figured it out. helps to train the dog."
3,"I like this Mio the least of all of the flavors -- to me it has kind of an odd taste.  It's ok, but if you're a real iced tea lover, this probably isn't going to cut it for you!"
3,"This is my first time trying any of Wolfgang Puck soup out.  I gotta say rather salty ..more so than the regular brands I eat. I thought since this was vegetable soup id see big chunks of a variety of veggies. There are hardly a variety of veggies. I would not buy this again."
3,"It has the fattiness but not the flavor of chicken soup. Nothing exciting, but it did have a small positive effect on the mushroom barley soup."
3,"I've a few people refer to this as being strong, but it's not really particularly strong, just bitter. It also seemed to get more bitter as I got to the end of the can. Bitter does not mean strong, it just means it was made from cheap beans and brewed at too high heat. I thought it was drinkable, but it didn't taste like good coffee. It is sweetened, but not enough to counter the bitterness. The can says not to shake, so I was expecting it to have a bit of fizz, but it doesn't. Overall, it is good in a pinch, but I wouldn't want to have it very often."
3,"I prefer the Optimum Power breakfast with blueberries, but the flavor of this version is good, and the texture fine.  My biggest complaint though is the cranberries - they add a nice flavor to the mix, but they're way too hard, feeling like they'll pull my fillings if I chomp at them too much.  Even sitting in milk for a while doesn't soften them much.  It could just be this batch, though.  In any case, pulling the cranberries makes this a less appetizing cereal - not the best they've made."
3,"I'm giving this three stars because it's so low in calories and doesn't cause gastrointestinal effects. It worked fine when I made my own mint chocolate with unsweetened chocolate and mint extract. That tasted good. But, it was terrible when I made chocolate biscotti (Xylitol works fine). I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong ""cotton candy"" aftertaste.<br /><br />The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the ""cotton candy"" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol."
3,"Came quickly.  Boxes were in good shape for gift giving.  Taste of tea is acquired.  A little bit medicinal, but gets better after a few cups!"
3,"The Rum Cake was excellent at first bite but we tired of it quickly. There was no doubt that it is a RUM cake! I think it was a bit overpriced."
3,"I sent to my father as a gift. His comments were it had a lot of flavor but was also fatty."
3,"I have been using regular splenda for awhile now and I like flavored coffee, so I decided to try this product. It packs more of a ""flavor punch"" when I mixed it with another liquid flavored creamer. This product does not leave an after taste."
3,"We got these on clearance in the Amazon warehouse. Came quickly, packaged great.<br /><br />Was I disappointed in them? No. Would I buy them again? No. They were okay, just not great. Kind of bland tasting, not a ton of flavor. I'll probably stick with Ice or Vitamin Water in the future."
3,"I think it is so important to give the best to a baby, toddler to child. It's so much healthier for them in their first years of life. And it doesn't cost much different than the non-organic brands."
3,"I'll be returning this product.  Half the cans were dented and the lables were falling off.  I tried one can that wasn't dented - my dogs were not impressed."
3,"I did my best to give this product a good review, but alas..just can't do it.<br /><br />The containter itself is almost too big, and a bit awkward as well.  Flat on the top and also the bottom makes it a bit clumsy to negotiate.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is nothing special.  In fact, I've tried dozens like it.. nothing that would separate it from any other product.  Decent, but nothing out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Just another shampoo."
3,"In a blind tasting, i doubt i would have pegged this tea as 'blackberry vanilla'. It has some definite caneberry flavor to it, but it's as much raspberry as blackberry. I've not noticed the vanilla.<br /><br />The pyramid-shaped teabags are sorta neat, i guess, but probably not going to impress anyone unless they've been living under a rock for 10 years and you serve your tea in glass mugs.<br /><br />Taste is personal, and some people will like the flavor of this tea more than i did. My major complaint is that each tea bag is basically good for exactly one cup of tea. I drink a lot of herbal teas, and my usual method is to top off the cup with hot water when i gets too cool or too low. Most tea bags, even fruity teas, can make three or four cups worth of tea before the flavor gets too diluted or unrecognizable. With this tea, any blackberry/raspberry flavor is gone in the first cup. The color goes, too. If you drink a cup of this down 2/3 of the way, put the tea bag back in, and refill the mug with water, you'll get a pale, pale pink beverage that tastes light straight rosehips. If the tea had really spectacular flavor of the first go-around, then i'd still recommend it on flavor alone. But for a generic fruity tea, why go with this one when there are plenty of others that taste better and can last a whole morning of idle sipping?"
3,"First of all, let me say that I do not fit the demographic to whom Celsius is hyped...the twenty-something super jock extreme sports person. I am full-figured, approaching geezerdom, and disabled. I have also seen lots of products come and go making wild claims of various miracles. With that in mind, I approached this product a bit more critically.<br /><br />This product reminds me of the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where's the Beef?"" Lots of ""sizzle"" not much ""steak."" From reading some of the other reviews, it seems some believe the acai berry benefits hype, but read on.<br /><br />First, they say, ""Perfect blended flavor of fresh-picked raspberries and acai berries."" Great! I love raspberries, and acai is supposed to be the latest wonder anti-oxidant. OOPS! ""Flavor"" is the operative word here. There are no raspberries nor acai in this beverage, only ""natural flavors."" To boldly hype acai, implying the benefits of it, but only to containing ""natural flavors"" is worth deducting 1 star.<br /><br />""Burns up to 100 calories and more per can."" First, there's the disclaimer ""up to."" More than what? How does it burn calories? Taken as part of a diet and exercise program. Exercise! Well there's a new one. I guess the 200 mg of caffeine would give you an extra boost to allow you to work out longer, but I haven't verified that personally.<br /><br />Yes, Celsius cites six studies ""proving"" it works, but on closer examination, five of the six were done by the same person at the University of Oklahoma, and all were funded by Celsius. All were done using carefully screened college students in their early 20's. I don't automatically discount such studies, and they may be valid, but other independent studies would lend more credibility to their claims.<br /><br />OK, all that aside, how does it taste? One of first things I noticed was the artificial sweetener taste...and aftertaste. Sure enough, it contains sucralose, aka Splenda. The flavor is ok, if you like flavored ice tea. Green tea has such a mild flavor other flavors should dominate. They say, ""We love ginger and hope you do too!  Each Celsius is delicately balanced with a touch of spicy ginger plus all the great health benefits."" While others have discerned a ginger flavor, I don't. Acai? Not sure what it tastes like, but only the raspberry really comes though...along with the aforementioned aftertraste.<br /><br />There is definitely a caffeine ""boost.""<br /><br />Overall, there's not enough for me to like in this product for me to purchase it. My wife and others I have shared this with are similarly underwhelmed. Regular, unflavored, ice tea will continue to be my iced tea of choice. For a caffeine boost, coffee will do."
3,"It's a good bargain for $14 dollars a pound! But it's just your regular old jerky. No taste or anything, just your regular meat--regular jerky, you just get more bang for your buck!"
3,"Better'n Peanut Butter is way too sweet. Not good for diabetics or hypoglycemics. I am hypoglycemic. Not good for people on Nardil meds because of soy flour ingredient which is a high tyramine and I am on Nardil. I had a bad reaction just tasting a tip of teaspoon. It has a nice taste if you like real sweet, but it's a mouth full of sugar. I bought it for low fat but I'll stick with my Smart Balance Omega peanutbutter. If you took out all that sweetness and soy flour I would definitely be your permanent customer. Very rare to find low fat peanutbutter which we all need, but there is always a setback somewhere. I also took a chance buying it being it didn't show any ingredient label."
3,"I never keep milk in my house so I keep powdered milk on hand for cooking and this does the job very well from making bread to soup bases."
3,"I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, ""sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil."" Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil."
3,"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."
3,"I ordered these after trying and liking Health Valley's chocolate toaster tarts and cinnamon danish pastry tarts. Both those other flavors are low fat and all, and are yummy.<br /><br />These strawberry cobbler cereal bars don't taste very much like strawberries and don't have any interesting cobbler flavoring. Very blah, but if you like Nutrigrain cereal bars you might like these ok."
3,"The product was fair, not as ""country"" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store."
3,"Well these Bellyrubs Treats, although a great product, were not a hit with my cats.  Only one of my babies liked them.  She was happy though because she got ALL of them."
3,"I follow a low carb life style and so I do miss having a variety of crunchy things to eat (other than bacon :) ... so I tried this on recommendation from a friend. They are very hard to chew in my opinion and make a bit of a mess when you bite into them as you either have to chew off a hunk to eat or the whole thing crumbles into a mess.<br /><br />And that all would be okay if the flavor was quite so intense. I know Parmesan cheese is a strong cheese flavor naturally but this seems to kick it up a notch. I wanted to use these crisps as a platform for spreads and such but the flavor of the crisp overwhelms anything I would put on it.<br /><br />I won't be buying these again."
3,"The cookie in these is thinner than a regular Oreo and more crunchy. The amount of peanut butter and fudge substance is more than the amount of cookie, which makes the overall product a little too gooey for my taste."
3,"Not enough coffee flavor and definitely to sweet.  It had good flavor, but I am just not used to the amount of sugar it had in it and I add a half cup of regular coffee to it to tone it down.  I wish I had realized that it contained sugar and cream, if I had I think I would have chosen something different and been a lot happier with the purchase.  Kids should love this coffee drink though...."
3,"I know that brown rice takes longer to cook so I was shocked when the box called for letting the rice simmer for 25 minutes.  I let mine simmer for 35 and fixed 2 kiddie plates before I tasted the crunchy mess.  I set the timer for 20 more minutes and put the lid back on..it did soften up a bit but I make my brown rice to be almost as soft as white rice.  Maybe next time I will try making this in my rice cooker since it does a beautiful job on plain brown rice.  The flavor was really good on it though.  Just cooking time was the problem."
3,"I saw this at Marshall's and was curious and finally bought a 4 pack. I managed to drink most of one bottle.  It reminds me of 7 Up but without the lemon-lime flavor. It does not remind me of Sprite for some reason (I like Sprite better than 7 Up, but I'm not crazy about either one). It tastes slighty flowery (but not soapy) and slightly sweet.  It says it is made with sugar, but to me it has that artifical sweetener taste, and it did leave an aftertaste. I would not buy it again, but for what it is, I guess it's okay."
3,"I tried some of this tea yesterday evening.  I have been battling adrenal and hypothyroid problems and getting much better through the use of natural glandulars (Armor thyroid is natural, as is cortef) products and many supplements and healthy life choices in general.  Last night and today, after the tea, I felt awful.  My morning underarm temp had dropped significantly and I just feel cold in general. I have been weak and tired and shaky all day, though at first I did not know why. Should have researched more first, but like most teas oolong tea has flouride and that is bad for a hypothyroid condition.  I can't guarantee the tea is the reason for the downturn, but it is something to think about if you get it and feel the same way. I am giving this product 3 stars because it came quickly, was nicely boxed and tastes fine."
3,"I am not that fond of instant coffee, but I have to admit that this was pretty good. I'm a big fan of anything with pumpkin spice so this was right up my alley. I think the only downside to this coffee is that it's pumpkin flavor was not strong enough. They might have been going for a subtle approach, and maybe that works better for some coffee lovers, but I like strong flavors. Maxwell House always makes good coffee and I think this was worth checking out.<br /><br />I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program."
3,"I tried this product while hiking Mount Whitney - you need good hydration while hiking and the electrolytes are a plus too.  Now I only had one bottle with me on the 20 mile hike so my experience is limited and the weather was perfect for hiking (i.e. not hot but very warm)<br /><br />The following is from the product page:<br /><br />""Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.""<br />- The perfect water has no taste and this had a slight bitter taste<br /><br />""Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.""<br />- On the trail, this water lasted a long time.  Therefore, I must assume that the hydration claim is valid<br /><br />""Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.""<br />-This of course is virtually impossible to evaluate<br /><br />""It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more.""<br />-Again, this is virtually impossible to evaluate.<br /><br />I would guess that if you are just looking for drinking water, this is a waste of money but if you are looking for water to drink while exercising or other physical activity where hydration is very important this might be worth looking into."
3,"I love my Keurig but haven't found my ""perfect"" cup of coffee yet, although this comes close. I prefer a medium brew, not bold or strong. Breakfast in Bed is my choice so far."
3,"I was happy to be able to order this brand of hot sauce that I discovered in Barbados.  However, when the price was calculated, e very high shipping cost did not appear until the very last click. For some reason, I did not see how much it was and I paid $50  for shipping just 3 bottles!  Because of this, I won't be ordering again.  My fault for not triple checking.  The items were as described and were delivered safely, it is just the high cost of shipping that would prevent me from re-ordering."
3,"I bought this tea yesterday, splurging $13.49 at Central Market. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was a big let down. It's not strong or flavorful enough. When I order green matcha tea at the bookstore it is delicious, strong and flavorful.(not sugared up) Wouldn't recommend it. You can buy green tea at Costco that is just as good for a fraction of the price."
3,"I love these things. However, they didn't travel well in the summer months. The candy coating had fallen off. Still tasted good though."
3,"I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy."
3,"These cookie bars are good for a wheat-free alternative, but as far as overall taste goes I can take them or leave them. However, my husband and 3 boys do not go for these at all."
3,"I just received these so-called Cheddar Skinny Sticks, and a lot of reviewers who said that these ""Cheddar"" Skinny Sticks had a mild or non-existent cheddar flavor were right!  However, they were ok (I know this seems contradictory) but needed cheddar flavor (CHEDDAR PLEASE. Or, please, don't misleadingly call it cheddar).<br />  Or, at least enough to justify calling this product ""cheddar"". This snack only has an  extremely barely noticeable (only a slight hint of) cheddar flavor.<br />  The taste was very light/airy- kind of like Corn Flavored Bugles!  That's why I thought that they were ok (per my giving it the 3star 'ok' rating).  And, if you have a taste for a nice corn snack with a, virtually, nonexistent Cheddar flavor, then here they are.<br />  But, most are here looking for Cheddar Flavored Snacks vs others because we want to taste the Cheddar!  So, 2stars off for the makers neglecting this crucial fact. I really wanted to like these- cause, yes, admittedly, I am trying to get skinny and need a good cheddar flavored healthy snack.<br />  How cheap can you be to call something Cheddar, then, when you make it- barely include a cheddar taste within it??  The makers of this product need to SERIOUSLY read the reviews and consider putting some Cheddar Flavor in this product before they can be honest about calling it Cheddar. I'm disappointed- but this makes an ok corn snack.<br />  You want something that, truthfully, advertises itself having a certain flavor and lives up to it:  Like Doritoes or Cheetos? Or, even near that? Then, honestly, you need to keep looking.<br />  I hope that I've been helpful."
3,"I love this coffee BUT the last box I got was some good some very bitter. I love this and have been buying for a long time but the last box was not as good.<br />One day i make a cup and it is so good smells wonderful next day I get a cup that is bitter with very little of the smell I love"
3,"First off, the shipping was great, and Fondarific tastes wonderful. It is also much cheaper than Satin Ice (my personal fave). For some reason I had a lot of trouble with it sticking, and not rolling out properly. This may have been operator error on my part. I have decorated about 30 cakes with fondant, and I have tried Wilton, Satin Ice, and fondarific. I would rate fondarific a tie with Satin Ice on taste, but wouldn't use it to cover a cake again."
3,"We've ordered this pack twice, the first arrived and we were very pleased - enough so to order again.  The second time, however, we were incredibly disappointed to find two dinner packs and no antioxidant pack.  The product was packed/shipped carelessly.  I've had to buy fruit-based baby foods at the market to balance my son's diet, bummer."
3,"I tried the multigrain chips without any dip or cheese.  The flavors were minimally pleasant and reminded me of the chips on airlines flights when the choice is chips or pretzels.  I will not make a point to buy these chips if alternatives are available at similar comparable prices.<br /><br />The best chip currently available is the Lant Chips on your Amazon.com site.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQ58XO"">Original LantChips, Salted, 1.5-Ounce Bag, (Pack of 28)</a>"
3,"The drink definitely wasn't what I expected, but I did enjoy it.  The watermelon and strawberry tastes blend nicely, creating an interesting and very unique taste.  It's slightly carbonated, though I think it could have benefited from slightly more.  As is, it tastes vaguely of soda that is on its way toward being flat.  Had it been slightly more carbonated, it would provide just the right tickle without being as bubbly as soda or energy drinks.<br /><br />It was a lot thicker and more syrupy than I expected.  Pair that with the lack of sufficient carbonation, and you might discover that the drink could be better if mixed with club soda, served very cold.  I was pleased to read that there was no sugar or preservatives added too, but I did expect a slightly less sweet drink.<br /><br />Overall, it's moderately tasty, but there are some areas that could be improved to make this a real treat.  It's not something I could drink on a regular basis, but I might indulge again.<br /><br />6/10"
3,"the only test I know is if my dog will eat both his meals everyday.  if he does and doesnt have watery poop, then the food is good.  the ingredient list isnt the best but its solid.  i may buy another bag."
3,"The candy is great. natural and good flavored.<br />my complaint is the listing of the actual flavors.<br />the flavors received are different from the flavors that amazon lists.<br />i separately bought strawberry candy because the description said no strawberry would be in the assortment, however now i have found there to be strawberry, making the separate purchase unnecessary.<br />and btw amazon allows no returns on any grocery items."
3,"Oddly, the tea bag wrappers are paper instead of the usual foil used for the very same Stash tea when purchased in the supermarket.  We assume that this will have a negative bearing on tea leaf freshness."
3,"I must preface this review with: I am a Gu fan. I've tried so many different brands, flavors, and types of gels/blocks/cubes, whatever, and I love Gu to get the job done. For PowerBar, I've tried the Vanilla, which is really delicious. It tastes like cake frosting! However, the vanilla does not have caffeine, so this does not fill my needs. I have tried the Double Latte, which I abhor--I thought it was AWFUL. It just stuck to my teeth and wouldn't go down, and yuck yuck yuck. I love coffee, too. But as a liquid, in a mug! :) I have heard from many runners that they enjoy the Green Apple, so I might try these in the future. The PowerBar brand is a thinner consistency than Gu or Clif, so sometimes I think it goes down a lot easier, especially if you're not near a water fountain or aid station. If the vanilla had caffeine, I would probably stick with that one. I couldn't run the distances I do without gels. I take one on a daily run of 7-8 miles, I'll take 2 gels on a weekend run of 14-16 miles, and I'll take 3 on a run longer than 20 miles (in addition to Clif Bars). I hope this helps someone make a gel decision!<br /><br />Oh, in addition, I want to point out that PowerBar gels are made in a facility that manufactures dairy products, whereas Gu does not. I hope this helps the allergy sufferers out there!"
3,"This was the flavor most people preferred when I shared these Fruit Thins in the Office and the response was 45% YUCK, 40% GOOD, and 15% Neutral.  The Yuck group complained that the cracker was too dry, fruit tasted like cough syrup, texture was too chewy.  The Good group like that this was at least nutrious compared to similar crackers and tasted like newtons.  I fell into the neutral group and my main opinion is that it is okay, this type of cracker has been done before, some have had baked better versions and the price is quite expensive for a bag of crackers.  One of the more colorful comments is that NEWTON'S are always characterized by a soft fruit filled cake and this product just does not come close to that description hence the comfort food factor which might have made this more acceptable is lost.  Good effort, bad execution."
3,"After eating 5 1/2 of the 8 packs, my little guy developed an allergy to peas!  Nothing major, but ever time he eats peas now his face breaks out in a rash.  I thought children were allergic or not, but this isn't the case..."
3,"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again. As noted the claims of ""no nitrites"" in the description are false: Beef, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy protein, Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed and Soy Oil, Caramel Color), Water, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy and Corn Protein, Salt with Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed, Soybean) added), Dehydrated Garlic, Black Pepper, Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite). Serving size: 1 oz. Calories: 60 From fat: 15 Total fat 1.5g Saturated 0.5 Trans 0 Cholesterol: 20mg, Sodium: 690mg, protein: 14g."
3,"This was a curiousity buy for me while in line for the cashier.  It's not bad, but the taste combined with the light carbination sort of it reminds me of orange flavored alka seltzer plus.  It was brought to my attention that it may taste better if cold from the fridge.  I don't think it would make much difference."
3,"Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking."
3,"Our Bulldog, who destroys everything but the Kong, had the treat out and 3/4 of the way eaten within an hour.  It's a shame... I was really hoping this would keep her occupied for a while.  She still enjoys playing with the empty ball and occasionally I stick a treat in there for her to set another record :)"
3,"This bar product claims to fit in with the 'granola' catagory, and I guess that works, as it's not really a candy bar and it DOES seem to have granola in it. But the nuts overwhelm this, and what you get is a certain weird mishmash of flavors that almost doesn't taste like anything.<br />Now don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, but my first impression was that it wasn't sweetr enough. There's obviously a bit of honey, but it could certainly use more. Failing that, as it probably wants to be on the healithier side (though at 220 calories and 12g fat, it's not) perhaps a bit more of a nuttier taste would be better -- I cannot actually taste any cashews, one of my favorite nuts, and almonds? Forgetaboutit. It's all mishmashed together to give more of a uniform taste, but this gives it no real reason to have the nuts (and thus be more expensive) in the first place, really.<br />So in all, yeah it's ok. But there's a lot better choices out there, both as a yummy-treat snack bar, and as something to give kids to chew on."
3,"This product was disappointing to me because it contained wheat. There were no ingredients on the product details page but I assumed since it was a vegetable dish it would be okay. My son is not specifically allergic but I don't like to give it to him as he spits up more. So, I'll likely not be getting it again. Also, it's extremely bland and not as good as the fresh stuff I make. But in a bind, it's a good meal I guess."
3,"The old saying buyer beware comes to mind as i review this product. while the sweetner itself is a good product, it does not represent the best value for the money. Pay attention to the miniscule contents of each bottle (11.75oz) which when you do the math, its a lot cheaper to buy the Domino 23.5oz at Wal Mart for $6.99 ($5.99 with the $1 coupon on the Domino Web page.) I would not recommend at the price."
3,"This needs to have more interesting spices added to it.  It is an ok base with which to work though."
3,"I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them. This didn't affect my score.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get the right mix it is still organic, free trade coffee and I'll take it any day over the stuff from the big manufacturers. But I was hoping for an easier just-strong-enough experience."
3,"I was looking for a treat to give my chihuahua mix for training. These treats aren't working out too well. They're too big for my dog to easily eat, and really really hard so she has a hard time chewing them. She seems to like the flavor, but I think I'll go back to softer treats that she can quickly consume for training."
3,"I really like the fact that this company wraps their cookies in serving size portions.<br />i wish these had more of an orange flavor to them"
3,"The salt is find, but the package is bad. Unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your salt is all over the floor."
3,"Kellogg's Special K Cereal, Protein Plus, was the perfect cereal before they made some ingredient changes.  They state now on the box ""Now tastes even better!""  WRONG!!!  It was perfect before with less sugar in the ingredients.  This product has lost its distinctive flavor and healthy ingredients by adding 7 grams of sugar to it.  I want the ""old"" better version please.  So disappointed in this new box of cereal.  As soon as I can find a good protein cereal that tastes more NATURAL, I WILL CHANGE."
3,"This bar is super yummy, but I have to agree that falsely advertising it as an almond walnut macadamia bar, when most of the bar is peanuts, is a big turn off!"
3,"The concept of a portable food like this is great.  I think the servings should be closer to one ounce each and I wish they didn't have any added sugar.  Nonetheless a great alternative to some other sugary snack."
3,"This gum has a great flavor, but it doesn't last long (and when I say long I mean more than 2 minutes).  I do like that it is vegan and doesn't animal fats and things of that sort like many other gums do.  I would still buy this because even though it doesn't last long the flavor is tasty and strong for a few seconds then slowly goes away within a couple of minutes.  One other thing I'm not too fond of is it's stickiness.  It has an odd consistancy.  If I try to remove it from my mouth it stays trapped in my teeth and carries a long sting of gum as I pull it away."
3,"The taste was a little dry. It would have been nice if it had some sort of Sugar Free Icing on top. The filling was good. I don't think I would order it again."
3,"This is supposed to be ""Sweet & HOT"" beef jerky.  It's sweet, but it's not HOT.  It's not even hot.  If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT."
3,"I normally do not like ""crunchy"" bars because its a hit and miss proposition. Sometimes too hard, sometimes too soft (feel like Goldilocks). But the taste and texture gets a passing grade from me. Will buy more."
3,"These beans are moist and fragrant, however there is nothing to indicate on the packaging that they are actually organic.  They arrived packaged in a plastic jug with a label indicating they are a product of Madagascar, but nothing about their being organic.  When I pay extra for an ""organic"" product, I expect something to validate that claim.  If they are actually organic, they are obviously not certified organic, so we are just supposed to take their word for it, I guess."
3,"The flavors are good, however, the pops come off the sticks.  Fortunately I know the Heimlich maneuver because my 5 year old was choking on one that came off almost whole."
3,"The batch I received had a rather biting gingery flavor, not mild at all. It did taste good in yoghurt and some other foods, but I wasn't very happy with how it tasted in oatmeal or apples.<br /><br />Update: Since then, I've used Ceylon cinnamon from Penzey's Spices, World Spice and Frontier Co-op. All of them are preferable, and very good."
3,"I bought a single pack of this first to try to see how this can possibly be called 'fresh mango' when it is sitting on a back shelf of a small corner grocery store in our area for i don't know how long. I opened it and tried it and unless we got a dud, real 'Fresh' mango when peeled cut into chunks and pureed will be a bright yellow or bright orange color, not a brownish color which is what this 'fresh' mango puree was. I am a real mango lover and personally feel this color and taste is what an over ripened mango that is going bad will look and taste like. After reading all the reviews i was disappointed, and my baby only had a teaspoon and didn't know any different since it was her first fruit. Also can you really classify something as 'fresh' when it can sit in it's packaging for a whole year? IMO the lure of this and similarly packaged products is basically the design of the packaging and the products easy accessability. As others say you can eat it on the go, while traveling and anywhere basically and the child can hold it, it doesn't create a mess, bpa free packaging easy all around. Other then that once opened it's only good for a day or 2 like a real fresh cut mango is anyway, only its not really 'fresh'..but since here on the northeast mangos only come around a few months out of the year and since most people don't have the time to puree their own fruits and veggies, these types of products are the only alternative, otherwise cubing and pureeing your own mango..now that's fresh mango! Hopefully i can find the time to start pureeing soon. Edit: tried another pouch and it wasn't brown it was more like a bright orange as a mango should be and it did taste good. Convenient to mix as it's texture is smooth but still will try and puree my own when mango season comes around."
3,"These cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet. The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.<br /><br />That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is 170 calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one."
3,"OK - this is not great if you're trying to eat low-carb. The thing is sweetened with Agave, but it's still carbs.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad for a healthier snack. It will never beat a Ring-Ding, but it probably won't kill you as fast. One of my kids likes them, the other doesn't.<br /><br />I think they're OK. They have that weird aftertaste that all soft-bars, like Luna bars, seem to have. There could be a lot more coconut and chocolate for my taste.<br /><br />The nice thing about these puppies is that they are gluten-free for those who care. They are a good size to cram into a bag, though they'll crumble if you push them into a pocket."
3,"Green tea?  Raspberry?  Acai?<br /><br />Sounds innocuous, doesn't it?  Do not be deceived.  This little drink packs an unexpected wallup.  Lots of caffeine and sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose is the same thing as Splenda, and I avoid Splenda (and other artificial sweeteners). So, unfortunately, I won't be a Celsius fan until they switch to a natural sweetener.<br /><br />Which is really, really unfortunate because this is a really, really refreshing drink.  And, yes, I drank the entire can before reading the label.  A case of failing to take my own good advice:  ""Read the label First!""<br /><br />Here's my take on Celsius.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  I am already fond of green tea, and this green tea drink is very tasty. I can easily imagine how good it would be on a hot summer's day in Texas.<br /><br />2.  I have no way of determining whether Celsius lives up to its promise to burn calories, but that's an intriguing thought.  Maybe . . . but its taste is so good that I'd drink it anyway (if it weren't for the sucralose and caffeine).<br /><br />3.  The Raspberry Acai formula has only ten calories.  Who could argue with that?<br /><br />Except for the sucralose.  Except for the caffeine.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Fedex delivered my case of Celsius at 3 pm.  I opened my first can at 5 pm.  And chugged it right down.  And missed my normal good night's sleep.  Be aware that there's a boatload of caffeine in this product. And be a better consumer than I was -- read the label BEFORE you drink.<br /><br />My thoughts?  If you're going to drink this beverage, do so before noon.  Or prepare to stay awake for a looooooong time.<br /><br />2. I don't do sucralose. Whether you call it Splenda or something else, I'm not a fan of drinking chlorine-laced sugar, so that removes Celsius from my list of hot weather treats.  But if it should happen that they replace the sucralose with stevia (and tone down the caffeine), I'll reconsider my decision.<br /><br />Too bad, because Celsius Raspberry Acai is delish.<br /><br />So how do I rate it?<br /><br />Five stars for taste, one star for sucralose and way too much caffeine.  Three stars average."
3,"I ordered this because I love the allstate and it hard I find them.  The product came in an open bag and was not real fresh.  Not horrible but was not as fresh as I would expect.  The pricing was good otherwise."
3,"This is a difficult review to write. Let me start out by saying that I think this is a good product. My cat certainly loves this food very much, and she has been very happy eating it for the past several years.<br /><br />That being said, my 7-year old cat developed feline struvite crystals (bladder stones) while on this food. That does not mean your cat will get them; I am just offering my short story so you can observe your cat, monitor for symptoms and make the best decision on what food to buy.<br /><br />The first time she got bladder stones was over a year ago, and it required expensive surgery to remove them (one stone had broken in half). The question was, why did the stone form in an otherwise healthy cat? I refused to believe it was the food, so I thought she must not be drinking enough water (the vet agreed this was the alternative). Since then she has a pet fountain, and I have added water to her food (making it like an alphabet soup of sorts). She loved it. She would eat all her food, and drink the water to the bottom (because it tastes like this food!). Unfortunately, the problem has returned. If she doesn't pass the stone soon, surgery will be required again. This time, I must take her off this food entirely, not just supplement it with something I think might help.<br /><br />Please monitor your cat for symptoms and pay attention to their needs. I'm sure you already do that since you are reading the reviews for these products. Just my 2c."
3,"This beverage is best enjoyed very cold, or over ice.  Yes, it does taste like coconut water.  If you like coconut water, you would enjoy it.  I like coconut, but not particularly fond of the clear ""water"".  But it does taste quite refreshing on a hot day.  It does bring up fond memories of my life in Hawaii.<br />Nutritionally speaking, it is high in potassium, so it could be used as a sport drink.  Also it only has 60 calories, no fat, and is 11 ounces."
3,"These treats sounded great, but unfortunately my dog doesn't really care for them.  I offered them to my cats and they didn't really want them either.  Maybe my pets are just being picky.  My dog does love Zuke's PB & Blueberry treats though!"
3,"Love the creamer, but several of the units had leaked so I had to wash all the units off and pick through them to throw away the damaged ones.  The shipping box and the creamer packaging box were completely intact so it didn't seem like it had been crushed but maybe the box got dropped or something.  I won't order these again through amazon simply because they seem a little too sensitive to be shipped."
3,"First off I'm very happy that my Keurig Coffeemaker sits nicely atop this storage drawer without having to take up any extra counter space. But on the other hand it's difficult to reach the last K-cup in the very back of the drawer. I can live with it but they should have designed it so the drawer extended out a bit more for easy access."
3,"So far, I have mixed feelings about this product. I don't find that it is overly gritty as some other reviewers have stated. In fact, I've used it on my face a time or two and didn't think it was that harsh. The fragrance is nice but not something I would want to linger and fortunately it doesn't. It does leave you with a clean, refreshing feeling. The chemical ingredients are alarming and for that reason alone, I'm not sure if I would purchase it."
3,"I love how cheap this value pack is!  Even though this tea doesn't seem to help to increase my milk supply, I still like drinking it.  And since I go through a bunch of it, I hated to have to make a trip to the specialty store every week.  With this large shipment amount and low price, I'm very happy!"
3,"The indicated shelf life seems much too short for a dry product.  Either the product is particularly sensitive or I got old stock in my shipment."
3,"While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one."
3,"I couldn't really tell what this would be like based on the description ... I was hoping for a product like trimolene. But it is much more runny than that. I'm not sure what exactly one would use it for- I didn't know what to do with it, and sent it back."
3,"I was really excited to try this brand as I've heard good things about it. I appreciate that all of the ingredients are organic however the overall taste of the product (to me) isn't that great. The chocolate ""flavor"" itself reminds me of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup that you'd put on ice cream.<br /><br />The ""Endangered Species Otter, Smooth Milk Chocolate (48%)"" tastes more dark than this, and much more ""chocolaty""."
3,"Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say ""man I can sure go for some raman"", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars."
3,"I like the taste, but the store does not always has this.  Some-how it tastes different from the one in the store, much weaker caffeine and aroma..."
3,"I've tried several different kinds of energy drink - and can't stand the taste of most of them. This one's not bad.  It's got a bit of a fruit-punchy flavor with only a mildly bitter aftertaste from the energy ingredients.  In fact I like it better than most I've tried, with the exception of the Arizona Az Energy drinks, which are more fruity with less bitter afterwards. It does have a lot of sugar, though: 260 calories from high fructose corn syrup and various fruit juice concentrates.  I'll try anything once, and in a pinch I'd try this one again, but next time I think I'll try the sugar free variety."
3,"I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available."
3,"I am a big fan of the Teavana flavor. They are pricy, but worth it. I've always loved oolong tea. This isn't my favorite. It's a bit strong. I blend it with other flavors and that has worked well. I won't buy it again. But I'll defintely drink up what I have. :)"
3,"While my favorite relaxing tea is called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OF6"">Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime</a> this tea is a close second. This is made with just chamomile flowers for maximum effect. This means that you get a full flavor of chamomile which is delicious with honey. To vary the flavors all you have to do is change the honey flavor. Like maybe use lavender honey or any other favorite honey you can think of. Now if you are trying to get to sleep this tea might help but I would recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OQA"">Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra</a>.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
3,"I usually drink spring water. This one taste like a tap water and I could only drink it when very chilled. The warmer it got the worse it tasted. It is basically tap water purified with added minerals.<br />Due to high ph number it taste very smooth, heavy and thick. It didin't feel refreshing to me at all. It's not the worse I've tried, it beats for instance Las Vegas tap water;)<br /><br />It will be good for someone who prefers this type of water. I don't so this is why only 2 stars."
3,"I'd previously tried Davidson's Earl Grey tea and was pretty happy with it, so I decided to order a different variety.  In retrospect, I think the Earl Grey only works because it's so heavy on the Bergamot.  That hides the fact that the tea itself doesn't have much flavor.  The Keemun has nothing to hide behind, and tastes like nothing much.  Too bad!  What to do with a pound of mediocre tea?"
3,"This product functions as a great supplement to a healthy diet.  There is one catch - finding the appropriate meals to make it a part of.  When added to a cereal mix with milk, it becomes slimy.  When added to oatmeal, product is very noticeable.  Look around for suggestions on how to consume.  The product does have a taste, is noticeable, and does get stuck in your teeth when consumed.  Again, no different than any other potential food additives such as flax seed, but this product is just small enough and hard enough that it is very noticeable when added to any of your foods."
3,"This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips."
3,"I like these Ginger Honey Crystals, and mainly because the beverage they make is ready for consumption as soon as it's cool enough to drink, and doesn't have to be steeped for ten minutes like tea bag ginger tea, and I think it has more ginger in it than ginger tea bag tea, and maybe should have given a four or five star rating, but I wish that it just had honey added, and not sugar."
3,"Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the ""sauce"" and you might have something here."
3,"My dogs can pack on the pounds quickly especially during the winter month so I am always on the look for low calorie alternatives to dog treats that they can enjoy without gaining unwanted weight.  These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats."
3,"When I first brewed the tea bag, I was amazed by the deep red color and invigorating fragrance. The tea was very sweet and I didn't need to add sugar or milk. After taking a few sips however, and relatively enjoying the rasperry taste, the flavors began to become sickeningly sweet--a bit too fruity. There isn't very much ""tea"" flavor here-mostly just fruit flavor. It's worth a try, and I believe that a more experienced tea drinker would appreciate this unique blend."
3,"Well, this product was a great disappointment.  All the fruit kinda tastes the same, except maybe the banana chips.  The fruit is very tart!!  And the pieces of fruit are too small and tend to turn into dust.  Must be a better product out there.  I am on the hunt  --"
3,"Always love the cookies...but they are individually wrapped and that is way too much packaging to be wasting."
3,"I love the taste of these sticks and their high protein content, no issues there. My problem with this product is that it creates, for me, a case of explosive, deadly, gas. And I mean deadly as in clearing the family room during prime time deadly! Not sure if it's the milk content (I am lactose intolerant), or what other ingredient may be causing it, but I now only eat one or two of these a week. Again, could just be me, but wanted to warn others of this benign, but potentially humiliating, side effect."
3,"I'm giving this one three stars mostly because it isn't very salty. This may be fine for a lot of people, but I like just a hint of salt flavor because I tend to eat it with plain rice, not sushi rice. I had a Korean fried, and am forever searching for the kind of seaweed sheets she always had at dinner. They were just a little salty, and tasted fabulous with rice. Guess I'll keep looking. My seven year old, incidentally, liked this stuff and didn't care about the lack of seasoning. He was pretty sad when we ran out."
3,"Who woulda thunk it? I thought this was the same peel back the flap, pour in boiling water, wait and slurp. But no, this version requires a 4 minute turn on your microwave, a kitchen item I do not currently own. So they just arrive and sit taking up spac until I figure out if its okay to just dump in pot and cook slowly for 4 minutes."
3,"I tried my first can of these exact sardines (for about half of what it costs here and purchased at a local deli/bakery store) and I found chunks of sardines not exactly ""packed like sardines"".  These sardines got first class tickets apparently, so they had plenty of room.  Nothing wrong with the taste, but I've had as good or better for less where the can was genuinely packed-to-the-gills with fish."
3,"I Love All BOLD strong coffees.  I thought I'd try this one.  It had a slight Bitter taste to me. Not my favorite. Wish the variety Bold pack wasn't so much $$$!!  I Love that one!"
3,"I like all halo products but this canned cat food is just a little too soupy.  My cats look at me with ""What's this?"" .<br />They like a little something to chew on."
3,"I LOVE the product, BUT, because each packet has a different amount in it, I could not give it 5*. I wrote to the company, & they never replied. It's really a pain in the neck, not knowing how sweet my coffee will be, with each packet. I wish they made it in bulk, so I could use just the right amount each time,...........but, then the company wouldn't make ALL the $$$$$$they do on the small packets. :("
3,"I love the product, they're yummy....however, my baby has choked as well as another friends baby while using these...they tend to break off and don't dissolve too fast. I'm sure when my baby is older they may be ok, but def a choking hazard!!"
3,"It tastes like a decent powdered cappuccino because that's exactly what it is. I noticed the used k-cup was very light compared to the other ones I had brewed, I opened the top and it was empty. There's no actual coffee in this, just instant. I think it's an okay value for the price, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
3,"Unfortunately, it didn't work for me.  I have followed all the instructions correctly and no luck.  I am going to try Nature's Way Fenugreek seed capsules and hope to see good results."
3,"I'm a gum fanatic, but usually I'm used to the sugary versions, or else the very minty alternatives.  I'm trying Spry for the first time, and I think it's a fantastic gum, but I feel the flavor runs out very quickly, and it also comes in very small portions.  The packaging is also frustrating, because I'm used to pushing into the tab for the gum to come out, but the packet that actually holds the gum is small compared to the sleeve, so you have to shake it out."
3,"I love Earth's Best and our son eats almost everything by them. Not their fault that he doesn't seem to like green beans but the consistency is a bit runny for a stage 2 food in my opinion."
3,"If you're not big on taste, this is a pretty inexpensive product. I've tried Myoplex ($60) , ProNos ($50) and finally this stuff. I use a shaker that takes more than 20oz of water, but I used all three in this shaker. The thickest and most palatable was the ProNos it has a very rich flavor.The Myoplex and the Cytosport were on the watery side, very similar, but the Cytosport I liked the least taste-wise.  I also found that the Myo packet had over 40 grams of protein and two scoops of ProNos had the same. The Cytosport has 16 grams of protein per scoop, so you'd have to use three scoops to equal what you'd get in the serving size of the other two. The ProNos comes in a three pound tub and 19 servings per container at over 40 grams of protein.The Cytosport has 209 servings per container (divided by three scoops per 48 grams of protein = 69.6 servings) so you're getting more than three times the protein for about $25 more. Being that you can always add something to the mix better the taste, if you're on a budget, this product is very inexpensive compared to most."
3,"I'm chewing a piece right now for the review. I wish I could give half stars because I think it falls in about 2.5. Its not that its a terrible taste or bad texture, it just is very...blah for spearmint. The spearmint is very subtle. It almost reminds me of a sweet mint wannabe. This is a VERY sweet gum. After chewing for about 5 minutes most of the mint flavor is nearly gone. It has already started to taste bitter. I would suggest Orbit Spearmint and Spearmint Spritzer. I wanted to like Trident because it's the classic gum but it just falls short."
3,"The ones I got were fresh and delivered promptly. The price is a little high though . So price is my only complaint ."
3,"To me, despite the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge hype, these tasted pretty much like any other packaged soft chocolate chip cookie that I've had.  They are small enough that it just takes one bite to eat one.  It's very soft and so is the chocolate fudge in the middle and the chocolate chips.  They tended to already be broken or crumble pretty easily.  The chocolate is very sweet with little cocoa taste and the cookie itself is also very sweet.  You definitely need a glass of milk to go with these.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty basic packaged cookie experience - no surprises or anything special.  My kids of course liked them the most.  I don't think the package lasted more than half a day in our house."
3,"I was expecting more (much more actually) after reading the reviews.  And for the record, I really like coconut.  But maybe it's that I really like REAL coconut.  As for this coffee?  It's okay, that's about the best I can say for it.  Flavor is rather synthetic and seems to vary from pod to pod.  Smell is nice.  It isn't the worst flavored coffee I've ever had, but it ain't a ""contenda"" for a regular spot on my shelf.<br /><br />I love (and drink) many flavored coffees but I can't see going out of my way for this one again...maybe if I find it on clearance or something.<br /><br />Green Mountain's Pumpkin Spice.. now THERE is a flavored coffee (another limited edition) that is superb (and I stock up with half a dozen or so boxes when its available).  This one?  Meh at best."
3,"I went on a limb and tried the Beef and Chicken flavors, boy what a mistake. I was introduced to the original flavor by my Korean GF and was amazed at how much better the quality was over any other ramen I had prior.<br />The discount at Amazon was such I decided to purchase the other two flavors above. The noodles are still great quality but the flavoring is horrid. I've since given the entire boxes to a friend that will eat anything. Even he commented the flavor wasn't great.<br />Stick with the original and you'll be much better off. At least that is my opinion."
3,"I like the taste of Twizzlers...and well, this was a totally different taste<br />but being attached to an Aussie, lol I wanted to try his flavors etc. The black is better in this...this came fresh and its ok-just a different taste than what we get over here.  You may like it-just wasn't what I was expecting."
3,"I love Genmai at my favorite Japanese Restaurant with its great aroma and strong taste.  Choice has a fair aroma but is weak brewed at 8oz as they suggest.  I need to back it down to the standard 6oz cup to make it enjoyable.  I like Choice teas and wish I could love this one.  I will keep buying it On-Sale and brew at 6oz.  Otherwise I buy an upscale brand."
3,"These are very convenient and require no refrigeration its texture is simalar to applesauce, and it taste fine. My lil one is not terribly in love with it but she tolerates it. I like thats it healthy and relatively mess free-which is awesome for kiddos that like to feed there self. You can try it cool or warm. Main negative would be that its a little pricey."
3,"Aside from being hard to find, Mrs Renfro messed up a good thing. Reminds me of the Coke recipe change years ago.<br />Why change the best pickled jalapenos on the market. I loved them the way they were. About 2 years ago they became impossible for me to find even on their own website. Then when I find found some to order and had them shipped to me, the label was different and so were the peppers. They are now smaller and less mature and they have also removed natures handle (the stem) from them. Maybe they had to change suppliers, don't know.<br />I have been giving away the jars I received and now gone back to buying Trappey's, next best thing. I hope they go back to the original like Coke did. I'm guessing their sales are off but are stuck in a contract.<br /><br />I loved the flavor and texture the way they were. Now I buy others."
3,"I like that these are organic and don't have corn syrup.  My kids and I both like them.  I'd give them 5 stars but I noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe.  The crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily.  And if you have kids under 5, you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be.  The taste is still great, but I preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them.  And when you order these in the mail, like I did last time, don't expect many full graham cracker sheets - most are already broken in two, and quite a few are broken at the edges as well."
3,"I really wanted to like this cake mix, particularly since I had to buy it in bulk to get it, but it has an odd taste to it.  The sweetness of the product is not your typical sugar sweet.  I suspect it comes from a fruit juice based sweetener that they use.  I can't honestly recommend this over other cake mixes out there.  There are better choices."
3,"I eat several varieties of the Think Thin bars, and they are a good, low carb snack.  This particular variety, while VERY tasty (not to mention a higher fiber count than the other varieties), is not sugar-free...it contains honey.  For anyone NOT doing a low carb diet, this may not be an issue; however, for low-carbers out there, you know that the carb count alone isn't enough.  You have to read the ingredients.  I was sooooo disappointed to see honey on the list.<br /><br />Oh, well...it was a nice, one-time indulgence."
3,"And Dutch I am,the double salty ""Dropjes"" is like taking a sip of the North sea,there was enough in the shipment for me to hide some in every crook&cranny in my house,car and in a special box to keep in my pocket at all times.<br /><br />Try it,you might like it."
3,"This is a great grain free, alternate protein dog food.  We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.<br /><br />In one month (Aug-September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non-math people that's a 30% increase).<br /><br />This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un-economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result."
3,"tastes great, but too much fat like all the other dumbo brands.<br />suzie was much better than this - the flatbreads are so low fat.<br />why not make this also low fat?"
3,"I love this product and order it frequently.  Usually it arrives in a timely manner and in good condition.  When I opened this last shipment I found some hemp seed scattered throughout the box.  I carefully removed the first of two pouches and found a 1"" rip in the middle of the front of the bag.  Most of the product was still in the pouch and appeared fresh and undamaged so I transferred it to a container.  The other pouch was intact.  I hope this is a one-time occurrence, and I will be ordering this again when I need more.  More care needs to be taken to assure that the pouches are handled properly and that they are all in good condition when packed."
3,"I had trouble baking the bread where it would be done in the middle.  It was very doughy.....  Baked it 120 minutes instead of 70?  Then it was very crusty around the edges."
3,"The leaves are chopped to tiny pieces. Otherwise I would have enjoyed it much more.<br />I had to buy a tea leaf separator/container to avoid the trouble of drinking those small pieces."
3,"I've never been a fan of instant coffee, but after trying Starbucks ""via"" I thought the industry had made some major advances in taste!  Alas, it appears that it's really just Starbucks that has figured out how to do instant coffee a better way, while everyone else continues with mediocre product.  I was hoping that this would be an organic and less expensive alternative to Starbucks via -- and now have 97 more cups of this coffee to make before I can get back to what I really like!  I don't know what process Sbucks uses or why the other companies can't follow suit, but there is a world of difference.  This Mount Hagen instant decaf tastes marginally better than Folgers or whatever other instant brand you'd buy in a jar -- but it's bitter and has a sharp sweet taste that does not appeal to me.  No body whatsoever.  They say that they use 100% Arabica beans, just like Sbucks, so it must be something to do with the processing.<br /><br />Maybe I will find some other use for all this coffee -- folded into a cake or milkshake or something it might not be too bad?!?  But I don't really see myself enjoying this every morning -- it just makes me crave the good stuff all the more."
3,"Atkins Baking Mix is just okay. My family didn't mind it but I thought it had a strange taste.<br />I will use it up but I don't think I will buy it again."
3,"Just bought a bunch of this last month. This was our introduction to coconut cream (milk) powder to be used as an alternative to milk. Very Yummy. We will be making the switch. However, the low star rating comes from the fact that Chao Thai Brand powder (Manufactured by Korn Thai Co, LTD) has added sugar in the form of glucose syrup! According to the nutrition facts this addition adds 5 g of sugar for every 30 g serving size. I know that glucose is different than regular sugar, but for us, any added sweetener is unnecessary. Because of this discovery we are looking for a no sugar brand.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients as stated on the box:<br /><br />Fresh coconut cream - 85.20%<br />Glucose Syrup - 11.8%<br />Sodium Caseinate (Milk Protein) 2.0%<br />Silicon Dioxide - .5%<br />Dipotassium Phosphate - .5%<br /><br />That being said, if you are looking to try coconut cream powder and you do not mind the sugar this is a great product to try! We did not find any problems with grittiness, or clumping - just a smooth drink with a hint of coconut taste(not overpowering or overly tropical which concerned us). We just added the powder to hot water like we were making a cup of hot tea and then drank when cool enough. We used 1/3 cup of powder in 2 cups of water for a light drink and 1/3 cup of powder in 1 cup of water for adding to curries and other foods."
3,"Our pediatrician recommended switching formula to Nutramigen because switching to Soy did not seem to help my son's atopic eczema. Compared to standard Enfamil Lipil or Similac Soy it seems to cause more spit ups even though the claim is that Nutramigen is supposed to help with spit ups. Currently the only thing that is working for my son is Aquaphor moisturizing cream regardless of the formula. On the plus side, my son has not rejected this (or any of Enfamil Lipil or Similac Soy) formula outright. I'll update this posting if the pediatrician has a different observation."
3,"The honey is great, however, the packaging was a sticky mess.  As far as I can tell, the hot weather caused the honey to expand and it leaked thru the packaging.  It was the inside packaging, not the bubble wrap and box the product was shipped in.  The honey company did not stand my their packaging when contacted.  They stated it was Amazon's problem.  Not so.  Never was resolved.  Therefore, I'm only giving it 3 stars."
3,"I actually ordered a black mango peach tea .... havent tasted this one - im hoping its fine - its not worth it to send it back - i am still wanting the peach mango black tea....."
3,"Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.<br /><br />This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size."
3,"Biscuit and DJ obviously love the taste of this dog food.  They don't leave a drop in their bowls and gobble it quickly. In fact they would eat themselves sick!  They don't know when to quit with this food.  Chef Michael has definitely created a tasty meal.  I'm not that thrilled with the ingredients.  The first ingredient is beef and that is good, but too much grain after that.  I prefer more meat and less grain.  But, as for the taste, like I said my dogs can't get enough of it.  I don't think I will buy this as their regular kibble, but definitely for an afternoon treat."
3,"I was a little disappointed in this product.  The cookies are heavy.  The taste is fine, but the heaviness got to me.  I have to admit, I am very picky about cookies.  It is hard to find good, natural cookies.  I would recommend trying these, but I prefer other brands."
3,"Good News: The caviar is de-lish and it was a 12 oz. jar (not 10 oz.). A rich texture and bright taste. Bad News: I was quite disappointed at the $16+ shipping charge for 3-5 day very which I think is quite excessive. The shipping cost was more than the item."
3,"I bought this tea because i have used st.johns wort in tincture form and know that it works. This tea does work for depression and a general blue feeling...but it does not taste good. I love drinking tea; most of what I drink is tea and I drink a multitude of different types from matcha, chai, red zinger, etc, But this tea just taste god awful. It isn't vomit inducing awful (excuse the mental picture) but it is not pleasant at all. This doesn't mean someone else won't like it, but I don't. Someone said it taste like black licorice, and that may be, but I couldn't say as I have never had black licorice. I don't like licorice of any kind though, so it probably does taste like that. At any rate, I would recommend buying 1 box first, just in case."
3,"This is a great grain free, alternate protein dog food.  We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.<br /><br />In one month (Aug-September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non-math people that's a 30% increase).<br /><br />This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un-economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result."
3,"It arrived cold and fresh in Ca. It was derinded so it was easiy to cut. It cooked well and smelled wonderful. But, It was 20% too salty for my taste. The bacon was edible and was a good component for dishes,but so salty I couldn't eat more than 1 piece at a sitting. I will not order this brand again."
3,"These granola bars are very similar to the Nature's Valley brand bars.  The Clif Crunch Bars are very messy.  They crumble.  The flavor is not as good as the flavors offered by Nature's Valley."
3,"I like the fact that this tea is organic, but compared to the taste of Ito-en's Oolong shots (which are not organic, unfortunately), the Anteadote teas lack a freshness and purity that the Ito-en has. Too bad. I'd like to have organic + great tasting tea with no sugar. Will keep looking."
3,"Amazing to find these online - This is the best potato chip flavor on the planet, and I haven't been able to buy them since leaving texas... however they are expensive, and were shipped in a crappy box which was squashed en-route... 12 of the bags were popped when the box arrived... sigh..."
3,"This was a very convenient option but I found a better price at the local grocery store. The applesauce arrived quickly, was packed well"
3,"The litter is great -- clumps well, keeps smell down, the cats are happy with it. However, one of my cat's is a litter kicker and so it is everywhere (all over the house).  I have tile on the floor the litter box is on and the little granules (like sand but a little bigger) get into the grout and have eventually worn some of the more traveled areas down (some of the grouting is almost gone).  I've used Swheat Scoop about a year and half.  I sweep regularly but as I said, my cat is a kicker.  The other cat is just a magnet for any litter and carries it everywhere.  Ever have cat litter in your bed?  Yeah, you will if you use this.  I have mats and take all the precautions possible but it still happens.<br />I still buy it because it works but I'm looking for other alternatives for the sake of my floors."
3,"And on top of being expensive here you also have to pay shipping.<br /><br />Not worth it.<br /><br />Now if they were MEGA-STUFFED at this price they would be worth it, but even those I can get locally for $2 box and $1 when on sale."
3,"I typically feed them dry food, and once a day I split a can of Fancy Feast to give them a treat with their supper.<br />They love it. They have never turned down any canned cat food. Sometimes one will refuse or just nibble at a particular flavor, but they usually like their canned food<br /><br />I tried out both flavors on my three kitties, None of them did more than nibble, I tried it on my dog, just out of curiosity, He ate it . Continuing my experiment, I went to my friend Margie's house. She has three cats as well. Much like my feline family, one is a senior and two are young. Sadly, I had the same result. None of them liked it.<br /><br />Before receiving the food I looked online to learn as much as I could about this food before subjecting my furkids to it. Everything looked good, safe and worthy of Morgan, Rosie and Emmie. I was quite disappointed that they don't like it, to tell you the truth. It looked so good that I really wanted them to like it.I will be dropping off the rest of it at the shelter tomorrow. I certainly do not want it to go to waste, as it is a good quality product."
3,"The coffee was send quickly. It was satisfactory but not as good as other Mocha Java coffees I've tasted (perhaps because I now have to stick to decafe). The company sent a sample of decafe Costa Rican coffee which was very good."
3,"This product was not as flavorful as I had expected.  The only flavors of the variety pack that I really liked were the jalepeno and the honey mustard and onion.  Two flavors I would not ordinarily enjoy. For the cost, I would not purchase again."
3,"I have bought ReBars by the box for years, but I regret my last purchase because they have changed the ingredients, and the bars are much sweeter.  My son (age 8) will no longer eat them.  I recommend buying a single bar from your local health food store to try out the new recipe before ordering a box."
3,"I bought the Sodastream after just looking at it for a while.  Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking ""fizzies"" many years ago and was shooting for that effect.  Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it."
3,"I drink a strong black cup most mornings, thought I'd give Jet Fuel a try.  One thing is this is a strong cup of coffee.  It may be too much for me since I drink it black.  The first thing I noticed when I pulled one of the K cups off the brewer is that there wasn't an aroma like I was used to with other K cups, which translated to little smell in the cup.  The flavor is strong and bitter, like I say it wakes you up.  Not one to sit and enjoy in my mind.  I prefer the other bold coffees available in K cups to this one.  They at least have an aroma and taste of coffe vs. this one that has bitterness to offer."
3,"This is a nice looking box but is too tiny, palm size (woman's palm).  It fits only a few candies."
3,"I think these are a great idea - hiding pills inside a tasty little ball of gooey chicken tasting stuff.  Because I could get them with free shipping via Amazon's Supersaver shipping (for orders over $25) I decided to try them.  We have two indoor house cats and two outdoor barn cats, and I worm them quarterly.  Usually I have to grind up their pills and hide the powder in wet food.  I tried liquid wormer but they could smell it in the food and wouldn't eat it.<br /><br />So, the Greenies arrived and I fixed one for each cat.  One cat smelled it a long time, but wouldn't eat it despite my pleading.  Two of them gave the Greenie a quick sniff and backed away after giving me a dirty look.  The fourth cat actually hissed at me when I offered it to her.  She's not the friendliest cat to begin with, but she usually takes treats from my hand.  The overall opinion from the cats seems to be ""yeah, right!  Nice try!""<br /><br />Maybe the salmon flavor would be a better choice, but I don't think I'll spend the money to find out.  I'm giving three stars because it's a great idea, but if the cats won't eat them I'm back to the drawing board."
3,"I thought this was great, my dog is afraid of it. It's made of hard plastic and my wimpy dog was afraid of it as soon as it turned over once against the floor. I've tried wrapping it with rubber bands to soften the roll but too little too late!<br /><br />Update... my dog's older brother loves it! He's a little bigger and is a total food whore so I thought he'd like it. He's just visiting but I'm sending it home with him and I think it's finally gonna get some great use!"
3,"My dogs love these, but they definitely are smaller than I'd hoped.  I have a pair of 2 month old lab/pit mix girls, entering a teething stage. As such, I wanted a harder treat for them.  They absolutely love the flavor and texture, but I worry about them choking, as they're really quite small (maybe 3 inches long).  As such, I'm giving them to my pups far more frequently than I'd hoped - I don't dare give them these treats once they get even a bit larger.  I don't regret the purchase, as they definitely are an enjoyable treat, as displayed by how quickly they get demolished.  However, I really wish there was a breed sizing advisement in the product's description.<br /><br />In short - great product, but not for anything by smaller breed dogs."
3,"I purchased these treats on Amazon thinking they would be like the chocolate covered pomegranate seeds at Trader Joe's, but unfortunately they are not. While they are quite tasty (yes, I will be finishing the bag!), the expectation was that there was actually going to be pomegranate as the main ingredient. The name is misleading and, like many food companies, this seller is jumping on the bandwagon of adding the smallest amount of the fruit in the mix and using its name in the title. The pomegranate juice concentrate is mixed with several other fruit juices, and there is no indication on the package of how much pomegranate is actually in there. Trader Joe's version is actual pomegranate arils covered in a small amount of chocolate - definitely could qualify as a ""healthier"" treat option. These, unfortunately, do not. Quite tasty, but don't kid yourself on any health benefits here - too much sugar! FYI: 180 calories and 26 grams of sugar in ¼ cup (about 16-20 nuggets)."
3,"I LOVE these bars! They marry salty + sweet and PB + chocolate. However, I was really dissppointed to read the ingredient label and dsicover that they do contain milk powder and are NOT dairy free as advertized. If you don't care, definitely buy these. But if you have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy, you should know these contain milk."
3,"It is marked as a 24 count on the web page, but when I recieved my order the box is only a 12 count.... makes the variety twice the cost as the individual flavors.  I love the product, just think Amazon should take the 24 count expectation off if they are only going to send one box."
3,"I orignally purchased the apple Buddy Fruits bites and they were great--my kids loved them. I decided to try something different and purchased the raspberry and I found them rather unappetizing. First, they are very dark in color, they're actually black, and the taste is really strong. To me they tasted just like very concentrated raisins. The odd thing is, while I found them loathesome, my kids thought they were pretty good (ages 3 and 1). So if your kids aren't too picky they might like them, but if you dislike brushing black goo out of their teeth go for the apple ones."
3,"I wanted beans.  I had some backup Yuban for when I run our of beans so I had something to compare this to.  I think they are both about the same, ok for pre-ground. The Yuban was $8 for 2 lbs so I'd prefer Yuban to this.  I think I like the Yuban a little better(my taste) both don't come close to fresh beans. 8 o'clock beans are much better.<br />This stuff is ok but not worth the money, imo."
3,"One of the cans arrived damaged with a collection of bugs in it.  The product itself is fine in the other cans, and I am using the rest.  My cats really like this food and I have ordered it before with no smashed cans.  I hope the company is not foisting old product on online shoppers."
3,"My dog sometimes eats this and sometimes walks away. What can I say...looks good to me, but hes the dog."
3,"With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.<br />The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short."
3,"This cereal doesn't taste very good, and it turns to mush the moment my almond milk touches it.  However, it is the only cereal I can eat on my low carb diet - and sometimes I just need to eat cereal."
3,"I give this 3 stars because it wasn't unpleasant coffee.  It just didn't taste like anything.  It reminded me of hot water with those Folgers coffee bags dunked in it for a little bit.  I don't like too strong a coffee but this was way underpowered for coffee.  I enjoy the bolder coffees, too, such as Coffee People Organic Bold and Dark Magic.  I would not buy Nantucket again."
3,"I liked the initial crunch, similar to Honey Bunches of Oats or Frosted Flakes but more sugar coating.  Then after the taste settled in there was a burnt taste that I couldn't quite identify.  It seemed like molasses to me but my son said it tasted like burnt caramels.  I would agree with that.  It was good cereal, not great...It was just too sugary for me.  I never did get the peanut taste unless it was the burnt peanut oil taste that we were mistaking for molasses/caramels.  There was just a weird aftertaste that nobody in the family could identify.  I wouldn't purchase again.  It was OK. Not worth the price nor calories from all the added sugar."
3,"5 stars for taste, 1 star for the trans fat content.<br /><br />These are one of the best tasting, addictive snacks I've ever had, but it's a good thing they're not easily available. Their trans fat content is surprising and disappointing; it makes this snack a treat to be enjoyed only very occasionally. I look forward to them, hopefully, adjusting the recipe to eliminate the trans fats."
3,"the box is really deep so bags are a pain to find but you will like the box nice way to shift and to scoop"
3,"fine for me but 4 year old nephew prefers liquid ""premade."" dissolves okay but there are a few other better products out there."
3,"I wanted to really like this cereal.  We are big into old fashioned oatmeal for breakfast, as well as cooking with oats, in cookies and breads.  A ready-to-serve oat cereal, with enough actual oats in it to count, would be nice.  Unfortunately, we are underwhelmed by this product.  It has an unappetizing rather gray color.  The texture is a bit ""off"".  And the taste is bland... VERY bland.  The cinnamon is almost unrecognizable.  For the amount of sugar in it, it's not very sweet tasting.  In general, we don't really care for it much.  Sounds good, but we'll stick to oatmeal...."
3,"It's very hard to do green tea in a bag.  Green tea is so much less forgiving than black tea, breaking it up and putting it in a bag makes it so much harder to brew a good cup that isn't bitter.  On that note, I must give this product credit.  This tea brewed with no hint of bitterness (using a cooler temperature, as one would do for other green teas).  That said, this tea does have quite a strong lemongrass-lemon flavor, and that gives these tea bags some latitude.  I tasted much more citrus than I did green tea.  That's not necessarily bad, if that's what one wants.  The main issue I see is that this tea is marketed as straight green tea, when it's really a flavored product, first and foremost.  As flavored green tea in a teabag goes, this is okay, but it's not the best I've had."
3,"i drink my coffee strong and black so this is too weak for me.  i do have the one pot coffee maker and i either have to decrease the water or use two of these.  this is not economical.  it is much easier to just wrap some french roast coffee into a paper towel and use that instead.  if you like very mild coffee pods, this i s fine, but not for those of us who can't get it strong enough."
3,"Used with the right cup setting, this is a pretty tasty drink. It does have a hint of coffee flavor, but my thinking is this was designed for people who are not ""coffee people"" to be able to enjoy a richly flavored ""coffee"" in the Keurig brewer. I got a Keurig to curb my Starbucks habit, and have to admit this k cup is not an even trade. I suggest, if you have bought these and dislike them, to brew a small cup of another regular coffee k cup and add this to it. If you are looking for a rich coffee with a mocha flavor, this is not it. But it is an enjoyable warm drink with coffee and chocolate flavor."
3,"I am still experimenting with the best mix for me, but so far, the milk is too overwhelming for a person in me that likes his chocolate/cereal/etc. with his milk rather than the other way around.  In other words, I'm tasting too much of the milk and it's not a taste I care for.  It is better than the cheap stuff like store brand or Swiss, etc. but I would much rather use it in my espresso machine than boil off milk (will be one of my next experiments).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Very good chocolate.  I have used the straight cooking based Ghiradelli cocoa and it is intense, but good actually in an espresso type situation.  I'm thinking this stuff should be a bit less intense than the cocoa made for cooking and be even better for my personal purpose with it.<br /><br />-Beats the store brand or use with water stuff if you either have the mix down or do not mind the extra milky taste.<br /><br />-Even though milk has to be used and milk does cost more than free water, the chocolate is not only worth it but cost to cost, the intensity level of Ghiradelli vs. Swiss or other is a lot higher.  In other words, while Swiss may be cheaper on paper, it will take a TON more to get to the same intensity level as Ghiradelli AND it will not taste as good.  So the having to buy milk is really the only additional cost factor going on here.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-I have yet to figure out a good enough potion that makes the taste less milky.  If I cannot figure one out, I will have to downgrade this review for the product being of use for only specific people or applications.<br /><br />-Have to buy milk and with such a nice chocolate, I'd recommend an organic or nice albeit expensive milk.  I will update this review if I find that using water/espresso machine/etc. factors can take the a good bit of milk out of the equation.<br /><br />So there you have it.  More pros than cons from me, though I am only partially satisfied at this point.  Will update if I can figure out how to nail down better solutions to my liking, and if anything, I can always use it how I did with the Ghiradelli type made for cooking!  Afterall, I bought this hoping it would make good hot cocoa, but knowing it would be top quality chocolate that I could at least toss into my espresso mixes if it didn't work out."
3,"I was hoping the Timothy French Roast K-cups would be as good as the Tully's French Roast K-cups; but, in my opinion it is not.  The Tully's FR is much bolder and more flavorful.  I have a standing order for the Timothy FR that I am going to cancel."
3,"These 100 Calorie bars look way better in the photo than they taste.<br />They are not horrible - just not what I was hoping for."
3,"The product is obviously great quality but considering that I was purchasing a ""GIFT BASKET"", I find it odd that there was no basket once I received the items. So on top of paying the expensive amount on the ""gift basket"", I had to go out and purchase a basket! Change the title of the product please...it's extremely misleading."
3,"I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed."
3,"I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />In this case, with ""Breakfast in Bed"", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered.  ""Breakfast in Bed"" is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild, but not very memorable flavor.  On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.<br /><br />A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC"">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.<br /><br />ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K"">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a><br /><br />ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM"">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing)."
3,"I was excited about this product when I read the reviews, but I am a little disappointed in it.  I didn't notice any difference or firming under my eyes.  I have used other under eye creams that have been equal or better than this product.  It is a nice thick cream and the 1oz bottle will certainly last a long time.  I am not crazy about the scent, but no one would ever smell it on your face.  I will definitely use it up, but I won't buy again."
3,"After reading the reviews I was itching to get my hands on these as the ones I had<br />were a couple of years old but kept sealed, so they were OK.<br />If you keep Pistachios sealed they last a very, very long time.<br />The new Pistachios did not taste much better than my two year old ones.<br />Nuff said"
3,"My dog LOVES to chew her toys, and I thought that with the advertising that the bottle was ""bullet-proof"" that meant they had made the rest of it as indestructible as they could.  I would have been happy to get a week's play out of this.  No go.<br /><br />My dog loved the treat aspect of this toy.  She spent a long time working the treats out one by one, and I was really happy with how busy it kept her.<br /><br />Until I went to pick it up to bring it inside with us at night.  I found several little pieces of the rope part that she had torn off.  I realize it's difficult to make a toy unchewable, but this wasn't even close to as durable as it could be.<br /><br />For a dog that doesn't try to destroy toys, this would be a wonderful toy!"
3,"I liked this gum but the flavor didnt last as long as I thought it would"
3,"Dash loves it. Jasper does not. Dash Hoovered both his bowl and Jasper's, while Jasper took two bites and then moved over to the kibble bowl. We've tried three different flavors so far, and the verdict has been the same. So safe to say, not ALL cats want to eat ""people food."" I don't know much about this product except what's on the label. The fact that it's a product of Thailand concerns me a bit -- I don't know what their standards are for pet food, and after the scandal with the lead in Chinese-manufactured toys, well, I'm a little skeptical. It's also an expensive product. Since I don't have a consensus among the house felines, I doubt I will purchase any more of this product."
3,"I was a bit concerned as the jerky had an odd odor not present in canine caviar products I had bought before, but they looked fine and my dog enjoyed them, so maybe it was just because they had been packed in an airtight package for shipping.  This product is WAY too expensive, but my dog really enjoys it."
3,"It did have a fudge center but it was too much chocolate and not enough cookie,  and the cookie was all damp and soft as a consequence.  I think gooey is the perfect word - but it translates to soft and not very interesting,  as well as having a bad chocolate cookie ratio.  Too much of a good thing can overwhelm the flavors, and unbalance the baked good...<br /><br />We all ate 2 (some may have eaten 3) but we all agreed that the while regular chocolate chip chips ahoy are terrific,  these are not.  I will not buy them again."
3,"I think these must be instant coffee b/c the cups feel empty when they're done, unlike the coffee ones which feel a little heavier b/c of the grounds and filter inside. Anyway, they taste like instant coffee and hot chocolate - not the greatest combination. I would also like it to be a bit creamier. With some creamer added they are tolerable. I won't buy them again, too bad I bought 24."
3,"I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to ""brown water."")"
3,"I had high hopes for these cookies because I adore Oreos and I love other Late July products (my favorite is the mini-peanut butter crackers).  I was disappointed, however.  These cookies taste stale and greasy to me.  They are way less sweet and less flavorfull than Oreos.<br /><br />So I took them to work to get rid of them, and coworkers went wild.  They were gone quickly, and I know some of them plan to buy these regularly now.<br /><br />Each cookie has 55 calories, by the way.<br /><br />I recommend trying to find them at your local grocery store before buying them in bulk on Amazon.  Here in Minneosta, Cub Foods sells them in a 9 oz box for a few dollars."
3,"amazon  sell this  item at very expensive  price<br />  just small  piece for over  $10  box<br />anyway  the taste  is good<br />for  $5  box is ok lah"
3,"It how takes three to four tea bags and steeping for at least half hour for me to get a large mug of licorice spice tea.  This was always my favorite tea, however I have noticed a decline in the strength over the last year or two.  However, the price is right."
3,"Okay, I admit it.<br />I was sucked in my the most adorable, romantic commercials for a cat food product that I have<br />ever seen. I vowed to buy at least some Fancy Feast each week just to show my support for that commercial!  LOL<br /><br />The cats love the wet food. It is very expensive, and from what I have read on the labels, you are<br />definitely paying for the IMAGE, not the quality or quantity of the food. (The cans are only 3 ounces<br />compared with 5.5 ounces in the other can styles.) I still get it, and they love the ones with cheese the most.<br /><br />So, I thought we'd give the dry food a try. I had my husband grab a bag when he was at the grocery store.<br />How bad could it be, right?  Same company, same ""gourmet"" promotion on the foods, so surely it has great stuff<br />in it, right?  Well, shocker - NOPE.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is made by the Purina company in St Louis, MO. They are the same ones who make the generic dog chow,<br />cat chow, rabbit chow, ________ (fill in the blank) critter chow.  They are all full of fillers that animals don't need,<br />because it is cheap to manufacture. Why I thought this might be different, I do not know.<br /><br />First off, food mfgs have found the kitty equivalent of addictive MSG, and load their foods with it.<br />This one is no different. Note that BOTH our cats went crazy over this food, inhaling it out of my hand<br />before I could even get more out of the package. Fancy Feast knows how to make things that smell/taste good to cats.<br />However, most food mfgs know how to make things that TASTE good - how they got there, well, you might not really want to know.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients list (which is in the order of the QUANTITY of the item) for this ""gourmet"" cat chow - bear with me, this is<br />a really long list of iffy ingredients, artificial junk and food coloring):<br /><br />Brewers Rice<br />Poultry By Product Meal<br />CORN GLUTEN meal<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Soybean Meal<br />Animal Liver Flavor<br />Chicken<br />Turkey<br />Phosphoric Acid<br />Calcium Carbonate (in case they get indigestion?! This is what's in Tums!)<br />Salt<br />Natural & Artificial Flavors<br />Potassium Chloride<br />Dried Yeast<br />Choline Chloride<br />Added Color, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2 and ""other colors"" (Why?!?)<br />Taurine<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Ferrous Sulfate<br />Vitamin E Supplement<br />Niacin<br />Manganese Sulfate<br />Vitamin A Supplement<br />Calcium Pantothenate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Copper Sulfate<br />Riboflavin Supplement<br />Vitamin B12 Supplement<br />Pyridoxine<br />Hydrochloride<br />Folic Acid<br />Vitamin D3 Supplement<br />Calcium Iodate<br />Biotin<br />Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (a form of Vit K)<br />Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />Sounds yummy, huh?<br />The meat is way down the list, after all the corn, soybean and rice fillers and glutens.<br /><br />How on earth does cat food need artificial food dyes?  The cats won't care.<br />There are many known reactions to food dyes in people - I am sure our pets don't need it either.<br />Was the food too yellow with all the grain meal and gluten, or too white from all the fats?<br /><br />So, the cats love it. I will now consider this the equivalent of a bag of potato chips for humans -<br />okay some times, but NOT all the time. I'll have to watch our oldest cat. He gets super itchy with wheat<br />grain or gluten in foods, so I'll watch for reactions to the corn.<br /><br />Cats are carnivorous, and do not eat grains in the wild. However, especially with the manufacturing plant<br />smack dab in farming country, they can apparently get all kinds of leftover grains cheap?<br /><br />If you buy this for your kitties, just know that you are buying the IMAGE more than a quality food.<br />This is not really different than the super cheap pet food.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed to read that ingredients list, when they could do SO much better for our pets.<br />We'll use this as their treats, rather than their main dry food. We'll stick with our Blue Buffalo for that, which is<br />grain free and actually has meat for the first ingredient!<br /><br />Fancy Feast - marketing genius, but sloppy on the nutrition."
3,"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all."
3,"I agree with one reviewer that I'd like a little more salt. Mine arrived very melted, in one giant clump. They are very sticky so it was quite messy to eat them. I do live in a warm climate so I kind of expected to have that issue. They taste pretty good but if you are looking for a gourmet sea salt and caramel candy, you won't be thrilled with these. I tried a sea salt caramel in a wine store and was amazed, it was delicious but a package of only 5 candies was very pricey so I ordered these. Next time I think I'll just spend the money for a smaller amount of really good quality caramels. These are much better than the caramels you can buy in a grocery store, just not quite salty enough for me."
3,"These crackers serve a purpose and have an okay taste although they are kind of bland.  I usually eat them with salami and cheese so the flavor from the other products helps.  These crackers are the best ones I've found on the market so will continue to buy them.  They also are closest to a Ritz cracker in size, shape, and crunch.  The other crackers I've tried leave an aftertaste and are paper thin."
3,"These cookies have the same old great Pamela's taste, however the box that I received contained 50 packets of broken and smashed cookies.  The cookies are packed two in a foil pouch, 50 pouches in a cardboard shipping box.  Every last one of the pouches was damaged (I assume during shipping) with damage ranging from both cookies broken into two pieces to the more common extreme of opening a pouchful of crumbs.  Still edible, but oh, so annoying.  Had the cookies been packed or shipped to avoid damage I would have given this product 5 stars for their excellent flavor (mild peanut butter, good chocolate wallop) and sweet tooth satisfaction."
3,"These are ok but I'm not sure if I'll get them again. There are other options as far as low carb that seem to be a better snack option. Quality was fine, I was just underwhelmed with the change to a smaller piece size since the last time I ordered."
3,"This was my first time trying Fee's Whisky Barrel-Aged bitters. I was somewhat disappointed that they do not contain any alcohol. In that way they feel different when compared with other bitters, and I feel that more is needed in cocktails. They are predominantly cinnamon-flavored and do not feel as complex as I expected - I was expecting perhaps more of a charred oak flavor. Overall they are not bad, and I can certainly find some use for them, but they are priced fairly high, and I personally still prefer Angostura bitters in my Manhattans and Old Fashioneds."
3,"Nicely package, rather tasteless green tea.  I think it is meant for restaurant use.  Too much packaging for me.  The service was very prompt.  I will not order this product again because I do not like the tea."
3,"Nice flavors, plus, noodles weren't sticky but, for us, the upset of post-prandial indigestion was a killer...ruined the day!"
3,"My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!"
3,"I had never heard for Marley's Coffee before, so as the was reading all of the information on the box, the last thing I looked at was the top of the box, to find out that the Marley is as in Bob Marley!<br /><br />Upon first looking at the box, the first thing I noticed was how the perimeter of the box reminded me of Christmas, with the red, green and gold colors.<br /><br />I especially loved what I saw written on the back of the box.  It really seems to come from the heart.<br /><br />It says ""That pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial.  They know where their beans come from, and how they are grown.  The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness"".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. ""We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace"".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for."
3,"Instant coffee is not my first choice when I drink coffee. I prefer fresh brewed. However, there are situations when you cannot brew a coffee of your choice: at the office or when I travel and want to have coffee in my room.  In such situation I use Folgers coffee.  I have a jar in my office, and take a small zip lock bag with Folders coffee when I travel.<br /><br />I have tried other instant coffees and prefer Folders for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I like strong flavored coffee with deep color, other coffees do not give me the same flavor with just one tea spoon<br /><br />2: Compared with Starbuck's Via instant coffee (which fits the bill for strong flavor) it is much more economical without large difference in taste.<br /><br />3: It dissolves in hot and cold water (with a bit of extra stirring), which is important if you are using it when you are travelling, since you may or may not have hot water in the room.<br /><br />4. Most frequently I drink my coffee black and Folders is not bitter black.<br /><br />So, even though I generally prefer brewed coffee I always have some Folders instant coffee on hand for those occasions when brewed coffee is not an option."
3,"Not bad for pasta made and not fresh. I have had fresh parpadelle and it is wonderful. I can also find bagged pasta in town."
3,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC"">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> is a good product that is a nice alternative to taking multi-vitamin tablets or drinking Vitamin Water and the like.  For those that believe in taking multi-vitamins, one serving a day is about the equivalent of one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins.  The serving size of ½ floor ounce per 8 ounces of water is about a teaspoon.  The taste was stronger than I was expecting, and the fruit punch flavor tasted more like a tart pink-lemonade to me.  This is similar to Crystal Light, but I found this product to have less of an artificial sweetener aftertaste.  Your mileage may vary as taste is entirely subjective.<br /><br />PROS<br />++ Large bottle brings down the per serving cost of the product<br />++ One serving equal to one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins<br />++ Less artificial sweetener aftertaste than Crystal Light or Mio, at least for me<br />++ Added caffeine and Taurine may give some people an energy boost<br />++ More economical than competing drinks like Mio and Vitamin Water<br /><br />CONS<br />-- Recommended shelf life is only 30 days<br />-- No clear area to see how much is left in the bottle<br />-- Bottle cap made of fragile cheap plastic and could be prone to leaking<br />-- Bottle is too large and requires refrigeration, so it's not ideal for travel<br />-- Still ridiculously expensive when compared to generic multi-vitamin tablets<br /><br />WARNINGS<br />++ Refrigeration recommended after opening<br />++ Not for children!  It says so right on the bottle<br />++ Some are more sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners than others, so try a sample first<br />++ Multivitamins are not for everybody, so consult your physician if necessary<br />++ Too much vitamin intake can be bad, so portion control is necessary<br />++ Contains Taurine which is animal derived<br /><br />The product is not vegan friendly, because it contains Taurine which is animal derived.  Will the added caffeine and Taurine provide an energy boost beyond the product's nutritional content?  Your mileage may vary here as well.  I suspect this will not have a noticeable benefit to those who are used to consuming 40 ounces of coffee per day.  But it may replace the caffeine craving that many people satisfy with sugary sodas.<br /><br />The packaging is large, designed to make 24 portions.  It is re-sealable, and they recommend you refrigerate after opening.  But the cap seems like it is very breakable, particularly for a bottle designed to be stored cap-side down.  The signage is on a plastic label that surrounds the bottle, but there is no clear area to see how much product is left in the bottle.  Even with refrigeration, the recommended shelf life is only 30 days.  So this product will work best for those who have at least one serving daily.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is a good product that provides another alternative for those looking for vitamins or a caffeine boost.  The shelf life is not very long.  And the packaging could use some improvement.  But the product itself is better tasting than I expected, and it will definitely appeal to some people.<br /><br />Enjoy."
3,"The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!"
3,"I think this has a VERY STRANGE SMELL!!  Yuck---I can't imagine putting it in my food or cooking with it.  I use it on my skin & everytime I do I am wondering if something is wrong with it.  Anybody else agree with me?  Not sure if I will buy this again.  Help---any feedback will give me peace-of-mind!!"
3,"There's really nothing wrong with the caps, as long as you remember to face the flat side down into the cup. The ""issue"" I have is CLEANING the used k-cup (rising all the grinds out and letting the cup dry). Then there's having to keep track of how many times you've reused the same cup. If you want to go ""greener"" and save some money at the same time, go with the reusable plastic container with the wire mesh basket. In my opinion, the coffee tastes as good as refilling a k-cup. You still have to clean the unit, but at least you don't need to track how ""old"" it's getting through repeated use. Hope this helps :)"
3,"The box had been opened before and was taped with Scotch tape Several of the kcups were leaking into the box and had to be tossed That is the first time that has happened but I was very disappointed."
3,"Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy."
3,"I purchased the White Cheddar flavor based on the good reviews and really wanted to like it, but the salt in the product is too much for my taste. Thank you"
3,"I purchased these coffee's which arrived in good time.  Nine of the coffee's I received were not usable as they were not full K-cups, some were almost empty.  This was highly disappointing.  I also should have paid more attention as many of the products received were not ""coffee""  I would not purchase from this person again.  Receiving nine (9) unusable coffee's is not my idea of a good product and not a good use for my money."
3,"I purchased these because I was curious to what all the different fruits would taste freeze-dried.  I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.  However, I think these would be really good to mix into your morning cereal, both dry and with liquid, hot or cold.<br /><br />Half of these packages had a considerable amount of powder at the bottom...so I'm thinking I lost about 10% of the 1.5 oz of product."
3,"I was a little skeptical at first when I got these for my kids, but I came away impressed.  They loved the taste of the grapefruit, apple, & pomegranate flavors, and I felt good that with fruit juice and added vitamins Izze is healthier than regular soda.  Downsides: they are still concentrated simple carbs, there are some health concerns regarding the health effects of carbonated beverages, and the premium price."
3,"I bought five of these fruitcakes to last me two holiday seasons.  I heard that fruitcake tends not to go bad, so I figured with the great price here on Amazon, it was worth stocking up.<br /><br />The cakes I ate in December were FLAWLESS--absolutely a delight to eat, particularly for Yuletide.  However, I found that my ""stock up"" idea back fired and I ended up throwing away three of my remaining fruitcakes away in June.<br /><br />I am not sure why it was...but as they just sat on the shelf, I became more afraid of them--until I finally threw them out.  That thin plastic covering just doesn't say ""fresh"" to me as well as a metal tin does.<br /><br />So buy these when you are ready to eat them...you will really enjoy the taste.  But saving them on the shelf for a year?  No.  If you want to save one or more for later, I really suggest freezing, just to be safe!<br /><br />Very good fruitcake!"
3,"These were Ok not as good as some of the other pumpkins I have had."
3,"I took a chance and bought this coffee because of the reviews.  I have to agree abut the bold flavor and taste. I guess you wondering why I only gave it 3 stars.  It's the dam cheap as K-cups!!  I've only had two that didn't bursting while brewing.  My wife, who loves this coffee, is getting tired of seeing all of the floaties (grounds) in her cup.  And that's just half of the issue because now I need to clean out the keurig for the next time want coffee."
3,"it's not your typical pretzel. I don't eat much pumpernickel, so it took me half a bag to get used to. after that, I liked it. I don't like that it comes in a pack of 12; these are regular sized packs. I was hoping for snack size packs. Anyway, the best thing about this is that it is good fer ya and has a different flavor; it's always good to play with the palette a little. world peace!"
3,"It's a little odd to get 8 loose K-cups in a package, but I couldn't figure out another way to go through a number of them, from different brands, to see what I wanted before ordering 24 of them.  Glad I did... some of the items in this package tasted great, some of them were mediocre, and a few were vile, one brand of cider tasting remarkably similar to what Red Bull and shampoo mixed together probably tastes like."
3,"Why was this cake so dry?  Did I overcook it (by 5 minutes)?  It crumbled mercilessly and the streusel was missing in the middle of the cake.  Why did the directions say to whisk the glaze...my whisk got all balled up.  I really don't think that this saved any money and not much time.  I will never buy this again but the taste (ignoring the texture) was good."
3,"First off, I received a bag of this coffee via the Vine Program to review at no cost.  Secondly, I am more of a bold, ""slap-me-in-the-face"" French Roast coffee drinker (or StarBucks Gold Coast), so I had my reservations about this decaf.<br /><br />And ... Well, for me, this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package, an OK flavor once brewed (sort of a nutty strange flavor at first), and once consumed, left an after-taste in my mouth.<br /><br />It is definitely a different roast than I am used to, but it is ""decent"" for a pre-ground Melita decaf.  More of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion.  Overall ... not too bad.<br /><br />I give this coffee a so-so recommendation."
3,"When I searched for ""gourmet toffee"" this product came up high on the list. Well, for starters, it's NOT toffee at all. It's an assortment of vanilla, lemon, and orange flavored nougat squares with almond pieces in it.<br /><br />Overall: delicious. Just not what I expected at all.<br />Additionally: The packaging is really neat and Italian-looking."
3,"I ordered organic decaf  and organic regular dark french roast.  The decaf was organic but the regular french roast was not.<br />The sticker with the bar code said Org WB.  I guess it got put on the wrong bag.<br />  Since you can not return food items,  I guess I will be using  what I did not order."
3,"These are okay, but like other reviewers have mentioned dogs need to be monitored while chewing these. These are essentially rawhide, so they eventually get very soft and pliable, and dogs who tend to gulp food/treats may try to swallow these. My recommendation for the most effective care (albeit one of the more difficult solutions) would be brushing daily."
3,"I wish every brand would offer a 1 can sample for sale or even free so I can find out if my cat will eat it before<br />buying 12 cans."
3,"I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive."
3,"Amendment - Still GREAT - BUT Just reordered - 45% increase since May 12 - 45% is NUTS - Product GOOD but 25.00 to 36.00 ! ! WOW NOT a GOOD WOW<br /><br />Great love them - the only place can now find is here ! Most stores changing to other versions - something good they have to change - long shelf life -  but they will never make it."
3,"I like the orange, but make sure you dilute this more than you would the others as the flavor is very, very sweet.  I'm not going to buy it again, but I will finish the box."
3,"I find diet Snapple Peach Tea drink mix a noticeably better tasting product.  The peach and tea flavors are stronger, the drink looks and tastes less watery, and there's no chemical aftertaste.  If price rules out Snapple, consider peach-flavored Lipton diet iced tea mix.  I see that Amazon reviewers rate the taste comparable to Snapple, and it costs less than Crystal Light."
3,"I buy this at my local Kroger store in the organic section.  The refined is not a 'soft' as the unrefined product that Spectrum sales.  This version does not have a coconut taste or smell and does not rub into your skin as well as the unrefined version does.  I think I will use this small jar as hair conditioner and weekly 'grease' for my african american scalp as well as cooking.  The refined versions around will not have the coconut flavor so it's better for all purpose cooking."
3,"I purchased this item just before Halloween. My kids love Hershey's chocolate products and I figured this year's trick-or-treaters would snap them up, too. My only complaint is that after I purchased them, I found the same package for a better price by several dollars. That was disappointing, since I count on Amazon for ""best"" pricing on most items."
3,"I normally love this product - 5 stars - but in this shipment the bars were all hard like a rock. I wonder if it had been stored improperly prior to shipment. Still tasted great, but not the soft like the KIND bars I buy in the store."
3,"A bit disappointed in this one. Was hoping for more of a taste here. pretty boring."
3,"To begin with, I opened the package and found about 20% of the cookies had already crumbled into pieces.  That's how fragile these cookies are.  With homemade cookies, I've always preferred the soft and chewy ones, but these go beyond soft.  I found the taste of the cookie itself to be only okay, and the fudge filling wasn't what I would call gooey.  I tried eating these at room temperature, warmed in the microwave, and cold from the fridge, and there are still plenty of store-bought cookies I would prefer over these."
3,"The taste kind of hung with me but wasn't all that different from the five-hour energy drink flavor. It's very bitter. I mainly bought it cause I liked the bottle. I'm very comfortable with energy drinks, usually drinking a few Monster or Red Bulls everyday but with this I could actually feel my heart pumping. I don't know if I was more energetic or not but it was a interesting bottle so I wasn't really in it for the stay awake aspect. Considering five hour energy runs about $2 at a gas station, this is comparable in price and effect."
3,"Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO."
3,"When I purchased the popcorn oil, I was hoping to be able to do away with adding extra butter/butter flavored topping to my homemade popcorn. While the product performed well, the popcorn was colored a bit and tasted fine, I found that using just the Real Theater oil was not enough flavoring for my taste. There is nothing wrong with this product, it's just not for me and I won't be buying it again. I, for one, am sticking with using a decent quality, store-bought vegetable oil, good quality unpopped kernels and I'm going to order the butter flavored popcorn topping offered here at Amazon that comes from the same supplier as this popping oil. I've purchased the topping before, it's very good and for me, it's the way to go. I'm rating the oil 3 stars because it's a fine product, just not what I has wishing it to be."
3,"I ordered this powder after having it at a coffee shop. It is sugar-free, but at 50 calories per 1.5 TBL, not calorie-free. Moreover, when I ordered my cold chai tea latte, the server used 1/4 cup of powder (120 calories) to get the true flavor. She used a blender with chipped ice and it was smooth; at home, when I tried to use it in hot chai (as shown on box), it clumped up and wouldn't mix in. So, while it is tasty, it takes more than the container suggests to get real flavor from it and it is difficult to mix in a hot beverage. Given its price, I am disappointed."
3,"We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture - I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars."
3,"I always order from this comapny and was suprised that the pig ears were alot smaller this shipment however i will order again as it was never a problem before"
3,"The fireballs are much smaller than they appear.  In other words, they are not the usual size of fireball - they are miniatures.  Not what I expected - never would have ordered had I known they were so small."
3,"Plain and simple, this is pretty generic tasting granola. I've had tons of different types/brands of granola and this one ranks right in the middle of the pack.<br /><br />The chocolate isn't sweet, which is perfect. Milk chocolate in granola just doesn't stand up to the hearty/nutty taste of the oats and grains. The chocolate came melted in my bag (go figure...), so I just tossed it in the freezer and the chocolate pieces firmed right up.<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty tasty treat just that for the price I'll stick to my plain granola and adding my own dark or semi sweat chocolate pieces to it. Tastes the same if not better then this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No additives/preservatives.<br />Quality ingredients.<br />Chocolate isn't super sweet (which I think is a pro, some might see it as a con).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price.<br />Is pretty generic tasting, nothing extraordinary.<br />High in calories, but what granola isn't?"
3,"This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for. It does have a sweet fruit juice flavor and is carbonated as the description describes, but somehow they don't blend well together. I think kids would like the flavor. They would be easily fooled into thinking they're are drinking soda. But for an adult it is overly sweet."
3,"I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!"
3,"We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind."
3,"I wouldn't buy this product again, it isn't bad chocolate, but it isn't great chocolate either.  Truthfully, Hershey's tastes much better.  The box is neat, so, if you're looking for a new type of gift for someone, then it is worth a try because it is German chocolate, especially for a child.  A child would enjoy this.  A chocolate lover would rather have Wockenfuss chocolates."
3,"This Wrigley's Green Apple gum has, to me, a distinctive and quite good Green Apple flavor for the first few seconds but then develops a slightly chemical taste that lingers. While it isn't so bad that it has to be spit out, it doesn't live up to taste at the start.<br /><br />Interestingly enough my son says he doesn't notice the chemical taste so it might vary from person to person, which might explain the mixed reviews.<br /><br />CFH"
3,"I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds."
3,"We have been purchasing Traverse Bay cherries in the 14 oz packages for some time but moved to an area where they weren't readily available.  So we had this delivered several times through the Amazon subscription service (which is a terrific service, by the way).<br /><br />It would have been a convenient and decently priced solution, but the cherries arrived kind of sticky and gummed together.  We suspect it has to do with shipping?  They are okay to use in cooking, for example I eat them every morning in hot oatmeal, but they aren't good for use in snacking, salads, etc.  After the second delivery arrived in same condition we gave up and have found a source for the smaller bags at a decent price and they arrived in a much more palatable condition."
3,"My dog liked these and they fit in her ""play ball"" well but the price was too high for what you get. The bag of treats is small."
3,"Like that it's Organic but can find same item with that quality with larger quantity.  My son likes the taste.  It's an option for a dry snack or travel snack.  So there are pluses, but the price for the small amount doesn't make it a total win."
3,"I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter..."
3,"Coffee was acceptable in strength (brewed as 9 oz cup) but there was little 'butter pecan' flavor to speak of.  I'm not likely to reorder this flavor.  I did appreciate each pod wrapped individually.  This keeps all pods fresh until used.<br /><br />Update (Sep-06-09): The flavor is growing on me a bit -- still not butter pecan -- but it's an OK cup of coffee."
3,"When I received this product, it smelled so good and fresh! For me personally, however, I prefer the Marques de Paiva organic decaf taste. While I definitely will still finish this coffee, it is not as smooth as Marques and sort of smoky tasting (I am not a coffee expert so I am not sure of the correct description words). However, just to have organic is great! And it definitely comes recently roasted which is a plus."
3,"If you are a cashew fan, you wil love this. The cans I purchased were mainly cashews - of which I am not a big fan. However, while I do not care for cashews, I do have friends who would find that a plus rather than a minus regarding this product! Bottom line, if you like cashews, it's five stars. If not, don't purchase this item."
3,"I've been trying to duplicate the terrific spicy chai tea I get at my two favorite local Indian restaurants and so far the only one that has come close is the Third Street brand.  This Tazo brand is very good, but it doesn't have the spicy kick that Third Street Chai has.<br /><br />If you're used to this brand or don't go for spicy chai, then Tazo is very good, but if you want a bit of 'umph' to your chai, definitely go with  Third Street!"
3,"I love cookies and I love Newman's Own products, so when I saw that Newman's Own were coming out with Organic Ginger Snap cookies, I had to try them. Made with Organic Flour and Sugar, these Ginger Snaps are form the Newman's Own Organics line, run by Paul Newman's daughter, Nell. Now I have to say these cookies pack a powerful punch of flavor. If you don't like your ginger snaps to be too spicy, I would steer clear of them. They are very crunchy and tasty,but I had to have a tall glass of iced tea by my side when eating them because they really have a load of ginger in them. They are a great bite size and have real candied ginger bits in them. Even though they are a bit spicier than I generally like, I still polished off the bag quite quickly! I am looking forward to trying more from the Organic line of Newman's products."
3,"A packaged substitute for a s'more, the Mallomars have a very thin graham cookie, topped by a large marshmallow, and all drenched in chocolate.  They are alright for an occasional snack, but my children enjoyed these more than I did. My children actually altered the Mallomar to make it a little more scrumptious.  They placed the whole cookie on top of a graham cracker and said it tasted great that way!<br /><br />I'm all for stories, and I liked how they attempt to tell their story on the box--that Mallomars have been enjoyed in New York City for decades, and its most loyal fans reside there.  Now they're spreading across the nation.  Makes you think about what you're eating."
3,"I previously purchased the regular gummy bears by surf sweets which were GREAT so we thought sour would be great too.<br />They are not particularly sour and there is a 'sugar' coating on the outside which makes them even sweeter (not sour)<br />so if you like that kind of thing you'll enjoy these but I guess I'm a gummy purist so I'll stick with the regular bears.<br />Oh and you might want to hide the box, the little package size makes it easy to eat more than one :)"
3,"I had one of the ""tiger"" boxes of Bengal Spice tea for quite some time, but never tasted it.  When I finally tasted it, I was delighted.  It was superb. (Bengal Spice is, by the way, a combination of spices and of roasted chickory.)<br /><br />I don't care much for green tea.  But Bengal Spice was so good that I was able to steep it with bags of green tea, producing an excellent combination.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to order a six-pack of Bengal Spice. But one of the recent reviews that I had read was correct.  The formulation is dramatically different.<br /><br />The tea that I just received is pretty good.  I only found it to be ""good"" by adding a bit of apple juice.  Unfortunately, it's no longer superb.<br /><br />On well, I guess I'll buy more anyway. I just don't care that much for the taste of green trea."
3,"The gas and diarhhea I experienced about 5 hrs. later, OMG!!.  I guess everyone doesn't experience the intestinal issues that can come with the maltitol and xylitol sweetners.  Other than that, the syrup is very good.  Good thing I didn't work that day!"
3,"This is a good cup of joe, it does have a pleasant aroma and smooth flavor. I have been trying<br />different blends of coffee for my Kurig brewer and found this to be a little on the weak side."

3,"I'm sure these would be great for a larger dog, my doxie couldn't get them out of the ball nor could he really chew on them.  When I tried to give him the treat alone he turned up his nose at it."
3,"I bought this for my 4 month old Frenchie and he just seems absolutely disinterested in it lol. The way the bottle is shaped along with the rope it's almost ""by accident"" that the treats come out. He plays with it for about 5 minutes but then goes back to his IQ TREAT BALL that I also bought on Amazon. I feel like you have to basically flip this bottle upside down and mess with the rope for it to come out and I don't see Jackson being able to do that. If the bottle is laying flat as in the picture, how does the treat come up the neck and out the hole? He does grab the rope and run around with the bottle but I can tell this is not his most favorite toy."
3,"this used to be an awesomely organic solution to healthy petfood with no fillers.... i have been informed that the company is soldout and is no longr as quality since it is mass produced. i would rate it about the same as iams or purina now.(we now use 'taste of the wild'- made with blueberries and buffalo to name a few)"
3,"Greens grew fast and well. No problems. Bit pricey as is all the Aero refills."
3,"This decaf tea will make a dark cup of tea. However much of the aromatic oils that are part of the experience of drinking tea are missing.<br /><br />The packaging of this product may have something to do with this - each bunch of 50 tea bags is placed into a cardboard box which is wrapped in a thin sheet of plastic. 6 of these wrapped boxes are then placed into a holder which is then also wrapped in plastic wrap. Given the thin plastic used the aromatic oils are lost pretty soon after manufacture.<br /><br />Other manufactures individually wrap their tea bags in individual foil lined pouches. Others use heaver plastic to hold the oils in.<br /><br />If you are fussy about tea I'd pass. T**d*r J**s has better decaf tea than this."
3,"The product itself is pretty straight forward.  It's got pureed organic baby food in a little pouch.  Easier to transport than the little glass jars.  If your baby eats a lot, there's a lot more food per pouch.  The nozzle and cap makes it easy to squeeze straight onto a spoon and feed baby with no mess (at least on this end).  Also, since the food theoretically is being transferred from the pouch to the spoon, you don't have cross-contamination of the baby's mouth germs being reintroduced back into the jar of baby food.<br />The color of this particular product leaves a bit to be desired.  But the flavor was fine (to me) and the pear and garden greens combo is pretty nice and healthy.<br /><br />I echo the same concerns that another reviewer posted.  I actually got this product a little earlier since I knew my baby would be eating in a month or so.  Lo and behold, once I opened it when he was ready for solids, the expiration had already passed.  Perhaps this is only an issue for the free stuff we're getting through Vine reviews; I sure hope so.  But somebody ought to think twice about giving out stuff on the cusp of expiration that is meant for babies and their uniquely sensitive systems.  This is also relevant given that the baby food comes packaged as a pack of 12.  Now, I don't know who would buy a package of 12 food pouches of the *exact* same flavor.  Your baby must really love pear and greens.  Moreover, I mentioned that each pouch is 4.5 ounces.  That's more than 2 glass jars' worth.  My personal thought is that unless your child has texture issues or low oral muscle tone, the baby is probably going to move through the pureed food stage a lot faster than you could possibly go through 12 pouches of this baby food (I'm assuming that you're also providing him/her with other flavors, though).<br /><br />I also recommend looking into the Happy Baby brand of baby food.  It also comes in neat little pouches and has organic pureed fruits and veggie combos; but it adds additional Salba grains that are naturally rich in Omega-3s."
3,"I used to get these oats when I first started eating GF.  However after eating steel cuts oats for a year or more I wanted a break and went back to rolled oats.  These oats taste good but have a consistency not unlike mashed potatoes.  One reviewer described the oatmeal as ""creamy.""  I don't think oatmeal should be creamy.  I want my oats to ""fight back"" a bit more than that when I eat them.  I have ordered GF oats from nuts.com and will re-order from them when my current order is finished."
3,"I bought this for Thanksgiving for those of us who were dieting and for my daughter who as a gluten intolerance. I also had other San Sucre mousses.<br /><br />While this mix was good, it is very strong (spices). We ate it, but I would not buy it again.<br /><br />BUT - I definitely recommend the San Sucre Mousses Mixes!"
3,"was given this as a gift from my dear cousin daniel from new york. he told me if i take good care of it in a week it will pay off. now that i think about it he probably meant how you get ""some good vibes"" from taking care of nature. i think he's full of it. but the plant is cool so i guess i'll keep it."
3,"This was an ok bar.  Not my favorite of the Kashi line-up, but still not bad in a pinch when I have nothing else for breakfast.<br /><br />The chocolate almond bar tasted mainly of chocolate.  In fact, I really didn't taste the almonds at all.  I'm sure they added to the crunchy texture, but predominately I tasted the other grains in there all liberally coated with a milk chocolate.  This was made even more chocolatey by the thick coating on the bottom as well.  So all in all, definitely chocolate if you couldn't tell from the description thus far.  I do enjoy the crunchy aspects of this particular type of bar as well, but compared to the Chocolate Pretzel and some of the other ones, I don't think it was quite as crunchy as it could have been.<br /><br />These are definitely a fitness bar.  8 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and 170 calories are packed right in.  This makes it the perfect choice for exercise or as a meal replacement.  I wouldn't recommend just snacking on it when you're hungry.  Choose a lower calorie snack for that type of meal.  Sugars are 13 grams, which isn't high, but it isn't the diabetic special either.<br /><br />Ingredients are alright.  It doesn't boast the organic ingredients that some bars too, but it does have that Kashi special seven whole grains ingredient in it.  The main sweetener is brown rice syrup and there is some evaporated cane juice crystals and fructose as well.  They also add some vitamins such as folic acid and zinc oxide into the blend too.  And of course there are almonds in this bar, so those with nut allergies should probably steer clear.<br /><br />Not a bad bar but I'd choose other flavors over this one.  There just wasn't anything special or unique seeming about it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
3,"These are weird little chips. They are nice and crunchy. The flavor is OK... but not good. The bags have 1.5 servings in them (so if you eat the whole bag they are 21 carbs; not 14). I doubt I will buy them again, but I will eat the rest of the carton."
3,"I've been looking for the old school red shoestring licorice of my childhood and sadly this is NOT it. I got the package in a timely manner, the price was ok but other than that the entire transaction was just OKAY. I'm not impressed with the texture or taste."
3,"Seems ok.  My cat liked them a lot at first.  Now, not as much.  They seem like they're getting cheesier smelling after being stored in the pantry."
3,"I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links."
3,"I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips, it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful."
3,"This bag of Great River Organic Milling Whole Wheat Pastry Flour was short 1 pound.<br /><br />I have two scales and both displayed ""24"" pounds for the weight.<br /><br />Now, surely, most of you would agree that is you pay for 25 pounds, you should get a full 25 pounds.<br /><br />Domino Sugar had a problem one time and they sent coupons for sugar to compensate for the weight shortage.<br /><br />One can only hope this company is not shorting all it's customers.<br /><br />Hopefully they will get their scales calibrated!<br /><br />Until then, be aware and WEIGH your bags."
3,"A hot cup of coffee (preferably with creamer or foamed milk) is my preferred way to start the day, but I thought I'd try out one of the cold coffee drinks just to see what I'd been missing. The product description uses the phrase ""Full-bodied,"" which is definitely an understatement; despite the high sugar content, a can of illy issimo's Caffe has an extremely bitter flavor that's almost biting.<br /><br />The first sip almost stopped me cold in my tracks because it was rather unpleasant at first, but like coffee in general, it takes a little while to start to really appreciate the flavor. There's a bit of a sweet aftertaste from the sugar, and the coffee itself will appeal to anyone who likes a darker roast. On the energy front, you will get a serious caffeine jolt just from one can.<br /><br />I still prefer a cup of hot coffee with creamer, but this isn't a bad on-the-go choice for anyone who likes a darker, more bitter flavor and doesn't mind iced versions of coffee."
3,"We order these by the case to sent to a friend of ours some distance off.  We thought the price was appropriate.  However, I picked up a box for myself at Publix and found that the store price for 6 boxes was less than I paid to Amazon."
3,"I sampled Kali Ginger and Lemon drink mix on a cold wintry day when my throat was a bit inflamed and sore.  I drank it hot as directed on the foil pouch.  To be honest, the first few sips burned quite a bit as they went down due to the ginger, but as I continued to drink, the lemon and honey flavors came to the fore.  After finishing the whole cup, my throat felt a little bit better, and I realized that overall, I had liked the beverage.<br /><br />That said, the big question is: did I like it well enough to order more?  And my honest answer is: probably not.  Gold Kali Ginger & Lemon is one of those products that I might enjoy on a rare occasion, but not one that I'm tempted to stock up on and make part of my regular diet.  There will definitely be a group of consumers that this spicy drink will appeal to, and to them, I heartily recommend it.  But as for me, a man who enjoys more traditional warm and cold beverages, let's just say that it really isn't my cup of tea."
3,"This seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips. Small, single serving bags.  I really like the plain, unflavored Popchips, but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste.  I plan to set up Subscribe & Save for just the plain."
3,"This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little ""spicy"" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that."
3,"I got one of these cakes when I was in the Cayman Islands and it was the best thing.  I think I also had one in the Bahamas and it was also terrific.  I don't know if it was the island atmosphere or perhaps the cakes were just fresher, but the one I ordered, while decent enough, tasted a little artificial, kind of like the plastic it was wrapped up in.  I still enjoyed it, but it just didn't have that same flavor I remember.  Maybe next time I'm in the Carribean I'll try it again and find out, but as for ordering online, I don't feel like it's the same."
3,"My gal and I take good care of our hair and mainly use natural hair care products.  Her hair is dry and brittle.  My hair is also dry.  After using her usual <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P85MAM"">NaturOli Soap Nuts Natural Shampoo - Organic Hair Care - Sulfate Free! - Ayurvedic Ingredients - Normal to Dry Hair - Unscented - 16oz.</a>; while I used my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LTP8VO"">Johnson's Baby Shampoo 20-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>, we applied this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> (CSH) for about a week.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Non-greasy with a apple-like scent.<br />>Our usual shampoos and this CSH conditioner left our hair softer and manageable with no scalp irritation but she still prefers her favorite <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RL92B0"">Komenuka Bijin Moisturizing Hair Treatment / Conditioner with Natural Rice Bran - 7.7 Fl Oz</a> while I don't feel the need for a conditioner. Tip: our dermatologist has always advised us NOT to use our fingernails vigorously when shampooing hair, always use fingertips gently to avoid scalp damage and to minimize premature hair loss (thinning/balding), and dandruff.  Use common sense.<br />>Hair breakage was already minimized with her prior usage of organic shampoo and conditioner so it's difficult to determine whether the CSH conditioner was effective.<br />>We liked this sample and it's easonably priced at $4.22 with free shipping from Amazon; It's only $4.01 with Amazon's ""Subscribe & Save"".<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Even though CSH conditioner has ""Nutrium 10"": ten vitamins and nutrients, there are a whole lot of other artificial ingredients including Zinc Sulfate and Lysine HCL.<br />>The conditioner is only the second step of a four step regimen: cleanse, NOURISH, treat, and repair.  The manufacturer obviously advises using ALL of their products within this system over 7 days for best results.<br />>Scent is ok during use but may smell a bit acrid to others.<br /><br />Overall:<br />My gal still prefers her organic shampoo and conditioner without all those synthetic chemical ingredients.  I still prefer scentless or lightly scented shampoos.  Individuals have different types of hair so shampoo and conditioner preferences are highly subjective.  If one has NO problems/sensitivities with artificial ingredients, then this CSH system is certainly worth a try."
3,"I'm a big fan of Weruva cat food, but my cats weren't thrilled with this particular flavor. They ate most of it, but didn't ""dig in"" like they usually do - just kind of picked at it. The dog, on the other hand, was more than happy to finish it off for them. I must admit that I was kind of glad when they didn't wolf it down, because it definitely smells very fishy and I was happy that I wouldn't have to buy it again! :)"
3,"I am torn on this product because my dog LOVES it and it keeps her occupied for hours, but it is really smelly. Worse then any bully sticks I have bought. It makes her smell but it also makes the whole room smell and it doesn't go away. I let her have this one I bought until she finished but I am not sure I want to buy another one."
3,"These are a pain in the rear, you need to take your used cup, empty it, make sure all the lid foil is off and then wash it good. Then fill it with coffee and then put lid on. It is like factory work and that is the last thing I want to do at 5am in the morning. The coffee never tastes as good as the K-cup. You can't reuse the K-cup too many times either as the filter inside rips or just wears out. There is one thing you must also remember...when you put your original k-cup in the first time unused, the machine punctured a hole in the bottom of cup, when you are going to put in your used cup with this lid you must line up the original hole else it will puncture a new one each time you use it. It does work OK but is it really worth the effort?....not to me."
3,"If you're drinking this on its own, no, there isn't a very strong cinnamon flavor to it.  If you drink your coffee like I do (with flavored creamer), it brings out a very nice flavor.  If you are going to use a flavored creamer, I recommend the International Delight Cinnabon creamer.  It's a great combination!"
3,"Our picky Shih-Tzu won't even eat doggy snacks. I topped his canned food with a few Chef Michael's kibbles. He ate around the kibbles first, then finally gobbled them up with the rest of his canned food. He won't eat any dry dog food unless it's mixed into his canned food.<br /><br />Our mutt loved this food, but she'll eat anything.<br /><br />Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin contains mostly semi-moist kibble bits and some crunchy bits too. It was given a low rating by  the Dog Food Advisor web site.  I'm not  sure I agree, but thought I'd share it with you."
3,"You have to soak these in water to just eat them plain or it is too difficult.  After a few days the water that the dates were soaked in becomes very sweet and it can be used in all sorts of recipes but I like them in molasses breads best, at least when someone is willing to make it for me: >.  These are very nice dates although somewhat expensive. I soak them in hot water and once the water is cool, keep them in the refridgerator and they are good to go."
3,"The jerkey tasted great however I feel the cans were very underfilled. All the cans were under half full and I know its says .44 oz but good grief, two pinches and its gone. Over priced in my opinion."
3,"I like dark chocolate. Prefer it over milk by a long ways. But after 6 weeks on a strict candida diet I ordered this. I was hoping for a treat to nibble now & then. Maybe my taste buds have changed but it tasted nasty to me. I had a friend try it to see, but she spit out the small bit she took. Not for me. But delivery was quick."
3,"Unlike the Fizzies of my childhood, these did produce a favorful drink, but you need to wait a rather long time for the fizzing to work. Don't know if it is because the formula is now diet conscious but I had planned to surpise some older family members with them. Glad I didn't because the rapid fizzing is gone."
3,"Blindfold someone, and they may not be able to tell the difference between this cookie and a girl scout tagalong. I guess if you are deathly seriously about your cookies, you'll notice some small difference. Not me. I don't know what this has to do with Oreos. No cream stuffing. Big deal, if you like chocolate and peanut butter you'll like this."
3,"I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these."
3,"My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
3,"I don't know if it is the high altitude(Colorado-6200ft) but many of the KCups exploded in the box.  Blew the tops right off of the KCups."
3,"Coffee is OK not great.<br />I can buy these at my local grocery store cheaper unless you take advantage of all of the discounts offered."
3,"It's the standard Horizon milk, in small packages that you don't have to refrigerate.<br /><br />The only reason I buy this is I bake, and I hate being halfway through a recipe and discovering I'm out of milk. With these packages, I throw it in the back of the cupboard, and it's there when I need it. Obviously, I use fresh when I have it!<br /><br />I suppose the main market for this is kid's lunches, where you don't want to worry about spoilage. It would be fine for that, although it's about the most expensive way to buy milk (and the price of for this today is twice what I paid, and is currently twice that from other sellers on Amazon, so check around!)<br /><br />They also show reduced fat milk, but shipped me the low-fat."
3,"The PROBAR Fruition bar is probably healthier than a lot of other bars or snacks on the market.  The strawberry flavor was not very prominent, and the bar has a bit of an apple flavor. I didn't think that it tasted bad and will continue to eat them. The bars were dense, but pretty smooth with just a little crunch from the nuts and seeds. The nutrition facts from the box states:<br />Serving size: 1 bar (48g)<br />Calories: 160, Calories from fat: 20<br />Total fat: 2g,  3%<br />  Saturated fat: 0g<br />  Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg  1%<br />Total Carbohydrate 34g  11%<br />  Dietary fiber: 4g  16%<br />  Sugars 22g<br />Protein 3g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 4%<br />Iron 6%<br />Percent values based on a 2,000 calorie diet<br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Organic date paste<br />Organic rolled oats<br />Organic brown rice syrup<br />Strawberry puree<br />Cashews<br />Apple juice infused strawberries<br />White chia seeds<br />Black chia seeds<br />Natural strawberry flavor<br />Strawberry extract<br />Tocopherols<br />Natural flavor<br />Ascorbic acid<br />Citric acid<br />Arabic gum<br />100% vegan; non GMO<br />Certified Organic by QAI<br /><br />Tocopherols are defined as ""fat-soluble vitamins consisting of tocopherols, especially alpha-tocopherol, that are found chiefly in plant leaves, wheat germ oil, and milk and that act as antioxidants in the body."" I thought it was interesting that the bars were certified organic, but the strawberry puree, the apple juice infused strawberries, and the strawberry extract were not identified as being organic."
3,"This product is very delicious but the quanity was a little small... It came in less time than stated and the beans are simply delicious!!!"
3,"The Switch Kiwi Berry tastes metallic and fake.  Neither my wife nor I could finish off the can because the flavor was so off.  The Watermelon Strawberry flavor was much better.  I couldn't identify any kiwi flavor at all, and the berry flavor did not taste like any berry I have ever eaten.  In fact, strawberry is the very last of the juice concentrates listed.  They mixed apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juices together.  I think having just one juice flavor would have been better because this mix was just bizarre.  Also, the drink contains 135 calories per 8.3 ounce serving.  At that rate, I'd rather have a Coke if I want carbonation or regular juice if I want something fruit flavored."
3,"It's a good bargain for $14 dollars a pound! But it's just your regular old jerky. No taste or anything, just your regular meat--regular jerky, you just get more bang for your buck!"
3,"GREAT POPCORN  COOKS  GOOD TO  BUT FOR ME  ITS TO SALTY"
3,"I was really looking forward to tasting the one bottle of water since I drink a lot of it (water). I buy Smart Water by the case. I have a sodium deficiency so need the electrolytes in the Smart water. I also live in a town that has no public water at all. We all have well water as our supply.<br /><br />This is a 1.5 bottle of water, which is a nice size. I drank it in one day and within that day I did get sick. I did not think it was the water until I read what alkaline water can do to you. I read, can't claim it, but read that the alkaline detoxes your body and neutralizes the acid in your stomach. We need acid in our stomach to process the food we eat. I read a lot of people that got sick drinking alkaline water, it might be a small percentage but I was one of them. Supposedly over time after it `cleanses' out yours system, you will feel better. With one bottle and getting sick, I cannot say that.<br /><br />It did taste good but not great. I could taste an aftertaste that was metallic like and it just did not seem crisp to me. I did finish the whole bottle, again in one day, but sadly would not buy this or drink this again if given a few more.<br /><br />The fact that it has so many additives, good or not, but yet no claims can be made or studies have been done to prove the benefits, I am leery.<br /><br />Yes it was good, not great, but getting so sick on the day I drank it and reading others that went through the same thing online is enough to keep me away."
3,"When I bought these I thought I was getting pimientos, but they are just bell peppers. Not that there's anything wrong with them, it's just not what I wanted to get. This company needs to be more accurate in its labeling."
3,"These reasonably healthy snacks got a thumbs up from my husband and four-year-old. I found them, well, different, in terms of snack food. Slightly sweet, but not overly so, with a hint of salt and sesame. These reminded me most of snacking on dry breakfast cereal. The chips/thins themselves are also about the same size as Frosted Flakes-size cereal bites. Not bad, but not exactly what I was expecting, based on the product photos and advertising. I was thinking they would be thinner, based on description, and more chip-like. (Maybe something in the rice cracker family? These are much denser than that.<br /><br />I can see how they'd be tasty on salads as a crouton replacement, though I haven't tried them that way yet, but can't see myself eating them out of hand all that often; though my son asked for more. These are just a little too dry and bland for my tastes and the sweetness, which lingers long after you eat them, kind of threw me off ... And this is from someone who regularly eats organic blue corn flax seed chips, not Lays or Doritos. (Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, taste-wise.)<br /><br />Though you're kidding yourself if you think these are health food, they are definitely a better option than regular chips at 130 calories for a good-sized serving, with only 45 of those calories coming from fat, though the sodium content is pretty high (135 mg/serving).<br /><br />Honestly, I was done after less than half a full serving (which the bag defines as about 46 chips), so these could be a fairly low-cal snack option, IF they fit your flavor profile. Though the marketing boast buzz is all about cocoa and its antioxidant properties, cocoa is at least halfway down the ingredient list, well behind two kinds of rice flour, which is mainly what you're eating here. (Brown rice flour is ingredient number one, followed by sunflower seed butter and I think regular rice flour is No. 3 or 4 on the list.)<br /><br />All in all, just so-so for me, and I don't think I'd go out and buy them again for myself, though they are far from terrible, and I will use the remainder on salads. But, given the flavor profile, if you're someone who likes to snack on dry cereal, you'll probably enjoy them BUT just buying the cereal will likely be a more cost effective, and likely calorie equivalent, option."
3,"Like the tea, its pretty strong is quite good. But the issue i have with is the packaging, the 2 packs i received both had tea spilled outside the boxes."
3,"too strong for my taste.  I ordered this coffee as it was rated highly and reccommened by a friend.  Its just bitter and has a bite that makes it unpleasant.  Overpriced I would say too."
3,"This is a great fast food option. I am a vegan and I usually have to cook all my food. This is a great pre-made option to add for a lunch on the go. I eat this either over rice or additional veggies. It is a little more watery than i thought it would be but that doesn't mean it is a bad thing. I will give some of there other vegan options a try after i finish up this batch."
3,"I absolutely love Pu-erh loose tea by Rishi and thought it might be fun to give a try of the ginger blend during the harsh winter times where ginger can be a real treasure in providing support to blood circulation, especially to women.<br /><br />As much as I hoped I could love this blend, I did not. The ginger aroma is way too strong. It is so over-powering that the pu-erh flavor is pushed away. It is like mashed-potatoes with all the peper flavor but not potato-ish at all. Odd and unsmart way of blending the ginger and pu-erh. They could be a perfect match.<br /><br />But it could be just me as tastes of teas are so personally different. Think about all the health benefits you could get from a pot of tea and give it a wave if you love trying new things out. It could be next on your favorate list."
3,"I bought this on Amazon becuase it disappeared from real stores. In comparison with the tea that was available in regular stores, this one has a sour off-taste, presumably, due to its oldness."
3,"Selling point was no GMO or MSG.  If you are sodium conscious do note that sodium content listed on package is listed as 37%.  I have not as yet used item and will tread carefully, still debating use beyond using a small amount as a seasoning."
3,"My cat preferred the chicken treat over the beef.  For that reason, I'm giving it three stars.  There was nothing wrong with the product...more of my cat's preference."
3,"We live in southern California, and the weather was hot.  The candy was packed with ""ice"" packets.  Unfortunately, the ""ice"" was not wrapped well and the entire case (box) of candy was wet.  Luckily the individual bags of m&m's survived.  Most of them were wet, but the candy inside was ok, thanks to the good bags around the m&m's themselves."
3,"It seems that this Yumberry Blackcurrat tea may have replaced the Wild Blackcurrent tea.  The Yumberry Blackcurrant is good, bur not as flavorful or have the bold fruity taste of the Wild Blackcurrant."
3,"Nothing wrong with it, just not my type of rice. It also didn't cook as well in my rice cooker compared to the normal jasmine rice that I buy"
3,"ESSENTIA, a slightly alkalinized water-beverage is a nice product to have on hand.<br /><br />Although, I believe in the benefits of alkalizing with every meal especially with leafy greens, I didn't recognize any benefits from just one 1.5-litre bottle.<br /><br />There was a very so slight silky taste I detected just above the water, but I suspect that because the added ingredients fell below the FDA's recommendation, they could claim that it's still 100% water and no additives.<br /><br />For whatever it's worth, drinking water has no downside.<br /><br />ESSENTIA-- 3.5 stars."
3,"I am used to eating corn flakes that are somewhat salty - yes, really! I can tolerate it being somewhat sweet but these are flakes are a tad too sweet - not my taste."
3,"I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ."
3,"My two dogs really enjoyed these treats and downed them in no time at all, In fact I wish they had been harder to chew, and lasted longer for the price they were"
3,"I was told that white balsamic vinegar was a nice change in salad dressing. I'm not positive this is what I wanted. It was surprisingly sweet to me. It may be different from white balsamic vinegar because it is a ""glaze"" . I read other reviews and tried to see if this was what I had wanted. still not sure. I do mix this with olive oil and add seasoning and like the results but I go easy on the glaze as I don't like my salad dressing too sweet. It has a good flavor. If someone could inform me as to if this is the vinegar I wanted, I would appreciate it."
3,"I like that it's healthy and natural. And I like this company. I just don't think this is a great recipe.<br /><br />Other than a fun crispy texture, the taste is just really unexciting. They sent me a free bag to review, and I'm definitely not motivated to buy a refill. In fact I'm not even very motivated to finish the bag they sent.<br /><br />If you don't mind high sugar, try this same company's granola bars. For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME"">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />For healthy, low-sugar, natural cereal, it's back to Bob's Red Mill Muesli for me.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDSES"">Bob's Red Mill Cereal Muesli,  4 - 18-Ounce Bags</a>"
3,"I bought this and I could not recall why.  When I use it for cooking it makes the food taste like coconut.  So cannot see using it a lot.  I love coconut but not on quesadias.  Instead I ordered coconut pills."
3,"This coffee is pretty stout. I was trying to stay away from the starbucks beans because they are too dark roasted for my liking. The kick ass coffee is just as dark.<br />The coffee itself is good, just not what I'm lookin for. I really wish the roast date was on the bag instead of the expiration date."
3,"I can't seem to find the twix box at my grocery store with 11 candy bars, and only 25 cents each one. Call me a cheapskate, but with postage the lowest is about 35 cents each in twin packs that melt together at room temperature. At least offer customers a discount for buying large boxes through the mail."

3,"Amazon, what is wrong with your shipping lately?<br /><br />The Marzipan pig is really cute, i love the product. However, came poorly packaged. One pig has a broken off ear form not being padded well in the box. Not exactly what one would expect from the highly priced decorative marzipan figurine.<br /><br />Disappointing."
3,"I expected the syrup to have a strong, concentrated lavender taste, so that I could use a few spoons to enhance the flavor of my desserts.<br /><br />But the taste and the smell are really light and can be hardly distinguished unless you consume the syrup by itself."
3,"I didn't have the appropriate brewer, so I just had to steep it. That may have affected the taste some, but probably not. I was intrigued by the combination of coffee and tea, but it didn't meet my expectation. I prefer my coffee a lot stronger and richer. This was pretty weak. That may appeal to some people, though. What I do like about it is that it is organic and fair-trade."
3,"A flat blade screw driver is required to remove the plastic cap, after the cap is removed the juice goes all over the place.  Good product, would be great in a glass bottle."
3,"I tried this brand because of its packaging. I bought the 6 bottle pack because my preferred brand came in industrial size. The syrup is nothing special and I would not consider it dark chocolate. Hershey's tastes more chocolatey than this does. I like that it is made with real sugar vs. HFCS. I won't be buying it again, but I will use the bottles to repackage my industrial size choice."
3,"My kitten loved this but it seemed to give him the runs. Adult wet food and dry foods were not doing this. I suspect its the milk ingredient. Make sure your cat is not lactose intolerant! It's not uncommon. [...]"
3,"I stopped feeding Grady the Calif. Nat. Deep Water Fish and Salmon & Sweet Potato because our oceans and fish are too polluted. The ocean is a toxic waste dump.<br /><br />He didn't care for the Salmon & Sweet Potato anyway"
3,"they're now 5 points on the Points Plus system.  The bag still says 2 from the old days so keep in mind it's not the cheap points snack it was.  Definitely not worth 5 pts in my opinion."
3,"Personally it is a 3 star for OUR tastes.  But I do not think it is a bad taste.  It is definitely not too strong but has a mellow and complimenting flavor.<br />In fact I rather think other will enjoy it's smooth taste and will be a great addition to their meals."
3,"I received these the other day and was very impressed with how they looked and how easy they were to break.  Unfortunately, ""Joey"" wasn't.  He ate them, but they made him sick and he only had maybe 1 1/2 of them over a 24 hour period because I was continuing his other treats to make a smooth transition.  I then ordered and tried the turkey and sweet potato formula and had the same reaction.  Maybe it is just too rich for him.  I wanted so badly for these to work for him too!  As usual, Amazon was ready to help me.  I don't think you can go wrong ordering from Amazon because of their superb customer service and products."
3,"I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes ""off"". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the ""sweet"" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters."
3,"I bought these for my cat and if I give them to him, he'll eat them, but it's not the type of treat he'll do tricks for or run over to eat. It's a healthier alternative to other treats, but I wouldn't buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior. These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat."
3,"Yes, it has the ""fake sugar"" taste, but it's okay.  The real downside to the product is the price.  In a coffee K-Cup, there is more to it than just coffee grounds in the K-Cup...there is a filter etc, and the brewing occurs in the cup.  With these cider K-cups, it's just ordinary drink mix in the K-Cup.  You're better off just buying the powder at the grocery store, and run the Keurig just for hot water, as you would for tea."
3,"fantastic ingredients. wish my cat would've eaten it. my dog didn't care for the dog food either. and he's not picky. Cat food is shaped into dark brown X & the dog food is round & flat (similiar to iams dog food)."
3,"I love their teas. Their hot cinnamon spice is truly excellent and the chocolate mint is very good. The sachets are really nice also and are very hard to tear. I was a bit disappointed with this tea. I have a hard time tasting the coconut. The chocolate comes through, however. It depends on how much money is spent on the tin. If it is $15 for 20 satchels that is a bit pricey. Most of the other H & S teas are less than $10. I would have expected more of the coconut taste come through. One of the other reviewers thought it was strong. Well it might be for them, but I can barely taste it. I really like the taste combination in other things. I give it 3 stars as long as the price is above $15."
3,"More than a ""hint"" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK."
3,"If you don't mind the smell similar to baby formula this will be OK for you but that smell turns my stomach so was unable to use although my daughter didn't seem to mind the taste in her cereal.  Gave to a friend and she had no problems with it and her son took it well in his cereal."
3,"My husband's favorite coffee at Starbucks is Pikes Place so I purchased this one.  It wasn't that great.  We both actually like the French Roast Dark Roast better."
3,"It's hard to review the efficacy of a product like Essentia's 9.5 pH Drinking Water after consuming just 1.5L (the sample size provided to Vine reviewers), so let's just say that as a water product goes, there's nothing either extraordinary or offensive about this H2O. The bottler went to a lot of work to fine tune the chemistry and flavor of this product (micro-filtration, UV lighting, reverse osmosis, mineral ""enhancement"" and something called ionic separation), but you're going to be disappointed if you pour a glass and expect it to taste like, umm, robust good health. Essentia's 9.5 pH Drinking Water tastes like...water, albeit with that trademark flat metallic taste that comes from altering the ingredient list a little.<br /><br />Is it worth the price? For somebody enduring the daily torment of GERD, I'd say it's definitely worth a try. Does it work? You'll have to rely on other reviewers to make that call."
3,"I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.  You end up with a mess on your hands.  Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!"
3,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:43 Mins<br /><br /></span>After experimenting with grocery store-type dog foods I settled on one sold by my vet. However, I thought that this brand might be worth trying. You will see from my video review that not all dogs are fond of it. I thought that it was just okay and the ingredient list is not very impressive. I hope that you enjoy my video."
3,"I was excited when I saw these as I don't like the mess associated with making an espresso.  However they do not work with my De'Longhi machine.  As another reviewer stated, I ended up with ""tan water"".  If I open the pods and pour the grounds into my machine they make a decent cup of espresso, but the idea was to avoid the mess."
3,"i had to return it because my son has a size 13 in shoe and felt very uncomfortable in it,,,being he's a diabetic we could not take a chance this can cause him harm."
3,"I love chamomile and being sensitive to caffeine its the perfect tea for me. This is my review on  Tazo Calm vs Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus. ML's underlying taste is orange, making the tea a bit tart.  Tazo has a hint of mint and lemon making it the perfect combination. The price: ML's box comes at $8.99 vs Tazo at $5.99.  They're both not organic so the price makes a big difference, I definately recommend the Tazo Calm over Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus."
3,"It was cheaper to buy this at Amazon, and nice to get it delivered to my door, but one of the flavors didn't agree with my 2 cats digestive systems so I donated a third of the box to the animal shelter making it less expensive to go to the store and pick my own flavor combinations. I hope the sweet kitties at the shelter like it!"
3,"BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon; prompt delivery, etc., etc. However, this coffee will expire in less then 3 months. So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!"
3,"For the kids. Even the kids that don't have to eat gluten free will enjoy this,"
3,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />i like this and will be buying more. however, it has a flavor that somewhat reminds me of coconut. i _know_ there is no coconut in it! [*grin*] there is still a taste that i interpret as coconut-like. i do NOT like coconut.<br /><br />after having two pitchers of this i have decided the odd taste is OK and that i will buy it again so i can have the variety i crave. i nearly decided otherwise, tho. i recommend trying a smaller batch before buying one of these cartons.<br /><br />rated a THREE since there is nothing significantly more or less that expected.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
3,"A couple of cooking forums I belong to highly recommend these tomatoes.  Since I couldn't find them locally (no surprise), I ordered them here.  After S&H, they were pretty expensive, so we did a 'blind taste test' between these & Progresso brand.  Progresso won!  The San Marzano were good, but not worth the price IMHO."
3,"With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of ""100 calorie"" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these."
3,"I would rate the Gran Riserva below Lavazza's Tierra! and Super Crema for sure. It isn't as flavorful as the Crema e Aroma, but is less acidic. I like(d) it better than the Qualita Oro, which is priced outrageously. For the price, the Gran Riserva also offers less value than the Pienaroma. I don't remember the Gran Riserva's characteristics that well - so it wasn't memorable, I guess. :-) Nothing much wrong with it, either. My expectations must have been high because it's called ""Gran Riserva"".<br /><br />If it was on sale, I would buy it. It's probably better than most other espresso beans; it is - after all - a Lavazza."
3,"The steaks I ordered were fine. The fish was mushy and greasy. I found a bone in one. Not my favorite. Also I don't like how fattening they turned fish. It was very high calories."
3,"This pasta is hard to cook al dente.  do not overcook or you get a mush."
3,"I found this drink interesting in terms of taste; it is watermelon juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry. Carbonation makes the juice acidic and produces stronger effect on taste buds than the fruit juice.  It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink is very interesting and it is recommended.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00113IS5E"">airforce Nutrisoda Renew, Watermelon and Blueberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br />2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012FLJDO"">FlavH2O Kiwi Watermelon Drink (Pack of 12)</a><br />3.

3,"Davidson's Raspberry Essence tea is attractively priced at under $12 a pound (July '10). This is a whole leaf black tea, not the finely chopped leaves you sometimes find in bargain-basement teas. Added to the tea are dried mallow flower petals, which are an attractive purple/blue color. The tea is organically grown.<br /><br />This is a distinctly floral tea (again, think mallow flowers) without any hints at all of fruit or raspberry to my taste buds. If you are seeking a raspberry flavor, I recommend either Celestial Seasonings Raspberry or Bigelow Red Raspberry, both herbal teas with bright, fruity flavors.<br /><br />Water above 195 degrees and steeping longer than 3-4 minutes brings out more tannins than I like when drinking without sweetener or milk. I suggest letting your water cool a minute or so after it reaches the boiling point before adding to the tea.<br /><br />Should you buy this tea? If you like floral teas (Jasmine or Lavender, for example), try it since the price is right! If you want a raspberry taste, I recommend looking elsewhere. The ""Raspberry Essence"" description does not match the flavor - and the word ""raspberry"" does not appear in the list of ingredients. I would not have purchased this tea if I had understood the floral dominance, but that may be what you want. I hope that my information helps you in your purchasing decision."
3,"Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.  It has a very, very fruity taste, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other energy drinks, but could kind of become too sweet/overpowering when I drank too many of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to other energy drinks, I do not think that this goes well with alcohol (vodka) at all.  So for normal usage, it's a solid drink, for a redbull/vodka substitute, this wasn't it, for me.<br /><br />WHITE CAN, 2 stars:<br /><br />Pros: Most tolerable when mixed with alcohol.<br /><br />Cons: This is the drink that i think has the most stereotypical awful energy drink/diet taste compared to anything else i've ever had.  It just tastes so artificial and chemical-like.  Why did I even buy this drink in the first place? for a while, it was the only diet energy drink in my university's cafeteria.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I drank hundreds of these over the past 5 or so years until finally pretty much kicking my energy drink habit and switching to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A"">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>.  I kind of miss drinking energy drinks, but 30 cents/pill vs. $2+ per drink was worth it for me... and I'll still splurge on a Lo-Carb Monster occasionally."
3,"In the box you get yer dried elbow macaroni, an envelope of ""seasoning,"" and an envelope of squishy Velveeta ""cheese sauce.""<br /><br />The box is a bit of a deception, as the contents easily would fit in a smaller box.  A bigger box conveys the expectation of a bigger end-product, right?  And of course a bigger box stands out better on the store shelf and offers a lot more copy space for that crucial moment when you have to engage and convince the consumer.  Mmmmm, pretty golden-yellow colors, and red cursive-y lettering, with a photo of noodles as big as my fingers...<br /><br />I followed the on-box instructions explicitly.  Well, okay, I admit it, I used 1.37 pounds of hamburger instead of the stated 1 pound.  All glory and praise to Odin that there were no adverse effects!  It all turned out just fine, basically just like the photo on the front of the box, neither watery/runny nor dry; everything glommed together just right.  The stated ""makes about 5 one-cup servings"" is about right.  Now, Kraft came out with the ""family size"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019RLJV2"">macaroni n' cheez</a> kit way back when, and I'd argue that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5RRA"">Velveeta</a> (a Kraft brand) would want to do the same thing, and it might even help actually fill up this oversized/underutilized box.<br /><br />I didn't add anything to the recipe, as this was the first time with the product, and I was cooking with this review in mind.  As for taste, it was just fine.  Nothing special, but not bad.  Now, did this taste like ""ultimate cheeseburger?""  No, not at all.  That's because there was no bun, mayonnaise, pickles, mustard, or grill-charred meat with a slick slab of melted cheez atop, all of the things I put on a cheezburger.  I did go with the ""customize it!"" advice on the back of the box and had some chopped onions, diced tomatoes and chopped lettuce on hand, which was a nice addition to the product, more than anything lending it some crunch, and a nicer range of flavor.  One could really go nuts and drop some salsa into the mix, or even saute' some fresh broccoli or carrots with the hamburger.  Now we're talking a meat n' cheez dinner creation that's a lot more interesting and certainly more tasty.<br /><br />If I were to use this product again--and this might be a good thing to put in the copy on the package--I'd cook some diced onions with the hamburger, and/or some chopped mushrooms.  This would bulk up the servings somewhat, and definitely yield more depth of flavor.  I added no spices to the product, and it was accordingly bland.  If I were to cook this again, I'd add salt, pepper, some caraway seeds, maybe a bit of rosemary and most definitely some garlic and a little bit of red pepper.<br /><br />Yes, it was ready in about twenty minutes, as the box copy promised.<br /><br />Yes, I'd use this product again, but I can't say I'm going to go out of my way at the store to find it and buy it.<br /><br />I do like the TV ads for this product, though, funny and original.  Let the smiting continue!<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is another offering in the great American <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IQ6"">Hamburger Helper</a> tradition.  It's a one-pan dinner that's really easy to make and takes little time.  Following the instructions yields a passable main dish that while not bad, isn't really that interesting and offers some nutritional value.  The kit does offer, however, a foundation upon which one can experiment and improvise to create more varied mealtime indulgences."
3,"AFter reading the only review for this product, I accidentally purchased these thinking it was the actual toy. These are simply the treats made for the toy, not the toy itself. My dog seemed to like them but theres nothing exceptional about them that makes up for the price."
3,"These lamps were at first look very good & bright as well as energy efficient<br />(I remember my old man would only use 25w light bulbs when we were kids as ""they saved energy and money"" - little did I know he was predicting a future path we needed to take so the hole in the ozone layer wasn't bigger than Australia)<br />Unfortunately I bought these for the purpose of using them in dimmable fixtures - to allow situation lighting as well as energy efficiency and reducing my carbon footprint.  They are labelled as dimmable on Amazon (still are as at date of this review!) and are in fact not - and as such they cannot be used in dimmable circuits without risk of fire or early failure (fire according to info I have read).  I sent them back & Amazon happily refunded my money - I will search for real dimmable flouros now..."
3,"I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee."
3,"Rabbits have been a ""must have"" for single women everywhere and almost all of my friends have one. Well, normally rabbits are upwards of $100+ dollars! Although I've heard they are SOOOOOO worth it, I could never afford one....UNTIL NOW!! I was so excited (literally) to find one under $50 that I could barely control myself as I whipped out my credit card. I opted for express shipping and then countered that additional cost by selecting a 'gently used' one! I was tingling with anticipation all day and rushed home to find my rabbit waiting on my door step. I quickly grabbed the package and dashed to my bedroom while tearing off clothing as fast as possible. I launched myself onto the bed and rip open the package and...now I can't figure out where to put the batteries!"
3,"I enjoy the nut/coconut content of this KIND bar, but do not like the calorie content.  It is very crunchy and I worry about it harming my dental work."
3,"My standard of reference for canned espresso is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZODI"">Starbucks DoubleShot Espresso Drink, 12 - 6.5 Oz. Cans</a> and this espresso does not have the bite of DoubleShot. But it has only 50 calories. So you compromise flavour for low calories."
3,"I have to agree with Dr. Pete's review below.  Up until this batch, Emeril's Big Easy was by far my favorite coffee.  To give you an idea of what my taste runs to, I also drink Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast along with an occasional Van Houtte's Honduran.  However, Emeril's was my standard cup.  But this latest bunch is nearly tasteless and watery!  It used to have a great aroma, full body, and was easily drinkable.  The only reason I didn't score it lower was because it is still not bitter or has a bad after taste.<br /><br />I am not sure what to do now.  I just put this on auto renew when I got this batch. I'm kinda' scared to keep on getting it, if it is going to stay this way. I might just cancel it and drink more Black Tiger (the most similar IMHO).  Too bad; I have frequently seen coffee quality from the same brand change in my life- and not only in the k-cups.<br /><br />Update: I tried using this on my 7.5oz instead of 9.5oz setting, and it is somewhat better.  However, it is still not nearly as flavorful as it usually was on 9.5oz.  I am really puzzled why more people have not experienced this; maybe my taste buds are growing Old? ;o)  However, my other coffees still taste the same."
3,"Although it is called ""clusters,"" this product is basically granola, so it's easier to eat with yogurt or milk than alone as a snack. The cinnamon flavor is pronounced and pleasant. There is a nice combinations of grains, and it is lowfat, which is not typical for granola. I think the price is too high, particularly for a product that is not organic."
3,"Sure disappointed with Amazon as they sent me a collection of Donut House coffee and not the Cinnamon Roll as I asked.  What is up with that?"
3,"This stuff tastes fine, but each package contained big chunks of the cereal, too big to eat with milk, but okay as a dry snack.  I had to put each pack in my food processor to break it up.  Breadshop and Bear Naked are better and less trouble!"
3,"My husband and I regularly eat crispy brown rice cereal.  Usually the stuff we buy has some kind of preservatives in it.  So when we found this we were excited and bought it on subscribe and save.  Unfortunately, it does not seem as crispy as the others.  Not sure if we are used to the preservative taste, but it was a bit disappointing.  I admit, I can't blame the cereal if that's the way its supposed to taste without preservatives.... but it also could be because Amazon sent us some old boxes."
3,"good flavors, but not fresh. powdered sugar gunked up on candy and edges are starting to turn hard."
3,"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome."
3,"The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the broth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.  If you would like to try a sampler package of this product you can access that through their website.  All the packaging is recyclable, this product is made in Thailand, and claims to be all natural:<br /><br />The chicken pot pie lists the following information:<br />Chicken, Chicken broth,Sweet Potato,Carrots,Soy bean oil,Trialcium phosphate,Tapioca Starch,Calcium Sulfate,Olive Oil, Vitamins and Minerals,Vitamin E supplement,Vitamin A supplement,Vitamin D3 supplement,Zinc Sulfate,Thiamine Mononitrate,Manganese sulfate,Menadione sodium bisuifite complex (source of vitamin K activity),Riboflavin supplement,Folic acid,Pyridoxine hydrochloride,<br />Copper amino acid complex,Iron amino acid complex<br />Carrageenan,Cholinechloride,Taurine,Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie: Protein: 12% Min.<br />Fat: 1% Min.<br />Ash: 3% Max.<br />Fiber: 1% Max.

3,"Product was shipped a little slow, also ordered the coffee maker @ the same time--which arrived 5 days  before the coffee did.<br />Product did not taste as good as our previous brand (Maxwell house/Hazelnut) or I would nave given a higher rating.<br />I will try another flavor, since this is a good value @ 21.00 for 50 K-cups."
3,"Has a taste in near red licorice but I like this a tad better.  The problem is that I don't find red licorice that good to begin with -- I'm more of a black licorice person.  It's nice that this is organic and used natural sugar, note.  Also, I shared this with my co-workers.  About 50% enjoyed it, 25% thought it was disgusting, and another 25% thought it was just okay.  Packaging is nice with shorted sticks than conventional licorice packages.  Five sticks is 130 calories.  Contains 4% calcium, 6% iron, and 1% sodium for daily percentage."
3,"If you love the SMELL of bacon coming from your microwave, this is for you.  Or if you just want a break from 'regular' popcorn, give it a try.  The TASTE isn't exactly that of bacon, but it's not a bad taste by any means.  For a more bacon-like experience, drizzle 1/3 stick of melted butter over it . . . and don't forget to take your cholesterol meds!"
3,"When I first glanced at this item, my first thought was a Nehi orange-type soft drink.  However, it is made of 100% fruit juice with carbonation added.  It tastes way too sweet for my taste buds, much more than regular OJ.  In fact, it left an aftertaste in my mouth and I had to brush my teeth right after taste-testing it.<br /><br />I ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great screwdriver with a kick of carbonation."
3,"I have just ordered this same product from Great Northern Popcorn website. It is about $30.00 cheaper than Amazon. Have not tried it yet so I don't know how it taste."
3,"I thought this would be a ""chunky"" type dog food since it is part of the description; but, it was ground. The dogs were not loving this and they had really loose stools."
3,"First let me say my cats ate this and loved it. Taste and quality are not an issue.<br />I only gave it 3 stars due to price and packaging.<br />When I opened it the tuna ooze/juice was already past the ziplock type seal.<br />I wasn't going to try to reseal it and clean the juice around the seal. I imagined that this was going to turn into a smelly mess and<br />decided to give it all to my beasts. They ate it all. The packaging really need to have the kinks worked out.<br />The price is unbelievable. The package contains 3 slices of tuna for a total of 4.1 ounces. That's $2-$3 a slice. $24-$40 a pound? Really?<br />I can't imagine why anyone would be willing to pay that price for this item."
3,"I bought the Buster Food Cube to hopefully help with my Spaniel Mix's bad habit of woofing down her meals in a couple of seconds.  I got the cube and was anxious to fill it up, however, it took a while to fill it.  Once it was filled, I put it on the floor and kicked it around for her to help her figure out what she needs to do.  She ate the kibbles as they fell, but unfortunately she's not the brightest dog ever so all she did was lick the hole where the kibble falls out and has to be put in to fill.  I think she successfully knocked it over once or twice, but gave up shortly after that.<br /><br />I think overall the Buster Food Cube has potential to be a good product for a smarter dog.  As for me, I'll just have to keep looking for solutions."
3,"Not bad but I found it has more of a ""carob"" flavor than the rich chocolate taste of the Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie mix.  I am a chocolate-lover and this product was a disappointment to my taste buds.  I tried it because I love Pamela's baking mix.  I went back to the Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - far superior taste and texture."
3,"When I first popped the candy into my mouth, I seem to be able to taste honey, even before the liquid honey center flows out. Looking at the ingredients; there are sugar, corn syrup, honey, vitamin b6, b12 and C. It does not list the percentage of sugar versus corn syrup versus honey. The distinguishable factor is the liquid honey center. But how much of that is pure honey I do not know and can only ponder.  To me, it is just another candy."
3,"I have been looking for natural food coloring-  mainly use it once a year to make green mac and cheese and other items for st paddy's day...Of course, I had to use the blue and yellow to make green and was not very successful.  I comforted myself about the ridiculously high price by telling myself you only use a drop or two at a time.  Not so- kept adding more and more and the best I could get was a light yellowish, green...Tried coloring soda bread with it and no color showed up at all after baking.  I also figured I could use it for a while but it expires in 6 months so it's not something you can keep around forever although it is something I rarely use. I would have to use it in frosting to really decide if it has any value as a colorant...this is the only reason I gave it 3 stars- because I think coloring frosting is probably it's best usage and I haven't tried that yet.  Otherwise I would have given it one star for such a poor value and results."
3,"One can buy cheaper unbranded raisins, like supermarket brands, and sometimes they actually pretty good, plum and moist as good raisins ought to be, but sometimes they are dry and crumbling, but you can't complaint because they cost you less. In contrast, raisins from sun maid bought at local stores were always good. I was unpleasantly surprised therefore to find the raisins that arrived with my order to be these same clumps of dry, low quality type of raisins as those no brand discount raisins sold in some food markets. I'm sure they still good for cooking but not for eating out of a bag. Very disappointing."
3,"As someone who only has coffee every once in a while, I love my flavia for ease of use and its single-serving mentality.<br /><br />The French Roast flavor is a solid go-to coffee. Not overly sweet like many of their flavors, but can taste a little burnt. It reminds me of basic Starbucks coffee, so if that's something you really enjoy, you'll probably like this too."
3,"This drink is healthy and will give you a slight organic buzz.  Certainly not as strong as other energy drinks, but you're not getting any chemicals or a huge load of caffeine, either.<br /><br />The downside is that the flavor isn't really appealing.  Don't expect orange.  It tastes like an earthy green tea, sweetened, with a touch of citrus.  If you like tea, you'll probably like this - but you might as well stick with tea."
3,"I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.<br /><br />I know that this is meant to be used as a pizza topping but all the summer sausages I have tried lately are very moist almost like Spam or potted meat. I like a more dry summer sausauge so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />This is very dry and solid. This is a plus for me.<br /><br />If you eat it in thick pieces like I do, it has a grainy quality to it. The spices are very strong, distinct, and unique.<br /><br />Where this loses points is the pepperoni casing that surrounds the pepperoni. In most sausages, the casing is so thin that you can't even taste it or know it's there.<br /><br />The casing on this is thick and it tastes similiar to wax paper.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again even to use on pizzas. It will take me a long time to use the two sticks I have left.<br /><br />It's a decent product but just not good to use as a meat snack. It's not worth buying it for pepperoni on a pizza, either, for me. I'll just stick to Hormel for that."
3,"The tea overall is good, but WAY too much pepper flavor for me.  It's got a real bite! I'll look for something with less pepper taste next time."
3,"My boy Cocker Spaniel has really bad allergies. I had been feeding him and his sister the Paul Newman organic food but my baby kept getting blisters on his belly and scratched like crazy. He was on steriods and antibiotics more then he was off of them. My vet suggested he may be allergic to chicken or grains. He said fish was the best protien so I switched them to Natural Balance. With the weening off the other food and the doing the old 75% to 25% then 50% to 50% (you get where I am going) they have been solely on this food for two weeks. I haven't seen a big difference in the scratching in fact the girl is scrathing now. But this food stinks. I have a strong stomach but I gag everytime I have to feed them and they stink. They mostly stay in the house during the day, I when I come home from work and open the door, my house stinks and so do they. They sleep with us at night and their breath reaks and so do they and of course they have to lay right on me.<br /><br />I am going to give it another 30 days but if the allergies do not improve this stinky food may have to go..."
3,"My daughter is lactose intolerant and she loves these cookies, I would not say they are as good as oreo's as the other reviewer say but they are pretty good and the taste is pretty good.  I ordered these with the green tea cookies from the same manufacturer.  Not bad"
3,"Not bad, lacking in spice and flavor. Would suggest adding some of your own asian spices. Also the noodles take a long time to soften."
3,"i use my handheld mixer with only 1 beater on it.  hold the jar well and there will be no splattering, it does a great job...you can really whip it up and i would imagine it does a better job than this gadget...one less thing in my drawer!"
3,"This water is good, it is possibly the best tasting of the water we had in our taste test which included several well knows brands, grocery store distilled and filtered, as well as in home reverse osmosis. But this was a side by side comparison. All the water we tasted is exceptional on its own.<br /><br />I don't personally believe any health benefits, the small difference in pH from other water seems it would quickly be equalized in the acid digestive environment.<br /><br />I did find some change in baking but it was not a improvement, the high ph seemed to interfere with yeast and pizza dough did not form a quality skin as if the gluten formation was negatively impacted.<br /><br />Conclusion, the water is good, but seems expensive without any appreciable advantage."
3,"It makes great coffee, but using this filter can burn you.<br /><br />The directions tell you to pour hot water in the top, then reach in with your fingers and unscrew the (now) boiling hot metal plate.  Other models have a slot so you can use a screwdriver.  The best don't use screws at all.  Try finding one of them before you buy this one."
3,"I have been getting ONE coconut water via subscribe and save for several months now. I loved this product until I got my most recent batch. There is now a sticker on the box over the old ingredients lable readind ""Ingredients: Organic Coconut Water, Organic Cane Sugar"" When I drank one I could taste the cane sugar in it.<br /><br />Since when did they start adding sugar to this and why does it still say pure coconut water on the inside packages and on the product page?<br /><br />Switching to one that doesn't add extra stuff to my coconut water."
3,"""The Red One"", organic baby food ""smoothie""<br /><br />If you're like me, you're interested in this item because it looks convenient and like something your baby will actually eat -- that would be a pretty good description of this product, with a few caveats:<br /><br />-The nutrition content of this product is not really that great.  We tend to mix this in with rice cereal for some iron, but otherwise it's a bit of a waste on its own.<br />-The taste is good, but maybe a little sweet for baby.<br />-The packaging is great -- very portable, screw top cap.  You tend not to waste much product with the packaging design.<br /><br />Just a reminder, the container is a bit smaller than some of the other ""bagged"" baby foods:  3 oz is less than the plastic Gerber containers (at 3.5 oz), but more than the small glass jar foods (usually 2.5 oz)."
3,"I ordered this product from Amazon, when I received it about 60% of the candy was melted in one big glob .It came with a cold pack but being put in the mail box on a day in July in the south the cold pack was boiling hot. I was very disappointed because I paid a lot for this product."
3,"This has a good hazelnut flavor, but I could not really taste the coffee at all. The flavor is just a bit strong and the coffee is on the weak side. My 18 year old daughter who is just starting to drink coffee and was not allowed to have cafeinne at all growing up, loves it. She is at the Sure I like coffee if I can add half a cup of cream and 6 teaspoons of sugar stage of drinking coffee. She does not have to add nearly that aount to this coffee and she really likes it. She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going. This is a super light blend in my opinion and I do not like super strong coffee. I am picky about flavored coffee and this one just does not taste like coffee to me."
3,"They were ok, very small and soft. Some of the figs (two from second bag I opened had so many seeds; it was like chewing glass. They are very good price, and you can keep the unopened bags fresh."
3,"I have eaten about 100 different type of food bars over the years since I don't always have time for breakfast or to leave work for lunch so when I saw these I wanted to try them out.  The picture on the box makes them look almost like a no bake cookie with lots of big oats and texture, but when I had my first one I was a bit disappointed since it was really more like a chocolate flavored sugar cookie with almost no texture.  The actual taste is mainly just a chocolate taste and the oatmeal and raisin might just barely come through on some bites.  I don't hate them, but they are certainly not my top pick."
3,"I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi."
3,"I received a bag of Barnie's Santa's White Christmas ground coffee as a stocking stuffer this Christmas and am sipping my first cup as I write this.  The flavor combination seems overdone -- ""coconut, nuts, sweet caramel, and vanilla.""  Really?  Okay, it's impossible for my taste buds to decompose the flavor concoction to discern any one of those flavor components.<br /><br />What my eyes did notice on the ingredient label, however, was sugar.  The second ingredient of this product (which granted, could be anywhere from, say, 3% all the way to 49%) is sugar.  Given that I take my coffee black unless I'm drinking crappy stuff at IHOP or Denny's, and always unsweetened, I did a double-take at the ingredients list.  But the sugar doesn't rise above the flavor concoction, which probably means the percentage is closer to 3% than 49%.<br /><br />This coffee is not substantially different from most flavored coffees, meaning the actual coffee itself seems to not be especially high quality and roasted mild so the added flavor will come through.  Unfortunately, I'm a COFFEE guy, meaning I like my coffee to taste like COFFEE.  I'm trying not to let that stand in the way of giving as objective a review as possible -- I understand that flavored coffee is intended to taste more like the flavor and less like the coffee -- but I can't entirely get past a mediocre coffee and roast.  I can't really rate this any better than a Folger's Gourmet or Millstone flavored coffee.  100% Arabica means very, very little in the coffee market anymore these days.<br /><br />My conclusion is that, as with pretty much all flavored coffee, it's not really intended to be served/taken black.  You've gotta add at least a little cream or milk, and then you can probably slam it down.  But you might want to give it a taste test before adding too much sugar."
3,"I bought these ""kcups"" to save money as the cost on my usual Kcups rose to 51 cents a cup on subscribe and save and I could not find them cheaper anywhere else online or locally. These ecocups produce a nice cup of medium strength coffee (not as strong as a regular Kcup). I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again! That's a great vaule at 38 cents a ""Kcup""!! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6"">DisposaCup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>"
3,"The Dr. Oz recommendation in a women's health magazine stated it expands in the stomach and makes one feel full.  It works, but caution, use a small amount as it makes you overly stuffed and uncomfortable."
3,"I can purchase the same dog food I mile away at Walmart. I have been ordering more from Amazon as it is difficult for me to get out. This costs more than the effort I would need."
3,"The taste and texture of these bars vaguely remind me of brownies I've gotten out of vending machines in times past.<br /><br />Taste: Vaguely fruity, mainly sweetness with dates and hints of cherry (this comes from the almonds) and yes, chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is quite weak for a ""chocolate"" bar.<br /><br />Texture: About what you'd expect from a ""health"" bar; it's a solid mass with little identifiable texture.  It's about what I'd expect a baked good to be like if you left out the leavening.<br /><br />Appearance: Errr... it's a good thing this bar isn't in a clear package, as nobody would buy it.  The choice of dutched coccoa (which is quite dark when cooked) lends an appearance that suggests a huge amount of chocolate flavor that this bar simply does not provide.  It also makes the bar look... how do I put this... like it has already been eaten and ""processed"" by your digestive system.  To be sure, it tastes quite acceptable, but if I was formulating this bar, I'd add additional standard-process chocolate, which is lighter in color, and forgo the cost benefits of the flavor-enhanced dutched cocoa (which creates a rather dark-brown product.)<br /><br />I suppose if you are a Celiac kosher-keeping vegan boycotting HFCS and Sugar that is not having intense chocolate cravings this bar might be for you.  Otherwise, get your chocolate fix elsewhere."
3,"I was a little disappointed with this product. I am a big Pamela's Products fan, but these were just ok."
3,"Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly ""olive"" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of ""crunch"".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store."
3,"I usually love Kashi products but this one caught me off guard.  They have a nice flavor but they are kind of dry and pasty.  Very hard to eat without having a drink nearby."
3,"I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter..."
3,"The chili lime salmon spread is a little on the fishy side and also a bit on the spicy side.  If you like like a bit of spice then you might enjoy it.  On a scale of 1-10, it's about a 6 in terms of spiciness.  The salmon is smashed up into a paste, so don't expect salmon filets.  The slight fishiness was a slight putoff.<br /><br />The salmon comes with a small package of 6 ""Late July"" organic crackers (90 calories, vegan) which were very good, as crackers go.  They are similar to Ritz crackers, only more of an oval shape.<br /><br />A small package of ""Sweet Perry Orchards"" ""Ginger Zip"" fruit and nut mix was part of the meal.  It includes peanuts with a crunchy ginger coating, banana chips and dried cranberries.  It's a tiny little package, not even 1 ounce.<br /><br />Also included is 1 ounce of ""Seapoint Farms"" ""Dry Roasted Edamame"".  This product is very crunchy and healthy.  While it contains 14 grams of protein, it's not very exciting but decent nonetheless.  Still, 14 grams of soy protein in only 1 ounce of edamame is pretty good nutritionally-speaking.  They are lightly salted.<br /><br />If you'd like some chocolate with your fish paste, you'll receive 0.43 ounces of Terra Nostra Organic Dark 60% Cacao.  This chocolate is darker than what I'm used to due to the 60% cacao content, but it's good.  But again, it's just one little piece, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I don't believe this that this product represents a good value at it's current price as of this writing.  I can't particularly recommend it, although some people might like it.  But the price coupled with the small size of each serving  (4.4 ounces) coupled with the fishiness of the salmon paste was not especially to my liking."
3,"Two small amount in each package to be worth the price.  Wanted to see if I liked Freeze dried fruits.  Taste was fine, but unhappy with contents.  Two expensive!"
3,"I received my vanilla beans exactly a month ago today. As soon as I opened the package I LOVED them. They were very moist and I was very pleased at the quality of the beans. I immediately used 18 of the 50+ to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans did not come with storage instructions so I googled it and read that I needed to store them in an airtight container. I've used them a few times over the past month for cooking but I still had over half the package left. Well, when I opened them this evening they were MOLDED. I am so very disappointed that I will be unable to use the rest of my beans. :( If you're able to use all 50 as soon as you get them, then I highly recommend these beans. If not, then I would look elsewhere, or order a smaller quantity."
3,"I used to love this stuff when I was young.  I remember sending away for a plastic bat & ball for a couple bucks and a few bar codes.  The gum was chopped up into fine little pieces, I recall it being in long strips of gum.  The big league chew tasted fine, I gave some of them away."
3,"I gave up drinking coffee because I always added creamer and sugar, thus I have been trying lots of different teas. This is a decent flavored tea, though not on the top of my list. Wish you could mix and match a case."
3,"I got my package in the mail today & see that it's extra fine grind so I can't use it in my coffee press. No problem as I plugged in a 4 cup coffeepot to make my first brew. What I would up with was a milder form of coffee than the bold & extra bold coffee's which is more like Breakfast Blend from that well known Seattle company. Tried my first sip black & it was ok, thankfully not bitter. Added the usual 2 spoons of suger & it tasted better but it won't be something I'll buy as it's too mild for my tastes even though I used the same amount of coffee as I always do when I made this 4 cup potfull. Couldn't taste any Hazelnut flavoring in the coffee even in that first black sip before I added sugar. All I can say (on my sencond cup as I'm writing this review) is that it's a light coffee with some body to it & that there are no unpleasant aftertaste flavors. It does seem to be weaker in the caffeine department than what I'm used to drinking but some people might like that. All in all I'll finish the bag but as I've said before I'm not going to buy this coffee for myself.<br /><br />I also couldn't get the bag open & had to cut below the seal in order to get at the coffee then I had to pour it into a coffee can I happened to have in my pantry which means I couldn't use the bag that the coffee came in as there was no way to seal the bag up after I had cut it open. So you might want to have an 11.5 oz or larger coffee can with it's lid if you order this coffee from Amazon."
3,"Ok here is the short version, I love a strong cup of coffee but I dont like french roast. So this coffee is strong and has almost no bitter after tase but it does have a french roast taste to it, so if that is what you like try this. Personally I am sticking to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHIZXE"">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>."
3,"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time."
3,"First, a confession. I typically don't drink flavored coffee, especially after learning that most flavored coffee is artificially flavored and usually is made with inferior beans. Still, I like most Starbucks coffee and welcomed their new take on flavored coffee. Opening up the bag, it smells wonderful and you can see small pieces of vanilla bean in with the coffee. I make my coffee fairly strong in a Braun drip pot. I found this coffee has some vanilla taste, but such an unpleasant aftertaste that I will finish the bag I have, but will not likely buy any more. I don't think they make this at their stores, so unfortunately you have to try a while bag to decide if you like it or not."
3,"I like my coffee strong.  At 6 oz water brew it is on the slight side of strong.  I must say it does taste very nice- smooth flavor- but if I close my eyes and try VERY hard I do  detect the slightest (and very distant) taste of cinnamon.  My friend could not tell me it had cinnamon in it when she had a cup.  Could it be that the flavor is only in some of the K cups? Simply, a nice cup of coffee (average to good)."
3,"a good, healthy product but I was sorely disappointed in the condition of the cans upon opening the package:  The 12 cans were packed in neat rows in a shallow cardboard box, and wrapped in plastic, but each and every can was dented, some quite badly.  Guess I could have returned them, but instead checked for air leaks by immersing in a tub of water and found none.  wouldn't order again.  should have been tightly packed in a smaller box to avoid shifting, I guess.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BMDF1M"">Health Valley Organic Soup, Vegetable with Salt, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"
3,"Tea snob here, so be forewarned.  If I were comparing bagged tea to loose tea, the very best bagged tea would get about 3 stars.  So, I'm comparing only bagged teas.<br /><br />This tea held a lot of promise but didn't deliver.  English Breakfast should be one of those stronger teas that has a nice robust flavor from Assam tea.  Instead, I got a mildly strong flavor with the astringent bite of Ceylon at the finish.  Ceylon?  Yep.  I could go to Lipton tea for that.<br /><br />So, what you basically have is an upscale version of Lipton tea.  I gave it three stars because, well, it's okay.  Not undrinkable.  Someone out there is bound to rave about the flavor, and that's good, because it'll show them there's more to tea than just the generic stuff.  But I really expected more, even from a bagged tea.<br /><br />If you really love this tea, start trying loose teas.  There are plenty of companies out there that provide some great black teas.  Adagio is one, but not the only one.  Try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4JS8"">Adagio Teas English Breakfast, 4-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>  Much better stuff."
3,"Excellent coffee flavor - robust without being bitter.  I'd give this a five star rating were it not for the amount of grounds and sludge that are produced.  Don't drink the last quarter of your cup!"
3,"I eat a lot of seaweed, and a ton of nori. This particular brand, at least the bag I received, tastes very seaweed-y, fishy. I've had a lot better but the price here is great and the taste doesn't keep me from eating it. Just be aware."
3,"It might seem ridiculous to have some dandruff as well as oily hair. My hair gets oily in about 3 days. I try to not wash more than every 3, to not dry out my hair on the ends. This means I do get some dandruff.<br /><br />I opened this shampoo and was immediately in love with the scent. So fresh and clean smelling! I was excited to use it on my hair. The shampoo alone did a nice ob, but it left my hair a little lacking after rinsing. If I hadn't had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one. I used it mainly on my scalp, working it very good. I worked it through the ends.<br /><br />After air drying, my hair was shiny and silky. However in a day, I noticed more oil than normal on my scalp and hair near my roots. In 2 days, I found myself needing to wash my hair, when typically I can do another day. So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the shampoo, it wasn't a good fit for me on a regular basis."
3,"We only waited one week for 2 cases.<br />The cans were not in the best shape, though.  The cases got pretty beat up in shipment.  Many cans were dented, but none were leaking or unuseable.  Best price on-line that I have found.  Right on track with the best price I have found in discount stores with tax.  I would order again knowing that it will be one week or more."
3,"I was looking for White Acre Peas and the search sent me to Pigeon Peas. Not even close. Pigeon Peas are more like Black Eyed peas with a more woodsy taste. And Pigeon Peas take forever to cook. They were ok but I will not buy them again. It is easier to get a can of black eyed peas and season."
3,"If you want a lot of ""pow!"" in the way of salt and vinegar....this is not your bag of chips.  By that I mean that the malt vinegar flavor is fairly subtle.  It has a slight sweetness like you'd figure from malt vinegar.  The chips are nice and crispy, however smallish, which is fine for a small bag as such.  Overall...good flavor, salty enough, slightly tangy/sweet.  I shall very much enjoy the remainder of the case I bought, but may try a case of something else in seek of something with a little more bang.  Having said that, I appreciate that they use real malt vinegar solids and sea salt. Unlike some ""kettle type chips"" that use cheap acid variants that simulate the salt and vinegar flavor, but leave your mouth and tongue feeling like you swabbed your mouth out with sandpaper.<br />If you like Salt and Vinegar chips, they are certainly worth a try to see if they fit your taste."
3,"I must say I was dissapointed in the last batch of Bigelow Earl Grey tea.  The tea itslef was fine, good flavor.  But the tops would come un-sealed on several of the k-cups and make a mess while brewing.  I still love my Keurig and will continue to enjoy other brands of k-cup teas."
3,"Read the on-line reviews of this product prior to purchase... Have had the taste of Carolina barbeque foods on more than one occasion (enjoyed!) ... Thought we'd try Duke's mayo based on it's enthusiastic following... Found the taste to be very good, above average... Better than our usual brand but not extraordinarily so... The negative was that the product is too soupy... After using Duke's mayo to make cole slaw dressing, for example, it had to be drained of liquid prior to serving... Other sauces, etc. too soupy, runny.... Will stick with Best Foods real mayonaise..."
3,"Good steaks, Delivery was a little delayed though..<br /><br />purchased onsale. Not overly impressed... I consider myself somewhat of a steak Connoisseur having dined at some of the finest steak houses in the country servering USDA prime beef. I can't put my finger on it (perhaps it was my own preparation) but I've had fresh (not frozen) choice Black Angus steaks locally which I enjoyed better..."
3,"My girls love raisins as a snack, so we have these on subscribe and save.  Our first batch was perfect- juicy, soft, and sweet raisins.  Kids ate them up.  This shipment, however, I have been disappointed.  Every box we've opened has been full of dry, hard, and very light colored raisins.  They still get eaten, but I'm hesitant to order again."
3,"I love Kettle Corn, so, although I'm not much of a snack person, decided to give this a try.  It's perfectly fine combination of popcorn, caramel and chocolate.  They did a good job of making sure one taste didn't overpower.  It's a little salty for my taste and does contain 190 mg of sodium.  I was also a bit alarmed that the very first ingredient was ""brown sugar,"" even before the popcorn - and I noticed a faint aftertaste.<br /><br />That being said, it's a nice snack and a nice size if dinner is late and you need a pick-me-up.  A lot of reduced-calorie foods taste like it, and this did not.  I probably won't buy it very often, but it was worth trying."
3,"I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium."
3,"I was looking for long, stringy shreds of coconut, like Baker's Premium Shred used to be -- and which apparently no longer exists. These alleged ""shreds"" are tiny coconut chips about like what you find mixed in the middle of a Mounds bar, minus all the sugar and other candy goop. It's what years ago we used to refer to in the food-service business as ""dissected"" coconut -- grated, yes, shredded, no. I've used many Bob's Red Mill products and liked them all. We'll use this, but it is a real disappointment. Perhaps I didn't read the description well enough before buying."
3,"""Van Houtte Cr&egrave;me Brul&eacute;e Coffee"" is OK once in awhile, but I wouldn't buy it on a regular basis. 3 stars.<br /><br />""Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee"" is a notch above this one.<br /><br />But I recommend ""Van Houtte Cafe, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast) Coffee"", it's not flavored, but it's my favorite right now."
3,"I have read countless articles about the health benefits of cacao nibs and was excited to purchase these. I even ripped open the bag upon receiving the product from Amazon excited to get my chocolate fix! However, after stuffing a small handful into my mouth expecting a chocolatey taste, I was surprised at the bitter almost coffee like taste (similar to the dregs at the bottom of an espresso). Bottom line, I am not a fan of the taste. I have Googled a bunch of recipes about how to consume this product besides eating it raw and the only ones that I can stomach are those involving adding either sugar or Splenda. A heads up to those out there that are expecting these nibs to taste like dark chocolate shavings because you will be sorely disappointed."
3,"Ok raw hides, but good deal. Better for adult dogs, I have a large breed puppy and he wasn't crazy about them."
3,"Starbucks used to have an Ethiopian Sidoma that I loved but no longer serves it. Full bodied but smooth, the only coffee I ever loved without cream or sugar.  Unfortunately, this grind did not meet the mark.  I was disappointed but it's still a decent coffee."
3,"It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner"
3,"OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat."
3,"This syrup is a terrific product!  It has just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  Instead of having to wait for Starbucks to bring it back out in the fall, you can make your own Pumpkin Spiced Lattes at home!  However, you can get this exact bottle of syrup on the Torani website for literally HALF the price! The bottle is 7.95 and the shipping is 5.95. You do the math."
3,"Which, of course, if you REALLY like EXTREMELY sweet things, you would probably rate this five stars! I just think it's too over the top between the caramel and the chocolate drizzle. The chocolate is okay tasting; not the best. It will certainly satisfy your sweet craving for 130 calories in the individual package. I do like, however, the fact that there is no high fructose corn syrup in this product. Although there is brown sugar and corn syrup. If you really want sweet, by all means, have at these ~ you will most likely really enjoy them!"
3,"OMG! *Another* Vine review of Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twists?  Yeah...<br /><br />Anywho, I'm going to start off by saying: My wife really likes these.  She finds the flavor prevalent but not overpowering and the sweetness isn't cloying like Red Vines.<br /><br />I'll follow that up by saying: I adore Red Vines, I loathe Twizzlers, and these are somewhere in-between.<br /><br />To the reviewer who wrote:  ""they had a kind of weird wheat flavor and heavier texture, which is not the kind of thing you want to taste when you're thinking red licorice"" I can only say: I 100% agree. I grab a licorice twist and I want that sweet, chewy Red Vines (or even Black Vines) experience.  These do *not* deliver that.  While they do manage to stick to your teeth, they're not particularly chewy; they're somewhere closer to a crumble than a chew.<br /><br />And I was expecting to be wowed by tart pomegranate flavor.  I was completely let down.  The flavor is mild, at best... and reminds me of pomegranate, but not overly so.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd have rated these 1 star, but since the wifey loves them, I'm upping it to 3. Like Twizzlers?  You'll probably like these."
3,"This is a great Taco Bell sauce for sandwiches, tacos, gorditos, chalupas, and even burritos. While the manufacturer likens it to a ranch dressing, it is not a great dressing for your standard salad -- unless it's a taco salad. In my opinion, the ranch flavor is a bit mild and the spices could use a little more of a kick. I still like it though, and I think adding it to the aforementioned foods gives them that little bit extra. I put some on a meatloaf sandwich I made today, and the flavor reminded me of eating a taco. I wish it didn't have so many additives and unnecessary ingredients though.<br /><br />Bold & Creamy is a fun addition to condiments for a Mexican themed meal. It has a creamy Taco Bell flavor reminiscent of their fast food that you either like or don't. How it works with other culinary styles will depend on the dish you are making, though I found it to play nice with chicken dishes. The bottom line though is that you can make a much healthier and fresher tasting version of your own, given a little extra time and the right ingredients. For a quick fix though, Bold & Creamy isn't bad.<br /><br />~ Kort"
3,"These would have been sooooo good if they had about half of the amount of pepper on them.  I will order again in another flavor.  The pepper was just too much, too spicy.  It hurt my tongue.  I keep wanting to eat them b/c they do taste good but then I start gagging over the pepper.  I need to find a pepper loving friend to give them to.  I enjoyed the consistency and can't wait to try another flavor!"
3,"The seasoning is too heavy. I will eat them, but only because I ordered a bunch."
3,"We've been having a couple raccoons stopping by each night and foraging around the plants and trash, so we've been looking for a deterrent to keep them from getting too  comfortable and deciding to hang out.  We didn't want to trap or hurt them, or use anything with chemicals that would be bad for the plants and animals, so this Critter Ridder seemed like a good choice since it's apparently all natural and unharmful.  Apparently, it just stinks really bad to animals yet isn't bothersome to us humans.  But I  think we went a bit haywire with it because it's a 5lb canister and we used a bit over half of it for a relatively small area.  Supposedly, the canister is good for multiple applications to a mid sized area, but I doubt that, given how much we used for just 1 application.  But it seems to be doing the trick, because our security cams caught the raccoons steering clear from where we sprinkled the Critter Ridder.  The only downside I see, is this stuff is it's quite expensive for something that needs to be reapplied every 30 days, or sooner, if you water the area often or it rains.  If you had to keep this up regularly, it would cost quite a bit over the course of a summer, especially if you're trying to cover a larger area.  I'm just hoping the raccoons learn to stay away and forage elsewhere before we run out and need to buy more of this expensive stuff.  Fingers crossed.<br /><br />Bottom Line - works well enough but costs too much to be practical."
3,"Given the claims of the manufacturer I was expecting this to be a really good tasting bottled water. In reality, not so much - it tastes rather flat with a hint of a chalky aftertaste (which I'm assuming is due to the baking soda that is added, as listed in the ingredient list on the bottle). Not horrible, but not great either.<br /><br />I think the price is outrageous for bottled water, but I didn't factor that into my rating - it gets three stars strictly on the basis of how it tastes, which is not nearly as good as the tap water that I filter at home."
3,"Amazon doesn't list the ingredients of this, but it does contain lots of high fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup.  Corn syrup, especially the high fructose variety, is quite bad for you.  It's cheap for manufacturers, that's partly why they use it.  I'm disappointed in Heinz about his.  Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.<br /><br />Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.  This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no-no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE-inhibitor family especially).<br /><br />I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this.  Maybe I tried, I forget.  At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label:<br />""INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING.  * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP""<br /><br />Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order.  It came as loose bottles in a box.  Also, there was a barcode/description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle.  This was probably for internal Amazon purposes.  I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful."
3,"This is marketed as ""thin style"", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars."
3,"I'm going to give this an ""ok"" or ""thee star"" review because it was edible...it is Velveeta but it sure isn't what I expected.  The box should of said, ""just add chicken AND BROCCOLI"" because you sure didn't get any in the box!  The ""Velveeta"" cheese that we as consumers are familiar with is the same, but the ""added"" broccoli makes you think you will get a small can inside, not flakes.  I must be honest, I wouldn't purchase this again in a store, I would just stick with the regular cheese and noodles from Velveeta!"
3,"I bought this last month and I've been trying it ever since and it tastes good with a decent flavor ,but nothing special ... before this I used the 8 o'clock colombian coffee beans (11oz x 4 bags) I grinded them myself and brew them ,I have to say the difference is huge ,with the 8 o'clock coffee you feel the flavor right away ,every sip it's like a taste of heaven (at least to me) ,I changed to this brand because I thought it was a pretty good deal and since it was ground coffee ,i said ok it can't be that bad ..but now I regret it ,I should've sticked with the 8 o clock coffee ...now I'll have to wait 2 more months til I'm done with this one *sigh*  ...overall if you want an ordinary and economic coffee buy this ,if you want an extraordinary coffee then buy the 8 o' clock coffee  ,you'll pay a little extra and have to grind it yourself but believe me is totally worth it."
3,"this brand is just ok, Lindt is better.  I love the flavor and will get this again, pear brandy is great, I wish we had more of  here in the US."
3,"It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner"
3,"To begin with, I wasn't able to find any tapioca balls at the Asian market near my house. Every time I went and asked they would look at me funny, like if I were going to steal there products. Eventually I ordered them online.... The product is great but the shipping is too much money. Not really worth buying online. I'm trying to save money and in total I spent $9 something with shipping and handling. Is $2.50 really cheap? NO. just try to go to a store better."
3,"These were good chips, but they were a month away from expiration (with no preservatives) when they arrived.  I was expecting them to be good for longer considering it was a pack of 12 bags.  I like chips, but not enough to eat 1.2 bags a day.<br /><br />5* for the chips<br /><br />1* for Amazon selling borderline stale chips"
3,"The storage drawer came in on time just like the shipping message said it would and the product was in good condition but I am not completely satified with this drawer.  Although the drawer holds a good number of K-cups and it does save counter space because it fits under the Keurig it is alittle too small for the K-cups to fit properly.  And every time the drawer is opened or closed the K-cups get all twisted and struck in the drawer so it doesn't shut right.  Plus the drawer squeaks everytime it is opened or closed quite loudly, it doesn't slide as easily as I thought it would.  If I had to do over I probably would not purchase this product."
3,"These came in the variety pack <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AZ2ECY"">Gourmet Basics Smart Fries 6-Flavor Variety Pak, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>, and out of the six were my least favorite.  The fries were a nice crunch and puffy texture as with all the others.  The sharp, salty cheddar flavor was good.  However, the flavoring was too weak for my taste, especially when compared to the other varieties in the assortment."
3,"I purchased this as a gift and the recipient said the coffee was good but not as good as other Kona they had tasted."
3,"My dog loves these, and they used to be great but the last batch we got were limp and stale. When I try to break them, they bend instead of snap like they usually do. And when finally after a lot of fighting, I could get it to break (really more by having to rip them), the result was a big crumbly mess. Usually I would go through a jar of these rather quickly. Needless to say, this last jar I bought has been sitting here for a few months, because it's such a pain in the butt to deal with. He still loves them, but I don't feel like having to clean up a mess every time he has some, and I also don't like the thought of giving my dog something that's not fresh. Makes me skeptical to purchase again, because they aren't cheap and Amazon does not let you return food items. So now, instead I just stick to the Plato Chicken Strip Cookies that come in the bag. He loves those too. They are highly palatable, and I love the fact that plato's treats have very few, clean simple ingredients since my dog has had allergy issues in the past. The sticks were just a nice change from the regular old crunchy cookie that most snacks are (the shape and texture and all) but oh well, too bad!"
3,"I don't dislike Special K, and I don't dislike their Red Berries cereal. You will not however see me purchasing this item for my household again. As far a health-wise, it doesn't win big in my book. It is essentially just processed rice, sugar and wheat with freeze dried strawberries. Just a bunch of empty calories that don't provide much of any nutritional value. Almost all the vitamin and minerals are artificially added. Also they added fiber isolate to boost the fiber value, but realize that studies have started to show that these processed fiber adds don't act in the body like natural fiber. Really the healthiest part is probably the freeze dried strawberries, but in my opinion they taste terrible in comparison to fresh strawberries which would take a total of 1 minute to prep and add to your bowl. I do want to restate that the taste isn't bad, but there are much better tasting cereals out there. In all fairness my normal cereal the I will eat on occasion is Frosted Mini Wheats, but some people my find them to grainy or not sweet enough."
3,"Brew style: french press, espresso<br />Smell: Nothing special here, decent 'coffee' smell with some earthiness.  No caramel notes, no sweetness.<br />Taste: Mild, earthy, somewhat smokey, dirty mouth feel, finish is short.<br /><br />I mostly brew with a french press but i tried it in my espresso maker just to see how it would fair.  The caffeine seemed very pronounced to me, there was no sweetness to speak of.  It did have a very nice crema though.<br />Overall: I wont be buying this again, its nothing special."
3,"I tried this and the Donut Shop blend coffee; the donut shop blend is a lot better (although I enjoy the Coffee People blend a lot more).  I do not think I will be buying this again, you can smell the chocolate but there is not much there for taste.  I was a little disappointed; my favorite donut is the chocolate glazed donut; this does not really make me think of it at all."
3,"I was really hoping the kids would take to these so I'd have a new product to add to their school lunches, but, they didn't care much for them at all.  (15, 11, and 5 years old)  The bars are dense and chewy with a few almonds tossed in. While they are supposed to be chocolate, they have a tangy, slightly sour taste that tends to be the first thing I notice.  The kids and I are gluten-sensitive, and on the box it clearly states that they are gluten free, but also that they are ""produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, sesame, tree nuts"".  I'm extremely sensitive and often react to slight cross contamination, but I had no problem with these bars.  All in all, I might buy this flavor for myself as an occasional switch from my usual Larabar."
3,"I ordered these because I had purchased a bag of Sweet maui Onion chips from the supermarket. They were so good that I had to get another.<br /><br />The order came and I popped open a bag. They are very crunchy, so if you're into that, these are the chips for you. However, they do tend to get really salty. I found myself having quite a few sips of beer when eating these"
3,"Nothing wrong with this coffee just not exceptional. Love Sunset Blvd from Urban City but this wasn't any better than much cheaper dark roast coffees"
3,"the seller was fast to ship and at this time the plant looks ok .... but it is way to large for such small pot roots were all taped to the side of the pot ... and i broke many trying to remove all the tape and now i am not sure it will live ... we will see"
3,"I am a fan of Arm and Hammer products including some of their cat litters but the odor emanating from this stuff is<br />way too intense !"
3,"This tea is fine. It is not anything special, but certainly better than anything in a teabag. It is more than worth the price."
3,"While I love Bit a Honey and don't regret my purchase, I did not find them as ""fresh and soft"" as the other reviewers. They arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth. Maybe it's because I bought the bags of individually wrapped Bit a Honey's as opposed to the actual candy bars. Next time it's the bars!"
3,"this stuff does what it is suppose to do but not much in the bag for the price.  i think i will start making my own"
3,"This creamer tastes like regular Coffeemate. Not enough cinnamon to convince me it's even flavored. I make up trays of various flavored creamers for a group every week and this is the least used one of the bunch."
3,"The coffee itself is awesome.  Good, strong taste.  It is the only kind I order.  However, I counted the k-cups this time since the box you see is all they come in.  They are dumped in there.  I decided to count them this time and I only received 45 k-cups not 50.  I called Amazon and they refunded me 10% which is what the 5 cups were worth.  I feel they should have done a little more for the trouble, but I won't make a deal out of that.  Just make sure you count them when you open the box."
3,"One packet is only good for 6 cups, not a full pot as the directions state. If you put in any more water, the coffe is too weak."
3,"This is ok coffee, I love their donut shop coffee, but this jet fuel is very unique and I am not a fan (were they going for a fuel-y taste?).  I like Green Mountain Dark Magic much better for just very strong, not as bitter taste.  I don't plan on purchasing again."
3,"This soup was much thinner than I expected.  I also agree about the lack of a visible expiration date, although with dried beans and spices the worst result would be blandness.  Fair value for what was received, but not worth buying again."
3,"The coating of saponins is not completely washed off of Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa leaving it a little bitter. Ancient Harvest does a much better job of washing it off as evident by just tasting a little of each of the uncooked quinoa. Unfortunately Ancient Harvest doesn't do as good as job removing stems and grit from their product. I also prefer the packaging of Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa so usually buy it despite the slight bitterness."
3,"This Breakfast Blend is just OK!!  I have been trying to find a K-cup that I really really enjoy.  I'll just have to keep trying.  However, I truly appreciate Amazon's Terrific Service...  Thanks Amazon ~ Keep  up your GOOD WORK!!!"
3,"The box describes these as ""chewy granola bars"", but in my mind, ""granola"" implies lots of oats or other grains.  ""Crisped rice"" makes up the main portion of the bar.  Then there's the use of corn syrup as a sweetner.  Not good.  As far as the ""triple nut"" claim goes, the bar contains mostly peanuts.  A few almonds were identifiable.  According to the label, there should also have been cashews, but I wasn't able to spot any.  The taste of peanuts masks any other nut flavors that may be present.<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't make this my first choice for snacking.  The bars are high in calories (200 per bar) and pack a whopping 12g of fat."
3,"My first impression is that the scent is nice. It's a clean soapy scent but not as strong as Irish Spring or some of the other men's body washes out there.<br /><br />The problem is that it is way too gritty/grainy.  For a body wash whose description focuses on moisture and ""skin comfort"" and is also meant for use on your face, I was a little surprised that it was so abrasive.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good exfoliant it might be a good choice but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a moisturizing facial wash that promotes skin comfort.  I think the product description/marketing is all wrong.  Had I been looking for a super clarifying exfoliant I think I would have been pleased."
3,"I have one of those popcorn machines.  It is a West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper that I purchased here.  It is one of those popcorn poppers that actually uses corn oil and is not a cheap ""air"" popper.  Anyway, I tried a few different brands of popcorn, and by far, the best is the Orville Redenbacher yellow in the jar.  This stuff is not too bad, but after having the Orville for a few weeks, just did not cut it in my opinion.  It popped up big and fluffy, but there were a fair number of hard pieces and they had me worried for my teeth.  You get a lot less of that with the Orville popcorn.  This was very good value for the price, but seeing how long popcorn lasts, I'd rather pay a fair bit more for something better."
3,"As raven wrote, these bites are not chewy nor are they extra chewy as the package states.  In fact, these bites are just a tad softer than some rocks.  They are approximately an inch long and shaped like a bone with a pink filling (I bought the bacon-flavored version).  I cut them - a feat in itself - into 6 pieces to use as training treats.  My puppy does like them, but she is in the middle of losing her baby teeth and she can't chew them that well.  She takes awhile eating 1/6th of a bite.<br /><br />I am soaking a couple of bites in water to see if they will soften up so my puppy doesn't have to gum the pieces for 5min."
3,"The package is marked as wonton flavored, but the flavor package inside is marked as prawn flavored. The flavor has a strong fish smell, but as I only use about half the flavoring, it tasted ok."
3,"I bought this product hoping that perhaps my finicky Chihuahua would eat it, but... no, she didn't. I did feed it to our other Chihuahua and Dachshund - who will eat anything. Wouldn't buy again due to cost of product and shipping."
3,"A week after enjoying the mints, I had chest pains, and about the same time, FDA gave a warning of health hazards of liquorice root extracts. I have quit using Altoids Liquorice flavored mints."
3,"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CEABE"">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 5 Pound Bag</a> more than this flavor, and I suspect my pooch does too. We have similar tastes, is what I'm trying to say. The beef and fish meal gives her the worst fish breath imaginable. I don't know if the food causes her to want to try giving me face kisses more than normal, but every time she gets near me after eating this her breath is like a shotgun of stank."
3,"Years ago, the Devonsheer Rounds were the best Sesame Crackers out there.  They are really hard to find these days.  Ordered them on Amazon and find they are no longer as great as they used to be and the Old London Sesame Rounds are by far the better cracker."
3,"I have fine, straight hair and the Therapy made my hair really heavy.  My daughter has thick, wavy hair and it worked well on her hair to keep it less fuzzy while remaining shiny.  Probably wouldn't buy it again because it didn't make enough of a difference.  It did have a great smell though."
3,"I must admit I am absolutely ""crackers"" over these organic nibbles; I am, however, extremely disappointed in the price. Altho I had been unable to find them locally and did order on-line, I have rececently discovered them in my area and they are half the price I paid thru this website.  I will continue to really like the product but I will never buy thru the website again.  Even with taxes and having to pick them up at the store, they are less expensive at the local level."
3,"Bought as a gift. Price seemed great but the licorice seems very hard. Will see if the recipient is satisfied or not."
3,"A few weeks ago I picked up a couple noodle bowls that I can keep in the pantry for occasional lunches or things like that. One was the Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup Hot and Spicy (Beef Flavor). It's real easy to prepare and I just follow the simple instructions. I use the microwave method and it's ready in a matter of minutes, The flavor is good. It's spicy, but not overly so. Strangely, although it doesn't seem overly spicy to the taste, if I inhale the fumes it irritates my nasal passages somewhat. I have had to learn to eat it without inhaling. The sodium is high so I don't like to have things like this very often and I'm careful of sodium the remainder of the day. The protein content is too low for a complete meal, so I add a few protein items. Today, I added a couple pieces of beef jerky. All in all, I'd say it's one of the better beef-flavored bowls I can remember. It's good to have a few handy things like this around but I wouldn't want them to become a major part of my diet..<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
3,"Both of my finicky yorkies love this treat, but I don't!  It smells awful and I have to hold it for them to enjoy it, unlike other treats that I toss to them and let them enjoy while I enjoy a little peace and quiet.  Also, the liquid gets in their ""beard"" so the odor of the treat lingers even after I tuck the bottle back in the treat cupboard.  It is rare for both of my dogs to agree on a treat and it is fun to watch them enjoy it, but it is inconvenient.  I will not likely repurchase this."
3,"My dog is a finicky eater and in the stores when I bought the packets that come 4 flavors to a box, my dog loved the chicken and the turkey but none of the other flavors so buying just one box full of the flavor he liked seemed perfect. However, I had not fully read the ingredients before making the purchase. The good part is that it is all meat with no grains and my dog seems to have an allergy to many things which makes him finicky. BUT it has onion powder and garlic powder. Now these may make it taste better and the dog seems to enjoy but it also causes damage to his already weakened liver. Had I read the ingredients fully before even as finicky eater I would not have purchased because I know onion in any form is very dangerous to little dogs. Garlic not much better but worse for one with weakened liver already. So after having a package or two of his favs, he got sicker and has gastritis terrible..  had to go to vet and is still recovering so won't be using the rest of the packages.<br /><br />Read full ingredients before giving anything to your little guy and be sure he's able to digest these products.<br /><br />Now I just buy ground turkey and ground chicken, or whole, cook it up myself and give it to my little guy making certain there is nothing in the food that can cause him severe illness."
3,"Tastes great and I like to spread it over salad.  I would have preferred more cherries in the packet.  I usually buy a bag of raisins or cherries to go with it.  That's why I give it 3 stars instead of 4.  The price is not bad either.<br /><br />Janel"
3,"I haven't had a chance to call the company to ask about overseas product in this, but I will.<br />I like these because it's easy to cut them into small training size treats. If I can find out if it's all USA source ingredients I'll give these treats a 4.5."
3,"The valerian taste is a bit strong in this blend, it adds a odd sweetness.  The few times that I did make a cup it did help lull me to sleep.  But, I think I might stick with my other blends."
3,"Its not bad! It is more of a mental thing to me. Its taste like regular water when cold but when at room temperature you can taste a something different. Im happy with my purchase."
3,"I am a bit disappointed to find so many of the red berries in the product.  The ratio of them to actual peppercorns is a bit out of whack."
3,"I really wanted to like this formula because it claims to be organic and gets good reviews. We used it for several weeks while our baby had crying sessions after every feeding. We received a sample pack of Enfamil Lipil in the mail out of the blue and decided to try it, and our baby has had much better feedings ever since. So Lipil it is. Over the weekend we tried Similac Organic and it looks an awful lot like Earth's Best, and again our baby has had stomach problems and gas."
3,"a bit pricey but great sweetness and you just need to add a touch...we use it in our coffee."
3,"Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work."
3,"I have been buying these for my coonhound and retriever. They love them as in they can go through one a day. When I first started buying them a couple of months ago they were $1 a piece, now doubled in price. I can no longer afford their rawhide habit. I have switched to natural bones, cheaper and probably healthier. These are NOT made in USA but Central America."
3,"I received the plant in great condition but soon killed it. The directions said not to fertalize it and exactly what to plant it in. So, I bought exactly what it said but did not pay attention to the fact that the medium had rapid gro in it so it died within 3 days. My seven year old loved it while he had it though. He even named it, fed it and took care of it as if it were a life pet!"
3,"Tea smells fantastic, but there was not a great deal of taste.  No complaints at the price I paid, but if it had been full price, I would have been dissapointed."
3,"This new product attacks dry, damaged hair by treating your ""hair-soil""; your scalp. It seems to be working. ""Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Conditioner"" is a vitamin/nutrient compound bursting with healthy additives. As with all hair conditioners, be careful not to over-use the product, as oily conditioners can swamp and strangle hair follicles, creating hair distress. This conditioner has ten vitamins and nutrients, including Vitamin C, Vitamin E, sunflower, soybean, and coconut oils. An internet search reveals that healthy, fast-growing hair can be stimulated by Vitamin B6 and b12. ""Clear Scalp Therapy"" contains Vitamin B5."
3,"The best thing about these is the smell when you first open the bag - pure white cheddar goodness.  Too bad they don't taste like that.  The first few are good, but when I ate more than 5 or 6 'puffs', I got an acidic taste in my mouth.  At that point, most of the cheddar flavor went away.  If you're ok with eating one small handful of these, by all means, buy away - you'll be pleased.  Otherwise, they're just ok, not great.  At least they're not as bad for you as other snacks of this type."
3,"The case of Pickapeppa arrived within normal limits, but two of the bottles leaked.  At $5.00 per bottle, that hurts."
3,"I must say that my 3yr old and I have really enjoyed watching our Aerogarden grow.  It really is a lot of fun, and it's the first time that my 3yr old ate lettuce.  She has always refused to eat lettuce but I'm guessing  that actually planting it and watching it grow has encouraged her to try it.  So the garden is worth it from that point, but from a seasoned lettuce eater - yuck.  The lettuce is limp meaning there is nothing crisp about it at all.  It also has no taste.  I have tried a few different leaves from the garden and it doesn't taste like anything.  Maybe that's why my daughter likes to eat it.  My seeds are new so that's not the problem.  It's just tasteless and limp."
3,"before you buy this, make sure you do your research first.  it may be potent- good and bad for you."
3,"Oddly, the tea bag wrappers are paper instead of the usual foil used for the very same Stash tea when purchased in the supermarket.  We assume that this will have a negative bearing on tea leaf freshness."
3,"These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold."
3,"I enjoyed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Coffee. I wish it was whole beans instead of grounds, but that's ok... it still tasted fresh. I did find, however, that it wasn't very tasty until I put what I consider to be too much sugar in it. Typically, I only put a tablespoon, but I had to put 3-4 in this because it had an unusual taste to it. It may be that I associate vanilla with sweet, but I thought it was worth mentioning."
3,"The plant came very healthy but smaller then described. It was described as a large Venus fly trap I received a medium size Venus fly trap but it was a healthy one even fed before it was shipped being that I paid a reasonable price for it's unexpected size I don't believe I loss on this one in fact I am pleased with the plant."
3,"This is marketed as ""thin style"", which is quite appropriate.  The thinness of this jerky gave it more of a paper type consistency, which, for my family, really robbed us of some of the jerky texture and chewiness that we so much enjoy.  If you prefer thin jerky, then you'll probably fairly happy with this.  We'll stick with traditional jerky from now on regardless of the price.  The taste was OK - again, not great, but certainly acceptable.  It was good enough that our whole family would welcome it as a snack.  If we enjoyed this style more, I'd have given this 4 stars."
3,"Potatoes were good. Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol. (not Omaha's fault)"
3,"This is a good buy but did notice it didn't taste as good as the smaller count box decaf. These tasted like they were overly roasted. I will not buy the 50 ct anymore."
3,"My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks.  I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay.  After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled.  I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training."
3,"The jury is still out on this item. Perhaps it will take a little more time to feel the positive effects in my joints.  Easy to drink, though."
3,"I love Jelly bellys.  So when I saw an offer for buy 3 bags of flops and get one free, I was excited.  Unfortunately between the 4 bags, eight pounds, there were only about 8 flavors.  Next time I will just buy premium jelly beans."
3,"These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin."
3,"Personally I thought the rice balls sort of reminded me of tapioca balls you get in those smothies, they kind of burst when you bite into them.  I will not be purchasing any more of the rice, I will however be buying a lot more of the noodles.  The noodles are very similar to pasta noodles.  Makes a very nice quick easy pasta.  I only wish I could get it like a lasagna noodle."
3,"What? This product is NOT what is showed in the photo. Instead of the box of Xtra Sour Goo which was shown, I recieved Monster Goo, which is NOT what I wanted to get. This company does not send you exactly what is in the photo, so watch out."
3,"These are a staple on my grocery list from Amazon (I get two boxes a month on the ""Subscribe and Save"" program, and often have to ""send next shipment now"" because I share them with friends at work).  However, I've become alarmed when I open the newer boxes / packages- the bars are at least an inch shorter than they used to be.<br /><br />I thought maybe I had a few from the ""end of the roll"" or something, but it seems rather consistent now.  The cellophane wrapper is the same size, but the bars are missing at least a full bite of what the bars used to be.  And the prices keep going up.  I like these, but at some point the decreased ""value"" will get to a point where I'll find something else to snack on."
3,"I usually drink spring water. This one taste like a tap water and I could only drink it when very chilled. The warmer it got the worse it tasted. It is basically tap water purified with added minerals.<br />Due to high ph number it taste very smooth, heavy and thick. It didin't feel refreshing to me at all. It's not the worse I've tried, it beats for instance Las Vegas tap water;)<br /><br />It will be good for someone who prefers this type of water. I don't so this is why only 2 stars."
3,"it would have been good only the expiration date was over due by about 10 months<br />but the dog loved them anyway they should really keep an eye on those dates for sure<br />Marielle"
3,"Love this tea! However it is half the price on other reputable websites.  Despite other reviews I am unable to find it in stores for the price I pay online.  Making it yourself is much cheaper than at Starbucks, now I can have it everyday!"
3,"I also bought this giving the company the benefit of the doubt, but was disappointed.  While I had a decent variety of hot cocoa, cappucino, tea, and even cider, there were only 3 true flavored coffees.  And I received about 15 bold/intense blend coffees with no flavor, just different makers.  To me, that isn't real variety.  And I'm not going to drink them so it was a waste of money.  I do realize you always take a chance when ordering something that clearly tells you it's up to the distributor so I fall back to that, but I agree with the other reviewers.  If you are looking for flavored coffee variety, this isn't it."
3,"Unfortunately, these Os have a terrible aftertaste, something akin to a vitamin flavor.  I'm not sure why.  Sadly, my kids will not eat them."
3,"Lots of powdery stuff at bottom of package. Bananas were a bit soft and not very crunchy."
3,"This is a very good brand of popcorn, but what we received from Amazon was quite a bit tougher than what we get from the local grocery store. Kinda sorry I bought it.<br /><br />By the way, it's just plain popcorn; I don't know why Amazon describes it as seasoned."
3,"The hot chocolate is good yet not really extra special. The shipping cost is almost the same cost as the product. I will continue to purchase good quality hot chocolate locally and thereby avoid the excessive shipping expensive."
3,"My husband really likes his coffee strong but Jet Fuel was even too strong for him.  If you want a dark, bold, and strong tasting coffee then go for it otherwise you will find yourself watering it down."
3,"I have had this energy drink on a number of occasions.  It's quite effective as an energy drink, and I do like the taste of it.  The taste doesn't linger in your mouth while you're working out.  However, I do not find this price to be good considering it's listed on Amazon where prices are usually much better on products across the board.  I purchase this drink at Whole Foods for $1.99 each and on sale at $1.69 each."
3,"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty."
3,"You know what the product is. Its the same thing that you get at any regular grocery store. But its cheaper and delivered right at your doorstep, so the idea of purchasing from Amazon is great, especially if you are looking to bring in $25 worth of goods in your shopping cart to become eligible for ""Free supersaver"".<br />The problem I have is that on a few bites, I got a feeling that the cashews were not very fresh. I did not check the expiration date, but I am guessing that the cashews were stocked for a long time before reaching me.<br /><br />I dont think I will be purchasing it from here again."
3,"I decent coffee if you prefer a mild blend with all the convenience of a K-Cup."
3,"On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order."
3,"the chocolate is much better than the regular. i also thought i would be getting four jars because this costs more than buying two not bundled together. because of this i wasted money and am not fully satisfied. product itself is decent"
3,"I was somewhat disappointed with this coffee purchased thru Amazon, as I had got previously the Starbucks VIA ready brew coffee, decaf Colombia Roast which I enjoyed very much."
3,"After drinking this, I was torn on what i thought about it but the kicker was the taste. I've never been a huge fan of fruit Punch and this reminds me of any drink that has that title. It tastes exactly the same as everything else. To make me want to squeeze something into my water and go that extra mile, I want to have something beautiful at the end of the rainbow. Fruit Punch - not exactly a pot of gold.<br /><br />As for claims of being good for you, the label does say its so but my testing kit was at the cleaners so I'm not really sure. I suppose it is like anything else; you can take the bottle at value and hope for the best but, in the end, like the way it tastes as well.<br /><br />One last thing on this is the amount you should pore. When it says to add a squeeze, i'm not exactly sure what that is. I added, sipped, added, sipped some more, trying to get my amount. Personally, I would have liked a spoon comparison or something. I thought this was perhaps odd, and then someone else at my home asked me the same thing on it - and said they liked the Fruit Punch, did I get it from an infomercial.<br /><br />Go figure."
3,"i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards"
3,"This product was tried by my entire family, everyone disliked it.  It had the espresso jolt but tasted metallic and stale.  Nobody wanted to finish the can. I like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS"">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a> better though they can be too cloying sweet.  This Illy was not too sweet it just tasted not fresh. I wouldn't recommend, just use your Keurig and make <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZZQAKM"">Coffee People Donut Shop Regular Iced Coffee, 22-Count</a> and make your own FRESH iced coffee."
3,"These k-cups are certainly bold and strong, but the finish is flat and thin.  It's lacking in overtones after the inital dark wave.  I just started exploring k-cups since my machine arrived last week.  Initially I was surprised how watery the house blends are.  I wanted something dark and rich in texture.  But so far, I'd rather drink Tully's French Roast extra bold k-cups which is just about as strong as Dark Magic but with a wider spectrum and better finish."
3,"I got a variety of flavors, but for the amount of shipping charged, they could have been better packaged. In addition some of the flavors were great, like root beer, others vile, like the chemical-tasting watermelon.<br />In hot humid weather it is also really hard to get them out of the wrapper. You can put them in the fridge for a while, but unless you are working on craft or cookery projects or run a store, don't buy in bulk in warmer months or if you live in warmer climates."
3,"I've had a great many types of vegetarian meat alternatives from all over the world. Though these have soy  protein as well, they still have a bit of that rubbery texture/mouth feel that seitan ""wheat meat"" has. The price is for a very large can with quite a bit of product, so I thought that it was competitively priced with other similar products. I emptied the can and froze it for using what I need at a time, which has worked out well. It thaws perfectly. I don't think I will order again unless I need a shelf stable hydrated product. There are better tasting/textured options, including any of the Quorn chick'n tenders available with frozen foods."
3,"I had bought this pack because it was my first K-Cup coffee maker. I would have given 4 stars for the variety but I am not a flavored coffee drinker and most of the coffees were of that type."
3,"I guess it's just me judging from the other reviews, but I can taste and smell alcohol, even though I know for a fact that there isn't any and unlike the other reviewers, I didn't add any to it.  It tasted like every alcoholic margarita I've had, except without salt.  It wasn't too great, but it wasn't the best thing I've ever had either."
3,"I have purchased this product due to its amazing reviews.  I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating."
3,"I have a diabetic cat and this food is awesome.  I also thought, how nice to have it delivered to my house for close to the same costs as I was paying in a very smelly pet store.  BUT my main complaint not about amazon but that this is coming from another associated company...it did NOT arrive during the estimated time but 5 days later than that.  In all total from order to delivery it took 17 days to receive my order!!!  Had I know that I would have either ordered MUCH earlier or not at all!  The final complaint is that this does not qualify for free shipping even thought the cost is over 25 dollars.  Maybe again because it is an affliated company or due to the weight.  This too made my wait and the costs to wait less appealing."
3,"Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid. I thought it was just ok. A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me. It's pretty much the same as Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call, I can't tell the three apart. Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one."
3,"Panettone is an Italian Christmas tradition. A product that is inherently artisanal and difficult to make, requires use of ""sourdoughs"" from Milan that have been sometimes kept alive for over a century. Understandably, you cannot get a good mass market adaptation of a real Panettone. If you want to try, you should still go for something made in Italy like Bauli, Perugina, Balocco, Motta etc. or for the quintessential higher-priced commercial panettone: Tre Marie.<br /><br />The above-notwithstanding, Bauducco is a decent product if you see it for what it is: a commercial cake from a Brazilian producer; an item that essentially exploits the Italian sounding name of the original panettone. The bottom line: if you can find this product on sale for $5 or so buy four of them. They will probably be good until new year. However, there is no way I would spend more than $8 for this.<br /><br />I found it on sale at a local store and my daughter loved it for breakfast with some milk. But that is about it."
3,"Like other xylitol gum I've tried the flavor was good but the gum was hard and within minutes it was grainy and unpleasant to chew, unlike Trident gum, which is sweetened, at least partly, with xylitol, is good chewing gum and that's the whole point!"
3,"I have not tried this food myself, but my dog is not impressed. He leaves most of it in his dish and begs for snacks. It seems to agree with him fine, but I will not buy it again because he does not want to eat it."
3,"Interesting, my case only has 88 dressing packets in it.  Just got it today.  I wouldn't have counted them, but the box with the dressing in it was open (tape broken on one side) and it looked suspicious based on the previous review.  Someone at the packing plant must like this product!?"
3,"I bought these on another online site and the Amazon ones are almost $3 cheaper. I love these. In fact, I've grown quite addicted. Unfortunatley, they have tons of sodium and also contain MSG, which is causing me to gain a lb or two of water weight and stalls my weight loss progress very effectively. If I were only trying to maintain, these wouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />I won't buy them again, for these reasons."
3,"This is a great toy that my dog loved, but it didn't last very long. She likes to whip her toys around, and knocked this on something, and the container cracked. Also, the new style of toy has a nylon ""flossy"" style rope that is difficult to clean--man, that thing got smelly fast from kibble & doggy drool!<br /><br />Overall, great concept, but I wouldn't recommend if your dog is rough with their toys..."
3,"I am not a fan of the fruit-flavored sparkling waters sold by so many soda and water bottlers. If you are going to carbonate a beverage, why not really carbonate it instead of the halfway carbonation of sparkling water? Izze has the light ""fizz"" of those sparkling waters, but the flavor is much better because it is 70% juice.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the taste. I keep a supply in the refrigerator and, although I do not drink it every day, I find that it is a nice change from water or soda. The 8.4 oz. cans are just right, and they chill quickly. As others have pointed out, the flavor is much better cold than at room temperature.<br /><br />So would I buy it again? Maybe. My husband and I both thought it was ""OK."" We liked drinking it, but would not go out of our way to buy more. And we do not feel any sense of urgency to try other flavors.<br /><br />If you are looking for a somewhat healthier soda replacement, Izze may be a good choice. For juice, I will stick to plain, old-fashioned juice."
3,"If you're a Grapenuts fan, don't get the Grapenuts flakes.  IT's just not the same.  They get soggy fast and they don't have the crunch.  It's just not worth it. If you're just looking for a nutritional cereal though, it's okay, though not as tasty as some others out there."
3,"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome."
3,"I'm sure if people like sun-dried fruits they would really like this but i guess i was expecting something else so its kind of hard to give this a fair review....<br /><br />Its very flavorful, it tastes and feels very ""fresh"", it has an interesting texture and you can easily ""fool"" your eyes and stomach with this ""healthy"" treat!!"
3,"The shipping was great , no problem there.  I just do not like the flavor of this coffee so much.  Wish I could find a decaf that tasted as good as regular."
3,"I TRIED THIS TEA.<br /> IT'S A BITTER BLEND. STRONG.  HAS A SHARP OVERTONE. ICED TEA IS BITTER TOO. I THINK IT GIVES ME A DULL HEAD ACHE. NOT AS GOOD AS TWINNINGS ENGLISH BREAKFAST TEA.<br /><br />PROBABLY WON'T BUY AGAIN.<br /><br />YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY.<br /><br />P.S. AS FOR THE ALL CAPS I USE THEM BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE VERY WELL. HOWEVER ALL THE WORDS WILL BE SPELLED CORRECTLY. ALL MY REVIEWS ARE CONCISE. I PROMISE TO REFRAIN FROM OPINION."
3,"This was a good value for what I paid. It fit my kurig fine however it was stronger than I like and left grounds in the cups. I am assuming that is because it has a net instead of a cup."
3,"You're not going to fool anyone into thinking this is a real true mojito, but to be honest, it's a pretty good low-cal substitution. To be honest, I feel a little strange sipping on Mojito-flavored Crystal Light when it's mixed with water (and I'm not a huge fan of the slight artificial taste).<br /><br />But when you add rum instead, it's the perfect drink for sitting out on the deck during the hot summer months (fine, or cuddled up on a couch in the winter, with the heat on high!). Especially when you add some fresh mint and a slice of lime in.<br /><br />I am kind of tempted to sip this at work to see if it helps transport me to a different place :)"
3,"The tea is ok.  It isn't very strong; I want to love Stash teas yet they are very weak in flavor.  One has to use extra tea bags to make the taste come out right.  Why oh why can't they get the flavor right?<br /><br />I want to love this tea yet I cannot because the amount of tea in each bag is so weak!"
3,"I love these chips and order them by the case. But it is a gamble since they often don't taste as good as they can. They taste different from bag to bag but I keep ordering !"
3,"We did a taste test with Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn and 1 out 3 liked the popcorn. We found it had an after taste and was a weird texture. I found that fudge was nice taste but I passed after two peices.  One who loved them was my 13 year old son who finished the box this week. I would pass - make some popcorn and enjoy!"
3,"I thought this product would be amazing, based on the way it smelled when I opened the bag, but it was just average. Not great, but not awful."
3,"I purchased two packs of the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil and one of the two packs was not properly packed.  The product has leaked and the inside of the box and its contents were wet from the product.  The other pack was ok."
3,"Strong coffee with average coffee taste.  In the Starbucks category as I see it."
3,"I bought these gumballs for my sister as a gag gift. we love sushi and wasabi but these did not taste like wasabi! They were gross! But it was still really funny to buy her wasabi gumballs. Wouldnt have changed it but would have been nice if they actually tasted like wasabi. Shipped on time and in perfect condition."
3,"I've tried GoPicnic brand snacks before, and found them fairly decent for a healthier option.  This one was not as good as others we've had.  My 4 year old son and I sat down to try this, and we both LOVE salmon.  We eat it canned, baked, in dips, smoked, etc.  Living in Alaska, we eat a lot of salmon.  We both took a couple of bites of this dip, and didn't finish.  It's okay in a pinch, but a little too hot (spicy) with an odd flavor that covers up the salmon.  It's also a very strange almost gel-like consistency that we didn't like, most likely from the corn starch.<br /><br />The crackers were good, although they are white flour instead of whole grain, and we very rarely eat white flour, even though they were organic.<br /><br />We don't eat a lot of soy due to the health issues, especially GMO soy which this probably is, but we did taste the edamame for this review.  They were dry without much flavor.<br /><br />The Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix was a little odd.  It tasted okay, but was an odd combination of dried banana chips, ginger peanuts, and dried cranberries.  Not our favorite fruit & nut combo.<br /><br />The chocolate was decent, although not as good as Endangered Species dark chocolate.  It was organic, which is a plus.<br /><br />The container & packaging was nice and included a fork and napkin, so you can take it with you on the run.  There's even a Sudoku puzzle on the inside of the box for some post-picnic fun :-)<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I'd rather eat this than fast food or Snackables, but this wasn't my favorite flavor combination.  Also if you are looking for organic snacks, the only organic items in this box are the crackers and the chocolate.  Also, if you are allergic to corn, there's corn starch & maltodextrin in the salmon spread.  Obviously this also contains soy, fish, wheat, and peanuts for allergy information."
3,"I have longish hair which goes wild with summer humidity and which gets sort of dry from pool chlorine, so I was interested to see what 'Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner' could do for me.<br /><br />I have to say that it's a rough equivalent of Pantene conditioner in thickness and how it goes on and rinses out.  Even afterwards I can't say that I could tell the difference in how my hair looked and felt as compared to Pantene.  And I'd probably buy one or the other interchangeably based on price.<br /><br />I would like to note though that if you have long crazy hair like mine that you might want to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8T8"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Conditioner</a> instead.  It really calmed the humidity frizzies for me and with my next shampoo that's what I'm planning on using for the duration of Summer.<br /><br />Pam T~"
3,"Okay, these are good, but when it comes to being sour, these..... well, they're just NOT. I love them though."
3,"The first box I got of these were great with very fresh tasting nuts; however, the second box was not so fresh and some of the bars had a stale taste.  Nothing worse than a stale nut--can't get that taste out of your mouth.  I guess I'll give it one more try before I cancel my Subscribe & Save for this product."
3,"It's funny that I click on a link to this item from the homepage and it's ""currently unavailable"" Whatever. Old-school style is better. Go to the drugstore, get a bottle of cinnamon oil (yes, they still make it) and throw some toothpicks into it. Leave it a few weeks (minimum) and voila! I have a bottle with toothpicks that have been there 10 years! Talk about saturated!<br /><br />I haven't tried this product, but I think the idea of going back to your Jr. High School days is better done the old style. And I don't see cinnamon paper anywhere... ;)"
3,"My dogs skin has improved a lot since I switched her to this food. I'm dissappointed in the amount of grains used in it and tomato pomace. Protien amounts are great. For only a few dollars more I can get a grain free salmon dog food made in the usa not by one of these huge dog food companies that tend to have recalls all the time. If your on a strict budget this is a great food for dogs, but I want better for mine so I'm switching to Taste of the Wild dog food."
3,"These roasted edamames serve as a great alternative to junk food when your on a trip - especially a car trip. At first they take some getting used to (especially when you're craving greasy, salty chips!). But give a try for one day - and your health halo will be shimmering. One big incentive is that as they contain protein, they will satisfy your hunger instead of fueling it like junk food does."
3,"It's not bad, as the fragrance just hits you when the bag opens. That being said, way too many stems in the product. I'm not a tea expert, but I've bought enough and I think they have more stems than the average. I do like the eco-friendly no frill packaging with the zipper though."
3,"These crepes are handy if you don't have the time, inclination or know how to make them yourself.  They come in handy and the seller is dandy, but the crepes don't taste great or even that ""good.""  Use in a pinch only!"
3,"These cups are a great choice if you would like something different than regular coffee.  It tastes and looks like General Foods International Coffees, rather than real coffee.  There is no coffee remaining in the pods when it is finished. It is a nice treat."
3,"I tried this egg powder by itself and it was pretty bad but I then added it as filler during baking and it was fine. I used a bit in am omelet along with real eggs and you could hardly tell. I had to do a little testing to get the right mix."
3,"This is the first time I tried Columbian coffee from GreenMountain. It is a good tasting medium bodied coffee and I would buy it again. 4 stars for taste.<br /><br />I subtracted one star for K-cup packaging. I have come across 3 K-cups so far that have either closed the water flow completely or allowed a very slow drip. My Kuerig has worked fine before and after those bad K-cups so I know it isn't my machine."
3,"I really love most products from this line but I'm not wild about this one. Even adding less water and letting the soup steep for a longer period of time still leaves me with a fairly watery soup. I always end up spicing it further as well since the flavor is so mild. This one's just not for me."
3,"I wanted something similar to the vanilla powder that they have in coffee shops for my morning coffee.<br /><br />This powder does taste and smell like vanilla, but doesn't seem to have a strong flavor. Maybe the coffee shop powder uses artificial flavoring to make it more intense? Or maybe this one is 'watered down' too much with maltodextrin?<br /><br />In any case, it's not bad, but still not quite what I'm looking for."
3,"The franks aren't the best substitute for hotdogs.  I didn't like them much and neither did any of the people in my house.  Before getting these I would highly recommend Smart Dogs, they have a much better texture and cook up a lot better.  The outer layer is a little tougher than regular hot dogs.  The best are Tofurkey sausages though.  They are much larger than hot dogs, but have a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Don"
3,"Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count ""value"" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety."
3,"One of my toddlers ate some Raisin Bran at his grandmother's house and loved it, so I've been searching for a healthier alternative. Unfortunately, this wasn't the one for us. It's pretty bland and the texture isn't the best."
3,"You know how when you drink gatorade, you've never really quenched your thirst?  Do you know what I mean?  When I drink gatorade, or anything else with electrolytes in it, my tongue always feels kinda dry afterwards.  Like I should have just had plain water instead.<br />This stuff tastes fine.  I don't think it tasted ""silky smooth"" like the bottle said, but it was fine - tasted like water.  (You want ""silky smooth"" water?  Try Fiji water!  It rocks!).<br />I didn't get anything out of this.  I didn't feel any different or notice any tangible difference.<br />I mean, if you're big into getting electrolytes but don't want to drink gatorade or any of those other goofy products, then this is for you.  Me, I'm sticking with Poland Springs, or Fiji when I can get it!"
3,"I ordered these after I bought the Stonewall Kitchen gluten free chocolate chip cookie mix.  I was so happy to find something like this for my 7 year old!  Unfortunately, the cupcakes were really - icky.  They tasted like corn muffins.  My son is gluten free due to sensitivity, not a disease.  Therefore he does not have to be 100% gluten free.  This makes our choices a bit wider when I am looking at ingredients for him.  The chocolate chip cookies were very good and I'd buy the mix again and make them.  I bought both the chocolate and vanilla cupcake mix.  We found them heavy, and didn't really like the taste.  They were totally disappointing.  I can now go to Hannafords and buy pre made gluten free cupcakes that are actually yummy - they are also a bit heavy.  They don't taste like corn bread and that is the plus.  My suggestion if you order these is make them mini cupcakes and make or buy your own frosting.  For someone who is gluten free, they do taste better than lots of things you can buy and make.  For kids who aren't - they will notice a big difference and most likely not like or want them."
3,"This is one spice that I never pursued in big way until now. The one thing to note is that the sale is slightly damp. I bought on the internet and it works great, but have heard about other grinders not working so well due to the moisture. All in all, I highly recommend this. My first venture into a higher grade salt, and I'm happy. I bought this and a salt grinder and there is a significant difference in the flavor of the salt and foods that you mix it with.  I think the price is a little too high but that is my only real issue other than the moisture."
3,"Delicious but be careful - we found a small stone in it for the third time..<br />very tasty besides the stones that almost made us break our teeth"
3,"These dried peaches were not too bad, but when compared to dried apricots, which I love, I would have to say they were a little over-dried. I had to chew them for a long time before I could swallow them.  I actually bought them to use is a recipe for peaches and cream cookies I saw on the food channel."
3,"I've now tried multiple Walden Farms dips, dressings, and syrups. Some are better than others: for example, the Chocolate dip and Honey Dijon dressing are quite good but I wouldn't buy the Orange Marmalade again. I'm glad that I didn't read these reviews, however, before I bought the Peanut Spread. It is really OK when you mix it with sugar-free jellies and jams. If you can't give up real peanut butter, then don't buy this product. But if you have 90-100 lbs or more to lose like me, and you love the peanut taste, then this Peanut Spread might work for you. Note that I also use the fine product PB2 in my oatmeal in place of real peanut butter. Following some of the suggestions in these reviews I will try to bump up the peanut taste of the Peanut Spread with some PB2."
3,"I guess I'm used to an Italian coffee being a bit bolder.  I was definitely expecting a darker roast.  My favorite Italian roast is still <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512"">Tully's Coffee Italian, K-cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, although this cup is a good every morning or anytime coffee with that crisp Italian finish.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this , just not if you're looking for something incredibly bold."
3,"I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again."
3,"I got one bar <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JLYHKU"">18 Rabbits Squeaky Cheeky Choco Cherry Bunny Bar, Organic, 1.05oz (2 6-packs, 12 count total)</a> from swaggable.com to try and review. I am not paid for this review. When I took my first bite my first impression was that the Bunny Bar was sweet. I did not like the texture, it was nether crunchy or soft, but kinda hard to chew. I could taste a bit of cherry, but not a hole lot which is not good in my opinion. The chocolate didn't seem to be of a very good quality, but it might be because it was semi melted due to the extreme heat we have right now in CA."
3,"At first it is not so hot but.... it grows on you.  I added a very tiny amount of honey in warm water to mix, dash of salt too.  like it so much I made up the entire jar like that and kept it ready in refrig .  I put it on apple slices as a pm snack or mid morning break.  Spreads nicely on an apple, unlike real PB.  Love not getting all those calories."
3,"You know how when you drink gatorade, you've never really quenched your thirst?  Do you know what I mean?  When I drink gatorade, or anything else with electrolytes in it, my tongue always feels kinda dry afterwards.  Like I should have just had plain water instead.<br />This stuff tastes fine.  I don't think it tasted ""silky smooth"" like the bottle said, but it was fine - tasted like water.  (You want ""silky smooth"" water?  Try Fiji water!  It rocks!).<br />I didn't get anything out of this.  I didn't feel any different or notice any tangible difference.<br />I mean, if you're big into getting electrolytes but don't want to drink gatorade or any of those other goofy products, then this is for you.  Me, I'm sticking with Poland Springs, or Fiji when I can get it!"
3,"We ordered several times and each time some of the cans come dented.  This time it was 8 of the 36."
3,"I have found the quality control of my recent purchases of K-Cups to be marginal, at best.  I look for cups whose foil covers bulge at the top.  Unfortunately, many of the cups seem to have their seals breached, and the cover is flat and sometimes concave.  The performance of these cups is often terrible, with grounds escaping both within the coffee maker and into the cup of coffee and coffee even spilling out of the maker beyond the bounds of the rim of the cup.  Worse yet, the taste of the coffee is lifeless and insipid.  In a word, it is stale.  When the packaging seems intact the coffee tastes fine, and there is no mess or clean up necessary.  I'll keep searching for a more reliable provider."
3,"This is a great product and my three cats eat the Tuna Too Cool and the Tuna and Chicken canned food, but they don't like salmon, I guess.  You would just have to try it to know for sure.  This is a very healthy product because it contains NO GRAINS and is produced by human standards.  I know BFF is an excellent product."
3,"You know when you are making a burrito and you want something saucy...not just<br />salsa?  This arrived in time to make it to my burrito night tonight, it was ok,<br />not bad...not as flavorful as I had hoped it would be...I ended up putting salsa<br />on it ALSO...so that should tell you.  People who like a LITTLE zing might enjoy<br />this but if you like spicy or a bit of heat...I would suggest you try something else."
3,"Are there healthier choices for a snack bar? Yes. Are there better tasting choices for a snack bar? Yes. Is there a snack bar with more of a peanut taste? Eh, maybe. I wanted to suggest these for when you go hiking. However, with 220 calories, and 110 of those being fat calories, I'm not so sure I would suggest these for hiking. Factor in the 160mg of sodium, it seems counter productive. Health wise, I would suggest countless other bars. Taste wise, I don't see these bars replacing Blueberry Trio Bars in our snack drawer. As for peanuty taste, it's a toss up between these and a Payday bar. I would give the edge to the Planters Big Nut Bars just on the healthier factor.<br /><br />All in all, if you love peanuts, not worried about indulging, and don't mind a heavy feeling snack. Then by all means, this is a good choice for you."
3,"I have nothing against the product as I know other people whose dogs eat them but for whatever reason my dog would not touch them. She can be picky at times but the treats that she likes she never turns down. I bought two bags in different flavors and wound up giving them to my sister for her dogs."
3,"Purchased prod w/standard seed kit and regular basil was 2nd to sprout, but after 2 weeks it had a clear fungus...fury mold to all of it.  Out of remaining seeds in kit (my kit had cilantro which was replaced w/thyme)...thyme so far is producing the least.  Thyme was actually the 1st to sprout but is faltering in the long haul. The most aggresive growth is the mint.  Next it is neck & neck w/dill & chive.  I find myself cutting dill & chives to ""clear the shade"" in the hopes that the rest can catch up. I will say that I left a hydroponic tomatoe in the light of the machine...and in 2 weeks the fruit still looked fresh & the skin had visual bubbles or pimples in it.  When I opened the tomatoe nearly every seed had sprouted...yes SPROUTED within the tomatoe (so cool to see by the way - actual leaves inside a tomatoe!).  So I transplanted 4 seedlings into the empty basil ""herb pod"" and moved it to the back corner of the unit.  AeroGarden says the nutrients are different for herbs vs. vegetables...but if I can keep these sprots alive for another 4 weeks...I am in business with 4 REAL tomatoe plants.  No matter any results, it has been a blast watching the growth, especially the tomatoes which bursted as a seed inside a tomatoe that I had to cut out and now is an entitiy with leaves (and will soon need to be separated). And in the end I have a LOT of mint frozen for our summer Mojitos!!"
3,"I love the Chocolate Mint and Peanut butter flavors, but this flavor tasted like vanilla whey.  It was not bad tasting, but I drink enough whey and have experimented with various whey ice cream recipes and this reminded mea bit of some of the concoctions I have made and for the price, it just wasn't that special of a treat.  I won't buy this flavor again, but I do enjoy choc. mint and choc peanut butter a lot (which is unusually because I normally don't like chocolate ice cream)."
3,"The ginger taste in this is overpowering. I made it with one cup of water and thought it was undrinkable. I doubled the amount of hot water and still couldn't stomach it. I tripled the amount of water and thought it was still awful.<br /><br />But, my wife thought it was okay and my daughter, who is just back from college, loved it. My daughter loved it full strength, half strength and a third strength and said she's actually going to buy it.<br /><br />So, I'm torn here in rating this. Had I not consulted my family, I'd blast this with one star. My wife was almost neutral, but my daughter thinks this is the cat's meow. So in all fairness, though I don't like it, three stars."
3,"I usually give my cats canned food as a treat, so I thought I would give this a try for them.<br /><br />Like the other reviews the ingredients list was nice, there were a few ingredients I wasn't sure about like carrageenan and menadione sodium bisulfite but they all turned out to be a mineral supplement or a thickening agent.<br /><br />I opened the chicken pot pie first. Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it."
3,"Yes there 35 cups of different flavors. I had to count them to make sure they were all there. No it was not in a limited edition box but a plain white box where all the cups were just thrown in. Yes you are buying coffee but don't expect it to be in a printed gift box."
3,"I only purchased the seeds because on Dr. Oz's show he recommended caraway seeds for people with digestive issues....he was very wrong. I was eating a handful of whole caraway seeds daily, behind every meal, for almost a month and the stomach issues that I were having prior to the seeds, still exists. I did discover that these seeds are great for bad breath. After I brush my teeth daily, periodically I would feel like I have unfresh breath during late afternoons prior to the caraway seeds, but after eating them for almost a month, my breath is odorless throughout the day. Hope this review helps."
3,"Dingo products are great, my dogs love them, but these are not for small dogs, too large and cumbersome for my two Shih Tzus.."
3,"Starbucks coffee is intense, flavorful and rewarding.  So adding vanilla flavor to it seems redundant..and it is.  This is a very powerful flavored coffee.  If you are into flavord coffees, then you will love this. If you're a purist...skip it."
3,"If you just want to smell your coffee this is the product for you.  It smells amazing and so chocolatey, but the taste is off.  It isn't chocolate tasting at all maybe a little sweet or artificial.  I much prefer the mudslide for chocolate coffee."
3,"My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever."
3,"Each of these Switch juice drinks seems to be about 50 percent sweeter than it needs to be. Imagine mixing Perrier, Kool-Aid and Mountain Dew together and you've got a good idea what to expect. OK, I know it's not that bad. But would somebody please tell my taste buds?"
3,"This tea has a very good taste, however the cost seems very high for the small amount in the container. I purchased this after a Mexico vacation where I had Twining's 'Voage' Indian Chia from teabags. I could not find thr Twining's product so I tried this, hoping it would be even more flavorful. It is about equal to the Twining's, in my opinion, and the cost was significantly more. I don't feel this product is worth the money, however you may disagree especially if you have never had the Twining's 'Voyage' product as it does not seem to be available in the US."
3,"This is over priced but I don't know where the previous reviewer finds five pound bags of flour for $1 or .69 cents. That was years ago. Today we're in the $4 to $5 range and upwards. This flour would not be worth the order at Amazon unless you live somewhere far away and can't get it otherwise."
3,"My first taste and I was disappointed.  I and a daughter have gone through 4 boxes at this point and this is what I've found:<br /><br />Taste is like those huge pillows of shredded wheat cereal pounded down into a hard, thick crackery crispbread.  Not even close to the amount of seeds in the picture and maybe 1 or 2 currants per crispbread.  The added brown sugar gives it the allusion of being sweetened with currants when they are so ""absent"" that the sweetness is definitely the sugar.  I've found 1, possibly 2 currants per cracker.  Needed at least a tiny bit of sodium as is lacking in taste.  It's much more blackened..much...than the picture which I suppose hides the fact it has very few seeds.<br /><br />It tastes best microwaved for about 15 to 20 seconds then covered with a thin layer of cream cheese.  Doing this makes it a tasty treat.  But then covering anything in cream cheese makes it a tasty treat.  Not enough nutritional value and taste for me to purchase something so odd like this again, unfortunately."
3,"This product was to big for my dogs and will not purchase again just due to size the product is fabulous and my dogs love the medium size."
3,"This KIND bar is pretty intense.  The chocolate and cherry combo create a really strong flavor. The palm kernal oil ingredient in the chocolate is a concern as that oil is not said to be very healthy."
3,"My 2-year old dog was born with a malformed ball & socket in her hip.  As a result, she has a hard time standing up after running and playing.  Eventually this will become hip displacia.  Our vet recommended we start her on a glucosamine supplement.  I tried giving her this supplement but she's not too crazy about it.  I mix it in her food but I can tell she doesn't really like it.  I don't care for the STRONG cinnamon smell so maybe that is off-putting to her.  I will continue to give it to her in the hopes that it will help her but I really wish the smell was different."
3,"It takes really great but so pity i can't say the same about the look. I was surprised when i discovered that the minute it started boiling it was already broken and becoming saggy. maybe it's not roasted enough?"
3,"I ordered this product because it was provided complimentary in a hotel that I stayed at. The green tea and genmaicha is the one that I like best but it would be even better if the toasted flavor was stronger. For the price, there are better teas available."
3,"It's kind of noisy so my dog doesn't love it. It's kind of an awkward design. There are better treat toys out there - my dog loves the disc shaped one."
3,"As stated on the packaging, this vanilla flavored coffee by Starbucks has a ""subtle flavor and an indulgent aroma"".  So much so, in fact, that brewing the coffee is a more satisfying experience than drinking it.<br /><br />Going off of the recommended 2 Tbsp of coffee for every 6 oz. of water, I found the brew diluted and weak-willed.  Stepping up the dosage does deliver a more powerful vanilla taste, but you'll find yourself plowing through the 11 oz. bag at a much quicker rate.<br /><br />All told, if a light, mild vanilla brew is what you're after, this offering by Starbucks will suit you.  If, however, you're after a more potent brew, you would likely get more bang for your buck with a less ""subtle flavor."""
3,"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore."""
3,"I used to buy tins of this all the time.  I wish they still sold it like that.  This was always my favorite flavor.  After much waiting and always searching the stores I got online to track this down.  I found it here but in large vending machine quantity.  That is the reason it lost one star.  I still have several big bags of this in my closet.  Guess I'm good to go for a while!  I have found to help keep this fresh I use an old plastic Nestle Quik container.  One bag fills it right up.<br /><br />This lost the second star for the product itself.  First I find this much weaker than it used to be in the tins.  I have to add more to each cup to get the right flavor.  Second this is Very chalky and Very Very powdery.  I can taste the powder in it which before I could not.  I even tend to have a powdery residue at the bottom of my cup as well.  This may be because this was for a machine or something so it has a slightly different consistency.  Although about the time this was leaving the shelves of stores I noticed a change in several of the other flavors.  All of which were changing slightly in ways like that.  That was also when they started making some of their lattes foam up.  So I don't know if this changed during that time as well.<br /><br />Simply, this fills the void that was left since I no longer find it on the shelves.  Its not a perfect match to what I fell in love with but it is definitely still tasty. I would order it again to have it and probably will whenever the day comes when I run out again."
3,"This is a nice little popcorn, but besides the fact that the kernels are smaller than other popcorn, I didn't notice any great difference. The batch I popped was definitely not ""virtually hulless"" as they say in the promotion."
3,"It is bubble gum. The flavour is supposed to last for much longer, but to my taste, it lasted no longer than any other gum! End of story.<br /><br />Mrbluenun"
3,"I didn't like this tyvita as well as the seseme one.  It isn't as flavorful and cracks into pieces too easily."
3,"Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery,<br />Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size"
3,"I tried this because someone said how high quality it is,  well my cats moseyed over to it,  ate a little then sashayed over to the kibble and ate a little.  For 1.70 a can,  it just doesnt ring any bells.  Wish I could buy meat babyfood at less than a dollar a jar somewhere.....but I cant say that my cats liked this better than the 50 cans."
3,"I read the ingredients and thought these would be a delicious, healthy snack but they are just plain BLAND!  They are crispy and fresh but there is very little flavor to them.  I was sincerely disappointed.  I'm just glad I bought them on sale or I would be angry as well as saddened by the lack of cheese flavor.  If you are looking for an expensive 'crunch' without tongue tingling taste, these are for you!  I can NOT recommend them.  I will not be buying these again!"
3,"I have had the vanilla, triple chocolate and PB versions of the power crunch bars and those are all very good.  The cookies & cream flavor however tastes very strongly of fake sugar.  For some reason the other flavors do a better job at masking this, the C&C  does not.<br /><br />I recommend having these with a hot drink, if you drink something cold while eating them you get a weird filmy coating to the roof of your mouth.  All flavors work well at keeping hunger away for 3 hours and do not cause gastric distress like some low carb bars can.  I prefer the other flavors over the C&C, but these are fine if the other flavors are gone and I need a quick bite with my morning coffee.<br /><br />I do not crave sweets after I eat a power crunch bar; sometimes sugar substitutes make me want to eat more sugar, but these actually cut my sweet tooth off at the pass."
3,"I used the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner for a week.  The combination leaves me hair very soft, but by the next day it is flat and oily looking.  I like that it is for long hair.  The conditioner is pretty thick, which is much better than the watered down cheap ones.  It smells great, too.  I'm looking for a conditioner that doesn't make my hair oily, but makes it soft and keeps away static at the same time.  This conditioner wasn't the right fit for me, but it may be for you."
3,"I saw the ratings and was curious.  For my tastes, it's not as good as Illy or Community Coffee.  It also seemed to have a funny after taste."
3,"there is a little chemical kick but not to bad, as far a keurig goes this is the way to buy"
3,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:48 Mins<br /><br /></span>This white tea is good quality, but is not worth the money, I purchased once to test out a different brand, I do very much like the containers, though I will only buy this if the other brands are out of stock. Potrero Tea, organic silver needle, is superior in my opinion."
3,"It is a unique possession and the most beautiful mini tree i have ever had the pleasure of owning. I must assure its survival,as i absolutely adore biological beauty and the mysteries which beckon. Another reason i had purchased this Japanese cultured tree is to be able to help the country whose devastating tsunami destroyed much of their botanical life as such this past year,2011. I hope my purchase did indeed help the Oriental country.I wish to thank the people whom have given us,a diverse people in the U.S,the pleasure of sharing their distinct beauty with us."
3,"I've been buying Pirate's Booty for about 7 years now. It seems to me that the 4 ounce bags taste much better than the 1 ounce. No taste of Cheddar in this shipment of 1 ounce bags. Very disappointed in it. Seems strange that they should taste so different as it is the same product."
3,"Got this for my 9-yr-old Australian shepherd.  I also bought the orange one for the younger dog.  Both dogs were able to remove the treats from the balls in under 10 minutes. (It took me at least 5 minutes to put the treat in.) I'm glad I tried it, but won't get any more.  Neither of my dogs is a very aggressive chewer...just very clever."
3,"This product page doesn't really say how much actual catnip you get. Under production dimensions, the weight is given as 3.4 ounces, while the shipping weight is only 3.2 ounces (makes you wonder what they don't ship you). On the package, the stated net weight is 1.0 ounces. I've purchased this item twice and the last time I weighted the catnip while it was still in the bag. My postal scale reported a disappointing 0.8 ounces. That's probably just a fluke, but it's disappointing none the less."
3,"I love Cheerios brand cereal with banana slices. I was looking for a gluten free cereal to replace the Cheerios. The texture of an O cereal is part of my banana/cereal experience. This cereal is a little too crunchy and sticks to my teeth when chewing. I use almond milk.<br /><br />I found the taste is important too. I should have read the ingredients to see there are no oats in this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028UA2NA"">Nature's Path Organic Whole O's, Gluten Free Cereal, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> like the Cheerios brand. I wonder why there are no oats, as they can be gluten free. That is what I was looking for in an O's cereal. ""O is for Oats"" to me."
3,"The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>  does taste much better than this one in my opinion. This flavor tastes a bit like instant coffee that was just brewed strong."
3,"This is a nice tea.  It is!  It's just not MY cup of tea, as the saying goes.<br /><br />I was surprised at how sweet it is, and had to check the ingredients several times in an effort to figure out where the sweetness comes from.  As other reviewers have commented, it tastes a little like artificial berry flavoring.  There are no artificial berry flavors listed, but that's what the tea tastes like!  ""Natural strawberry flavor"" must be some special kind of potent.<br /><br />I couldn't pick out the rooibos flavor, though I'm sure it's under the stronger berry flavor somewhere."
3,"The cans are teeny tiny, and for what they charge it's just not worth the expense. Also, I really hate how they charge different prices for different flavors. That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. The product itself is yummy, just not happy about the prices."
3,"This coffee has a nice hazelnut flavor, but it is too weak in my opinion.  It's great if you use the 6 oz. cup, but if you use Timothy's Hazelnut you can use the 10 oz. size."
3,"They were good, just like I remember them from childhood but they were way overpriced. Not sure what the bag weighed but the price was out of line for the size of the bag."
3,"Good product, the only down side for us was my wife and I expected it to be 46 oz. liquid measure not by weight. So, instead of getting almost 3 qts. of nectar we got 2 qts."
3,"Have plenty of water handy.  The over-the-top taste of sea salt and cracked pepper nearly overcame all the cashew flavor.  The Emerald almonds were much more enjoyable because they were more subtlely flavored."
3,"Basically these are large fig newtons, cherry flavored. They're also small sized, good for toddlers and calorie-conscious adults, but be aware that they are less than 1/2 the size of an average cereal bar. I bought these thinking ""healthy snack"", but really I'd be better off giving my child some whole grain toast w/ jam and nut butter. These are convenient, though, but very crumbly/messy--not good car seat food IMO."
3,"I have a 20# Boston Terrier (a breed known for knee joint issues) so I thought this would be a good product to try with her. Unfortunately, after using for over a month, I haven't seen any specific and obvious improvements. However, to be honest, she wasn't currently experiencing any issues when I started her on the powder, so I am using it as preventative care. She doesn't seem to mind the taste at all and even though it's going on dry food, she still manages to ingest most of it. I use it probably 4-5 times a week and have been giving her 1 tsp a time and we still have quite a bit of the powder left...so for us it's not that bad of a deal. We will probably buy continue buying it off and on as she gets older and/or has actual knee issues (which come and go with her level of activity)."
3,"Intended to make baby's food, thought I would just use my steamer basket and food processor but got this for Xmas and use it daily. I've steamed and pureed fruit, veg, meat, fish, grain and used it to reheat. I like that you just set it to steam and walk away (you have a baby after all). It's generally easy to use and clean. Complaints about big batches are funny because I can't do SMALL enough batches! I like to make just one or two servings to eat that day. I don't want to serve frozen food all the time or the same food day after day. Babycook does not blend small batches, I have to mash by hand! This is exactly what such a tiny appliance should do!<br /><br />There are also design issues, not how it looks (it is cute) but how it works (it is finicky). The spatula and mixing lid are awkward extra pieces to keep track of and clean. The mixing lid is useless. When removing the lid to stir there are two messy lids to remove, set down on the counter and clean, etc. It works just fine without it. The spatula is not great at scraping the bowl and if it is only intended to lift a hot basket, this could be solved more intelligently. Teardrop lid handles are slippery and difficult to grasp. Blades are not easily removable."
3,"Very easy to heat up and stores for a long time at room temperature.  It's a relatively tasty and easy meal, but if you eat the whole package (as I do), you've already consumed enough salt for the day.  I'll probably avoid it in the future for that reason alone."
3,"This falafel isn't bad, it's got some interesting ingredients like crushed wheat that add to texture and the spices are good, but...I expect that falafel mix has a fairly long shelf life, being a dry good and everything, and the case I got was dated to expire in a few months.  I like falafel and everything, but now I'm going to have to eat it at least once a week in order to use it before it expires.  This is disappointing because I was thinking more along the lines of eating it once a month for the rest of the year.  It also makes me wonder exactly how old my case actually IS, since I would think falafel mix would be good for a few years.  Add that to the fact that it's not really any better than the mix I can buy in bulk at my local supermarket, and that it was considerably more expensive, I was overall not really pleased with this purchase."
3,"I really didn't care much for this flavor or should I say ""lack of"" flavor.  I bought a case of bar-be-que also and they have much more taste."
3,"The peanut flavor is pretty weak in this product, but it's not the worst tasting product. For example it is better than the ""off flavor"" in Pamela's Choc Chip cookies from the flour mixture, not that Pamela's CC is the worst mind you. I did not find the bars to be stiff or hard, but it wasn't Quaker chewey either. I've only just tried them for the first time, so I don't know how the product quality varies over time."
3,"I have rarely been so perplexed when I have written a review of any product, and I have written more than a few reviews. But this nutrition bar confuses me - it's not one of those ""candy bars with vitamins"" like some other bars, nor is it as nutritious as say, an apple and a handful of nuts (my usual ""meal replacement.""). It tastes good, but not as good as a piece of fruit and handful of nuts or the candy bar type bar for that matter, but let's not go there. It tastes a whole lot better than those ""Penance for eating a convenient snack"" types of bars, of course.<br /><br />Many of these nutritional bars are billed for meal replacement and as such, this bar fills you more than most because of its generous size (measures 2-1/2"" x 4-1/4"", larger than a competing bar we had in the pantry.) It is a lot more filling than its weight of 1.8 oz (51 grams) would imply. That's probably due to its generous 6 grams of fiber, which unfortunately is likely due to chicory root extract, am ingredient I personally avoid. I stayed full for hours after eating this, which is unusual for a little bar.<br /><br />The taste also confused me, and your mileage definitely may vary in this area.  I was unable to discern any cocoa flavor at all, but my recent finishing of a box of Valentine's Day chocolate may have something to do with that - the flavor just wasn't strong enough to register with me. I did taste some cherry flavor, which I really thought was artificial flavor instead of real cherries. The first impression I got was more like Robitussin instead of fresh cherries. I didn't taste walnuts at all, and was surprised to see them in the ingredient listing. Walnuts, eggs, wheat and chicory may be allergic triggers for some, and some label reading is in order before buying.<br /><br />Would I buy these? Probably not, because lately I choose an apple (100 cal) and a packet of 100 calorie cocoa coated almonds when I want a meal in a moment. A check of the label reveals that it has 200 calories, which seems about average for a bar like this, but it also contains 7 grams of fat, which puts this bar into the ""once in a while treat"" section in our home. Sadly, my husband and child rejected this bar out of hand. That makes it a difficult choice because although these would rate higher than many competing bars, they don't rate as high as peanut butter crackers (190 cal, and very little nutrition), a favorite because of taste alone."
3,"Shipping and service was great as usual. They changed the formula on this so the taste is not as good as it used to be."
3,"Was a bit unhappy with the shipment..6 of them were butter toffee. I felt like that was a kind that they were trying to get rid of.  I read the reviews and decided to take a chance...what I got was just ok.  Would not reorder."
3,"I would have liked to give these 2 and a half stars, because they're basically middle-of-the-road. They taste more or less like a Fig Newton, and you won't miss the fat at all. They are not as soft as Fig Newtons.<br /><br />These cookies are great if you're on a diet because two of them are only 100 calories, however they are on the small side so you may end up eating more.<br /><br />I would say that overall, the taste is comparable to a Fig Newton, but slightly more firm in texture and a smaller size. With all things considered, if a box of Fig Newtons and Fig Newmans were sitting on the shelf together, I would probably just go by price and get the cheaper item and not think about the brand."
3,"The coffee was okay, but it didn't have as much of a coconut flavor as I was hoping for. It was also just a little bit more bitter than I like. I finished my bag, but I'm going to stick with my usual brand of coffee from now on."
3,"We've been purchasing direct from retail stores, either PetSmart or Felix & Oscar's in Springfield, VA.  The condition of the cans shipped was not as good as I would have hoped.  Several cans were dented in each shipment.  Quality of the cat food is very good; cost savings may outweigh the shipping issues and the convenience of not going to the pet store."
3,"Costco sells a 2 lb 4 oz can $27.59.  You only have to buy one can at a time.  That much formula would cost $32.16 per 40 oz with this offer."
3,"I had a coupon to get this $3 per 64 ounce juice for $2, so did not feel too badly spending the money, but I have to agree with others, that you would be better off adding your own water and saving money.<br />The ""juice"" is designed to be less sugar without adding artificial sweeteners. If you have a problem with fructose or do not like your kids drinking fruit sugars, then you may find this a good alternative to regular juice, but don't expect much of a grape taste.<br />The grape has more of a concentrated grape powder taste, with water and apple juice being the overall flavors coming through, It has a slight sweetness and the added calcium and Vitamin D is a plus as well as the fact that they use vegetable juice instead of artificial red and blue dyes to make it actually look grape colored, which gives you some idea of how much grape juice it actually has in it.<br />If I had a child, I think I would go for the juice boxes in this category, as they would be super convenient and already watered down, but with the big bottle, it would be so much cheaper to add the water yourself and then you would only be paying around $1.60 a bottle.<br />I can see where it fills a niche for some folks and the taste is not bad. It is refreshing in place of plain water, but does not have the satisfying sweet rich taste of juice. It is really more like juice flavored water.<br />If you have ever added ice to your juice and left it sitting out, this is similar to the flavor of Motts for Tots. It's a bit too much water added."
3,"I have persistent dry scalp so I'm always looking for products to help with this.  I use a tar based shampoo part of the time but don't want to use it daily.  The Clear Scalp and Hair shampoo works fine - my hair is clean, soft and my scalp is not itchy after using it.  But it has a perfume-y scent that I don't care for.  I will not be buying it again because of that.  Perhaps a scent-free shampoo could be developed?"
3,"My older cat who has always eaten dry food suddenly stopped eating.  I've been trying different brands and styles (slices, chunks, pates) and this seems to be the easiest for her to eat. But the smell in the litter box is enough to drive me out of the house! While this is helping to keep her weight on I have to keep searching for something with more greens and grains, apparently those things can help keep the odor down."
3,"My hubby and I tried these tonight after dinner.  I gave them 2 stars and he gave them 4 stars.  So, I averaged a 3 for these.  It tastes more like a sweet cracker than a cookie.  Hubby said the berries were a little too chewy. I didn't think that was a problem. It's not something I plan to go out and buy.  Hubby will probably finish this bag of them. I might like them better if they were in strawberry, apricot or cherry.  There just wasn't enough good flavor to make me want more than one."
3,"I love this mix, I'm actually drinking it now as I write this review!  But don't worry, I'm not too drunk yet...  I can still form sentences.<br /><br />I just realized I'm consuming 75% of my DAILY sodium, just on one 10-ounce drink of this stuff!  Wow, I am going to be bloated tomorrow.  How the heck can 1 serving size be only 3 ounces?  Who drinks a 3-ounce bloody mary, or only one?  That is a really unhealthy amount of salt.  So I would add sodium-free tomato juice to this, and not drink it straight with vodka.<br /><br />The mix fairly spicy-- I would consider it medium, so for some this may just burn your mouth, it does mine, but I like it. And could use more of a tomato taste.  Has MSG in it, which isn't a problem for me(activates flavor receptors in the tongue), but can cause headaches in some people.  It also has sodium benzoate, a preservative.  But in moderation, it tastes great."
3,"This has a really good texture; whether you like it or not will depend on how sensitive you are to how things taste--this tastes like corn.  If you're cooking something like beef stroganoff, it's a plus that this tastes like corn. However, with tomato sauce, it's not a good combination.<br /><br />The other thing about this, is if you're eating it because you have celiac, you should be aware that there may be cross-contamination issues.  Deboles' pasta is made in a factory that also processes wheat pastas.  (And there are those with celiac who are convinced this pasta makes them sick.)  So, if avoiding gluten is really important, get Tinkyada rice pasta instead.<br /><br />Edit:  I did a challenge on this, meaning I ate only this pasta for a day.  It's not gluten free.  Note that this is a subsidiary of Hain Food Group, which, when the new FDA standard on gluten free labeling came in--20ppm or less--stopped labeling its foods with small amounts of barley and slapped on a gluten-free label--and then just waited for celiacs to get sick and get mad at them.  FDA, are you listening?"
3,"We like any kind of artichoke in my family, but the bottoms are so easy to include in anything.  Salad, Spaghetti Sauce, roasted veg, etc.  I use them as a bulking agent with class."
3,"The popcorn is very small and if it does not pop completely it is very hard to eat.  I would not order it again."
3,"[...] bucks for 120 tea bags. not bad. One thing about sweet dreams (for me at least) is that the tea doesnt really do much, except taste good. I dont really get mellow, tired, at all after drinking this tea. Real chamomile tea taste bad and literally smells, so Im glad that this version with mint drowns out the taste. Thats all I can really say about this tea, it tastes good but does not help or provide a better night sleep. Probably because I have insomnia, but I think the whole sweet dreams is a placebo, people see it like me and think ""oh this will put me to sleep"" when in reality you are just putting yourself to sleep by thinking the product will knock you out. Just my opinion though, if it works for you then good for you."
3,"I selected this for my husband to try. He said there was barely any lather compared to other body washes that he's used. Lather doesn't necessarily make you any cleaner, but the lack of suds was a negative.<br /><br />The big positive was the scent. My husband doesn't like smelling like a piece of fruit, but I am very sensitive to strong scents (ex: perfume, cologne). Body wash scents like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MASTQU"">Axe Revitalizing Shower Gel</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GR7KBO"">Old Spice High Endurance Body Wash</a> trigger an allergic reaction in me. I'm happy to say that this men's body wash from Dove isn't too strong to be around, but my husband wasn't impressed with it -- he thought it didn't really have a distinguishing scent.<br /><br />Overall, it will get your man clean, but Dove hasn't really won us over with this one."
3,"This coffee is ok.  I was expecting the chocolate aspect of the coffee to be more explicit.  It didn't wow me"
3,"The product is great, I used to get it at Wal-Mart...but they quit selling it.  Shipping and handling is twice as much as the product - that kind of annoys me, but I ordered anyway."
3,"This cereal is amazing.  Tasty, filling, nutritionally balanced, and cheaper than a lot of other premium ""healthy"" cereals.  I love eating this cereal in the morning for breakfast or after work as a snack.  Really, as far as taste and nutrition, this cereal cannot be beat.<br /><br />However,<br /><br />There is some ingredient in this cereal that causes HORRENDOUS gas in some people.  I am one of them.  Forget beans, peppers, whole grain...all the things that usually cause gas.  This is the worst gas imaginable.  In fact, I am still in awe of how much gas one bowl of this cereal causes.  It is not just the fiber.  I eat a high fiber diet anyway and have never had problems like this...there is some specific ingredient that causes this problem.<br /><br />I would recommend trying this cereal from a store before buying a bunch to see how you react to it."
3,"Unfortunatly my cat would not eat it, and he is not that picky. I gave almost all the cans to a friends of mine who has 3 cats, she said they would not eat it either. Bad batch? I do not know.... Would not buy it again...."
3,"Certainly not the most appetizing snack on the planet. But a lot of that is just how dry it is; make sure you have a beverage handy with this! I recommend hot tea of one kind or another. That might not be super convenient if you just want to carry these to school or on a hike in your backpack for when you need a quick, healthy boost. But it definitely makes them more palatable--trust me! In fact a nice hot tea makes them downright tasty if you're in the mood for such a thing; one of my favorite aspects is that they aren't too sweet."
3,"Nice mix of beans, but NOT soup.  It does say that in the fine print, but why it's called soup mix I don't know.  It is simply a bag of 13 kinds of dry beans which must be washed, soaked, and cooked for hours just like any other dry beans.  It apparently has no added seasonings or such to make it a true soup.  Maybe having thirteen types of dry beans in one bag is a convenience, however it states they are best kept refrigerated or frozen!!!  This is a real disappointment.  I will not reorder this 13 Bean (so-called) Soup Mix."
3,"I bought the GN popcorn popper and the GN portion packs.  The popcorn looks, smells and tastes great!!!  But, there was way too much unpopped corn.  We had an event at the studio and I went through all 24 of the 8oz. packages I bought.  The unpopped kernels equaled over 8 cups!!"
3,"You will like this drink if you're into sweet tasting drinks. The bulk of the juice is apple and grape but it does have a strawberry taste with LIGHT carbonation and it is all-natural. It's an all-natural strawberry flavored Fanta!"
3,"The cereal seemed to be overly sweet and more ""kiddie"" like than expected.  It is a healthier alternative to mainstream cereals for those who prefer a sweeter cereal, maybe a good middle ground.  The cereal was well received and eaten quickly by hubby and the kids (we normally eat organic or Kashi cereals).  I found it to be overly sweet and not very filling.  The bag was only 1/2 full so a little disappointed there as well.  Alternatively, Nature's path makes several organic cereals (without the corn puffs) they sell in a bag at Walmart (sadly not at Target or other stores, I prefer to shop at) that taste good and seem to be a much better bang for your buck.  They still are not as good for you as many other cereals but I feel that they are much better than eating typical kids cereals and good to mix with a healthier one or even for a kids snack."
3,"This coffee was just ok.  It was very mild for a French Roast.  I probably will not purchase again."
3,"at $12 for 2.1 ounces, no wonder one can't pull up the bag to see details.<br />Like $80 per pound!"
3,"To me this seems to be little more than just water. Could it deliver special benefits that I am unaware of? That are tasteless, odorless and colorless? It certainly could. And the makers of the water claim that it does. But there is no way for me to tell. So I cannot recommend this product."
3,"There is decent value in the product and the packaging is first rate. However, the jerky is almost rock hard making it difficult to chew."
3,"I bought two of these at a pet store. One for 100lb plus dogs. My lab is 45 lbs. She consumed it in minutes.<br />I also got a small one for my older chihuahua mix, she consumed it within minutes.<br />Long lasting they are not !<br /><br />Bull sticks are the only item I have found that last a while. However they smell bad. Even the so called orderless ones."
3,"If someone tells you they drink this because they like the taste, they may not be telling the truth. I shared these with quite a few people, and the taste was never one of the good things people said about it. That doesn't mean that there aren't any good things about it, though.<br /><br />It contains some vitamins and minerals. A test at a university found that volunteers saw some improvements in body composition. It claims to burn 100 calories per can, and who can say it doesn't?<br /><br />It assures us that it works best (in its claims to increase muscle and lessen fat) with diet and exercise, and I'm sure that's true. None of the guinea pigs in my house noticed any effects, positive or negative, though we drank it before exercise as instructed.<br /><br />Here's what it does for sure: it gives you a kick of caffeine. If you prefer a sweet, cold drink to coffee or tea, then this is probably better for you than colas. If you start or end your day with a doughnut and coffee to get the caffeine/sweets combo, then this could be a more wholesome choice. And if you believe in it enough, it could encourage you to work out harder or longer, because faith can do wonders, and there are benefits to increasing exercise."
3,"I had bought a  #2 ceramic filter holder and found<br />these papers are a bit too small for the holder.<br />Wish I had bought the #4 paper."
3,"This is instant drink with lots of ginger flavor it it.  In some ways it is almost like drinking ginger tea without the tea bag. Drink has very dark color and in my cuup it almost looked like coffee.  Taste is very interesting.  If you like ginger already, you will enjoy strong peppery ginger taste.  What is unusual about this drink is that it has a very sweet aftertaste.  For me personally, it was too sweet.  I could not find a list of ingredients to confirm if this drink uses any artificial sweateners and that is why I doubt I would try drinking it again.  I just was not sure what is the calorie intake for this beverage.<br /><br />If calories are of no concern to you, than this is definitely a fine drink to try.  All you do is pour hot water and it's done."
3,"These are a nice healthy snack alternative to chips or cookies.  I even gave them to my daughter since she was about 8 months instead of ""puffs""  Any moisture changes the consistency though so in humid Houston you need to finish the pack once you open it."
3,"I bought a few of these scratchers for my kitties for Christmas, and they were a hit. In our combined household there are 8 cats, some of whom are scratchers, some are not. Of those who are scratchers, they immediately took to the Kong. I put a bit of catnip on it to entice them, but I'm not sure it was needed; they were intrigued by the incline-design, and by the toy inside, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, is not a plush mouse as pictured but rather a ""pom"" ball made of crunchy paper. At the time of this review, three months later, none of the pom balls have survived their fastening to the inside of the scratcher, but they still serve a purpose as loose kitty toys. (As a side note, I didn't buy this as a replacement for couch-scratching, so I can't comment on its effectiveness in that regard; I bought it as a fun toy. I'm not sure there IS a replacement for couch-scratching; I figure with 8 cats, couch-scratching goes along with the territory, and I'm ok with that.)<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned the ""flimsy"" design of these scratchers, so I won't belabor the point except to agree that yes, the all-cardboard design IS flimsy indeed, and along with this, only one of the scratchers I received was put together properly. The foot-base of the second scratcher was haphazardly taped on, and on the third, it was missing entirely. I did find it later, loose in the shipping box, but by then I'd already secured the foot-base myself using packaging tape.<br /><br />The one thing I'd like to point out which I haven't seen mentioned in any other review is the MESS these scratchers make. The kitties love them, sure, but as they scratch they tear up bits and pieces of paper from the scratching tray which then get strewn all over the room. (Again, no one has mentioned this, but there is a customer picture in the product description which shows this phenomenon quite clearly.) Now, if you're someone who vacuums every day, this might not be a concern for you...but if you're someone like me, who vacuums once every week (or so), then man, you are going to have a mess on your hands.<br /><br />I'm rather surprised no one else has commented on this; maybe you all vacuum regularly, in which case I applaud you. But it's definitely something I will take into consideration for future scratchers, which is why I'm only giving this one three stars...five stars from the kitties, one from me. In the future, I'd be ""inclined"" (ahem) to buy a similar design, this time with a carpeted surface (and a sturdier foundation), if such a thing exits. I have a couple of stand-up carpeted scratching posts, but the Kongs seem to get the most workouts, and I think that's because of the incline-design, not so much the scratching surface. We have a flat cardboard scratcher that we've had for years, and it gets so little use that the cardboard ""shedding"" isn't a concern at all.<br /><br />Still, I'll continue to keep these around for now and occasionally vacuum up the accumulated debris until they're shredded beyond usability, because...well...the cats DO love them, and happy cats make for happy people. :)"

3,"First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.  It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not)."
3,"Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work."
3,"This flavor was just okay, definitely not my favorite. The chocolate flavor is hard to taste, however when its brewing - it smells great! Also, not bold enough for me."
3,"I have only had this coffee twice now, but I'm not that impressed at the moment. I drink all of my coffee through the French Press method, so keep that in mind when reading my review.<br /><br />At roughly 9.60/lb I was expecting reasonably decent coffee. As anyone who drinks coffee knows, coffee has gotten pretty expensive over the last year or so. I judge all my coffee based primarily on taste as well as taste/cost. For a frame of reference, I love Peets coffee, but the cost is simply too much to make it worthwhile for me to enjoy drinking it all the time. Most of the Peets blends I enjoy cost roughly 14-15/lb.<br /><br />The description of the coffee states ""medium roast, chocolate notes."" I would say this coffee is most definately a medium roast - and it may even verge on being a medium light roast, at least the beans I got. In terms of chocolate notes, I haven't had a mocha-java style coffee in awhile, so I am not an expert on chocolate notes in coffee. But, I could not really taste any subtle chocolate notes in the coffee. Maybe it was the French Press method of preparation, I do not know.<br /><br />Overall, I have a hard time rating this coffee. For the price, I wanted it to be better than it is. But when I think about price again, for a ""really good"" I would have to pay 50% more than this price.<br /><br />I think if I could, I would give it like 3.5 or 3.8 stars."
3,"Purchased this in hopes of flavoring coffee without sweetening it.I didn't find the flavor to be all that amazing but it was ok.If you made coffee with it then asked me to guess the flavor I wouldnt be able to.Maybe because I know its supposed to be macadamia nut that Im looking for the flavor and can find it?In the end I am still trying to find  good macadamia nut flavor."
3,"well, i got excited when i saw these at whole foods.  Popped em open and gave some to my 9 mos old.  After i reviewed the ingredient list I saw it contains wheat.  Oh well.  sticking with the plum organic puffs for now."
3,"Upon arrival ate one. Had one recently which was good. However the one from the box i received was not as tasteful. It stuck to my teeth which made it difficult."
3,"My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it."
3,"Can't say I really love them. A little too sweet and too thick as a taste...<br />But good calorie count."
3,"It's okay...not my favorite for sure.......not as mellow as I like.  It is priced better than most but probably won't buy it again."
3,"I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewer say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.<br /><br />Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!<br /><br />We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are."
3,"I love the smooth yet granular feel of this body wash. I do feel like it cleans well and I haven't had any of the negative reactions to it that others here have. What I dislike most about the product is that is really doesn't smell good, in my opinion. The fragrance is Old Spice-ish and I just don't like it. I feel like the fragrance is too chemically strong. The first time I used it I though, ""I'd better not strike a match right after using the product"" because literally it feels like you're covered in chemicals."
3,"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!"
3,"Yes this is a good deal on coffee, but at least for this variety and roast I was kind of let down.<br />I like a dark roast on coffee, French/Full City/Italian. When I opened up this bag I was pleased with the aroma and the oil on the bean. The brew itself was good, but I couldn't shake the burnt after taste, this kinda ruined the next cup for me."
3,"I've had curry before, perhaps a different type of curry, because this is not what I remember curry to taste like. This particular curry was thick as I remember it, and perhaps it was different because it its dry beef curry and not the chicken curry I am use to.<br /><br />I found the taste to be very rich. It was alright. I didn't care for the pieces of leaves, whatever it was, that was in the soft. I thought after a while, they would soften up like scallions, or something along those lines, but they didn't. It was a bit of a pain having to stop and pick them out of my mouth.<br /><br />Made it for hubby and he seemed to like it. However, he agrees that we won't be in a hurry to run out and buy the product. I imagine you'd have to be an avid Curry fan to be excited for this product. For me, it was just okay."
3,"it took our dog about a week to figure this out. once she got it, she loved it and it kept her busy for a long time. the only problem is that it got moldy and when i tried to clean it, the rope never dried and the mold got worse. had to throw it out."
3,"My sister and I did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it, and we couldn't tell the difference between these and the two other brands I had on hand. I wouldn't buy them again."
3,"This is a tough popcorn. It's not bad just not the best. I have a popper that is a dome type with a wire sweeper that goes round and round. Most of the oil and salt stays in the bottom of the popper and never comes in contact with the corn kernels at the  bottom long enough to get on the popped corn. It is randomly spread and half of it is like air popped corn and tasteless."
3,"If you're not into a healthy lifestyle, get these - they are DELICIOUS! ""You can't eat just one!""<br />It contains MSG and other ""stuff."" - You've been warned! It's very delicious, though..."
3,"Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me."
3,"The fingers were good but got very dry quickly. They were very much like baklava."
3,"Oh man, what have you done? High Fructose Corn Syrup, dang when did that happen?<br /><br />I have eaten these things for years it seems, in salads and mainly right out of the<br />jar. I've tried very hard to cut out HFCS from my diet, along with GMO's, but its<br />getting harder and harder to do it seems as these big food companies are getting<br />pretty tricky with the names and now that the Senate has refused to back a bill that<br />allows states to mandate labeling....but I'm getting sidetracked.<br /><br />These beets still taste great (5/5) but I refuse to support a company that puts this<br />garbage in our food supply. I guess I'll just have to figure out how to make my own,<br />but first I'll have to find the organic beets, or grow my own and then pray that the<br />FDA, EPA, and Homeland Security doesn't arrest me for growing my own food!<br /><br />Rant over, they still taste great, just wish they'd lose the corn syrup. BTW, Del Monte<br />still uses real sugar in their beets."
3,"I wouldn't have minded this as much had I not tried another brand of diet cocoa mixes. I bought a generic store brand (krogers) which had a richer chocolate taste and didn't clump up as much. I rather drink that instead of this..."
3,"The bars were decent.. but I had less than a month to eat all the bars..<br /><br />They were about to expire as soon as I got them..."
3,"The bar tastes good but not as strawberry as I imagined it would. I still enjoy the bar, but mango tastes better and that would be a 4-5 stars. If you like coconut this is a good snack bar. I eat these while hiking or working in the yard. They provide good healthy energy and taste delicious. I do not believe I would order strawberry again but I still enjoy the product."
3,"I had a bowl of these todasy for breakfast. I put two fried eggs on top and added a little hot sauce I made yesterday. The noodles have a decent firmness and the broth was tasty. The veggies weren't as plentiful as I would normally wish, but I couldn't complain; a good breakfast. 3.125 out of 5.0 stars is what I gave it on ramenrater.com."
3,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />these are easy to use and a convenient size. they are, however, a tad awkward to use since the package doesn't let you easily get to the stuff stuck in the bottom corners. a few times i have had to get out the snips and cut the package down the side to get that last chunk.<br /><br />it is NOT dry - there is some liquid in the package. it is a tad oily since [unlike what my stepdad always claimed] there really is such a thing as chicken fat. [*grin*] the amount of oil is not a problem - just a bit disconcerting when you need to wash the oil off your hands.<br /><br />rated a THREE since it is no more or less than expected.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
3,"So far I have tried the original and the onion, so I tried this one because it came with the lot I bought. Well, got to say, It is spicy and it hits your mouth right away, no building up to it. Surprisingly, I just don't see my self ""warming up"" to these. The good news is though, it does not leave that horrible hot feeling in your mouth. Once the sea weed is consumed the heat goes away."
3,"The box reads that Ahmad English Breakfast tea is ""a blend of Ceylon and other origin teas packed in Sri Lanka"".<br /><br />I've tried Twinings' and Dilmah's English breakfast teas. I would rank Twinings first, followed by Dilmah and then Ahmad.<br /><br />Twinings has the best flavor and comes closest to the classic taste.<br /><br />Dilmah is decent, but doesn't taste as full bodied as Twinings.<br /><br />I didn't like Ahmad. It tasted more like Dilmah's Ceylon tea than English Breakfast Tea."
3,"My five dogs, Mastiff, 2 Labradoodles, 2 Blue Heeler puppies, all under 2 years of age, love Bully Sticks. I started purchasing them at Costco. When they stopped carrying them, for a several months, I purchased these from Amazon. Recently they have been thinner than the first ones I purchased. We go through several pounds a month. Costco has recently stared carrying them again. This batch at Costco, are mostly thick, some even Mastiff sized. In fact the 10 packages I purchased a month ago didn't have many, Doodle sized, only huge. So I cut them in half for the Doodles and Blue heelers, now 5.5 mos old. But never mind, they switch them all out amongst themselves so I've stopped cutting them in half. I use a big tree branch hopper.<br /><br />I was going to order a few packages of the smaller diameter for the ""smaller"" dogs, here, but the last few packages we purchased at Costco had a few smaller diameter.<br /><br />My 1.5 year old Mastiff finishes one of these smaller ones in a few minutes, if he doesn't get distracted. I then have to give him another and then another. I would rather give them all one large one. When the smaller dogs tire of chewing they will leave the stick, and sooner or later, another finds it for an extra treat. Thank goodness they get along well enough that there is no fighting when only one has a stick; otherwise I would be handing them out throughout the evening and next morning. They get the Bully Sticks when we are home to supervise.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase from Costco as long as they carry them and only purchase these when I have to. I've ordered the ""premium"" sticks but they cost quite a bit more."
3,"Disappointed that 10-15% are halves and pieces.  Obviously Planters QC standards are not set high. Sea salt or whatever,  still a bit too salty also. Will NOT reorder."
3,"The label for this product clearly states that it is made from concentrate. There's no mention of this fact in Amazon's product description. I purchased the product thinking it was not from concentrate, and am not happy about my mistake. It's kind of my own fault for not reading some of the reviews first, but it was late at night and I was sleepy and ready to go to bed. Still, I get tired of this type of inaccuracy in the descriptions that Amazon provides. My experience has been that it's more predominately a problem for food items than other products."
3,"They're ok, but not much flavor in the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor. I might try the multigrain flavor."
3,"As an adult man, I have to say that this is not the world's greatest product. It is very sweet and has a strange chemical taste. On the other hand, I am a high school teacher and I let my students try it. They LOVED it and wanted more. That's why I'm giving MIO Liquid Peach Tea 3 stars. 1 from me + 5 from my students =3. A great idea but only a so-so execution."
3,"The instructions on how to prepare this box of macaroni and cheese are basically the same as the regular Kraft mac and cheese - so it's very easy. And of course it's great that vegetables are included in the pasta, making it a bit more healthy than the regular. The texture of the noodles was slightly mushier, so I'd recommend undercooking them a bit if you want them to be more like the regular noodles. I also thought the sauce seemed more bland, not sure why that was. Since I only rarely each box macaroni and cheese, and since I did like this veggie-containing alternative a bit less, I'd probably just rather stick to the regular Kraft mac and cheese."
3,"candy came fast but was not what was pictured. It was the new variety with mango and pineapple, NO lime or red apple things. bummer"
3,"coconut palm sugar blonde comes to you brown it looks like raw sugar...but diabetics can use it or people who have a allergic reaction to cane sugar...i gave 2 bags to relatves ,open one for sugar bowl..i do not like it  but my daughter uses it she likes it...i prefer raw sugar.i have diabetics in my family so i share with them..an 2 who have allergic reaction to cane sugar when they eat it....so it is helpful to them ..my daughter sweetens her herbal teas with it.she uses palm sugar or stevia."
3,"...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity."
3,"The Izze Pomegranate drink reminded me somewhat of cranberry juice. The flavor is much more intense, however, and I didn't really like it on its own. This may sound crazy but mixing it with half Diet Mt. Dew makes a great drink!"
3,"The drink is very nice, tasteful and sweet. What I did not like is the stains it makes, even when being careful mixing the drink; the powder gets on the sink and leaves a fine pink dust. Stains on fingers or mouth-corners cannot be removed! Be aware of this, do not give to kids (no artificial sweeteners for kids anyway!) or spill on cloths."
3,"I just tried this flavor. Clear and cold with just a trace of flavoring and not too sweet - adult taste, not a kiddie juice drink. There is no strong coconut flavor or aroma.<br /><br />Zico makes a great novelty mixer (vodka & bourbon too) but seems a bit pricey for daily use."
3,"These are my favorite kind of rice pasta. The dehydrated vegetable powder added to the pasta makes the pasta so much more flavorful then the regular kind. A winner! It is now Aug 20th 2012 why is this exact pasta that was already on expensive side over $3 for a small 12 oz package is now over $8. In 4 months the price has almost tripled! I hope this is a horrible mistake! and not some crazy inflation! $7-$8 for rice pasta. Who can afford that?"
3,"I have a Virgin Mary almost every day and a true Bloody Mary maybe once or twice a week. I've experimented with a lot of different tomato juices, hot sauces, and spices but I've only tried a few Bloody Mary mixes.<br /><br />I recently purchased both the Tabasco Spicy Bloody Mary mix and the Mr & Mrs T Spicy Bloody Mary mix to see what (if anything) I was missing. The Tabasco mix was simply horrid but the Mr & Mrs T was pretty good. It has a nice blend of heat versus sweetness (tomatoes working against hot peppers). However any other flavors (if they exist) seemed lost in the Mr & Mrs Ts mix. A true three star product - good but not great.<br /><br />I'd recommend Mr/Mrs Ts to anyone who MUST purchase a mix. It's a good one. But I don't recommend you purchase any mix!<br />.<br /><br />I'd recommend a simple recipe using just two ingredients - your preferred tomato juice and a great hot sauce but the devil, of course, is in the details.<br />.<br />SIMPLE BLOODY MARY RECIPE - Two Ingredients:<br /><br />1.) Tomato Juice or V8 juice - I prefer the low sodium variety of V8 but that is NOT a critical factor. Use whatever juice you like.<br />Actually the lowest priced cans of tomato juice at my local supermarket have proven really excellent! Go figure.<br /><br />2.) A High Quality Hot Sauce. Using a better than average hot sauce is absolutely key. I strongly recommend (if you do not already have a favorite) one of the following (I've taste tasted about 30 different ones and below is my short list of favorites which are also readily available:<br /><br />My LIST of ""High Quality"" Hot sauces:<br /><br />  a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced with a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. It really makes the virgin/bloody mary quite special. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section!<br /><br /> b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section<br /><br /> c) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.<br /><br /> d) Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce - a well know, national brand. The Chipotle pepper is smoked and has a unique flavor. Widely available and worth a try. There are many other brands of Chipotle sauces.<br /><br /> e) El Yacateco Green<br /><br />That is simple as it gets. A juice and a dash of a really good hot sauce. This is not only far better than the Tabasco mix (which is horrid) but it is also better than the Mr/Mrs Ts Bloody Mary mix!<br /><br />An added bonus of mixing your own ----- you can adjust the heat level to your individual preferences. You can't do that with a mix.<br /><br />Have some fun by adding Worchester sauce, horseraddish, etc to your home mix"
3,"It's evident that this product is boiled down and crystallized before being packaged and sold. There are trace elements that are supposed to make it better than regular sugar. If you want an alternative sweetener that is delicious as well, try Coconut Secret Coconut Sugar Crystals (it's listed as Raw Vegan). It's good enough, unfortunately, to eat with a spoon. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XBBAUM"">Raw Coconut Crystals 12 Oz 340 Gram</a>"
3,"some beans were dried out. The first one I took out was so dry that when I went to get pulp out of bean it crumbled apart. I'm glad others had such great luck with Beanilla, not sure I will try them again. I love the taste of the tahitian vanilla compared to the others I've tried."
3,"Nature's Path Organic Optimum cereal has an impeccable pedigree for the health conscious.<br />According to Nature's Path the cereal has ""Certified Organic Goodness.""<br />This means:<br />No synthetic pesticides<br />No synthetic herbicides<br />No artificial preservatives or additives<br />No genetically engineered seeds or ingredients<br />No irradiation<br /><br />Optimum is high fiber, low fat, and whole grain cereal with 25% less sugar than the previous recipe. The only sweetener listed in the ingredients is ""organic evaporated cane juice.""<br /><br />Fine. Optimum is probably a healthy breakfast choice and doesn't contain any of the nasties that the health conscious take pains to avoid. All of the cereals qualities and nutritional benefits are important to me too, but so is flavor.<br />After eating Optimum blueberry cinnamon cereal, I'm left to wonder why can't one have good taste and good nutrition in an organic cereal?<br /><br />My first taste of Optimum was straight out of the box. It didn't make much of an impression. The anticipated burst of cinnamon and blueberry flavors just weren't there. There's not improvement when the cereal is swimming in milk. The taste is bland and unimpressive. If one eats the blueberries individually, one can taste the blueberries though they are far from sweet. As far as cinnamon flavor goes, I detected none, not even a hint. It's also obvious that there's been a reduction in sugar content. I sprinkle sugar on this cereal, but it does little to improve the taste or eating enjoyment.<br /><br />Should you but this cereal? If health, nutrition, and organic content are priorities for you, but all means eat Optimum.<br />If you want the pizzazz of cinnamon or blueberry flavor, Optimum will seriously disappoint."
3,"The coconut oil arrived in good condition.  It had a stronger taste than conventional cooking oils that I did not care for."
3,"Wasn't good, but wasn't bad. The main thing is that it doesn't have the nitrites the other jerky has and is all natural!"
3,"I am from the UK so salad cream is a staple!  I would have given a 5 star rating but when this arrived, all 6 bottles had a shelf life of 3 months"
3,"Seems like the Keurig systems lend themselves to dark roasts - however, the near burnt flavor element never worked for me. I was excited to try out this light roast (enough for 48 packs of 'trial') - and indeed I loved the flavor if you stick to the small 6 oz cup size. The coffee gets too weak and watery at any of my regular sizes (middle or right-but-one button on the B70) - this is a coffee that could do with an 'extra bold' rating to up the quantity of coffee in the cup.<br />My current alternative for this is Green Mountain's 'Our Blend' - which does seem to have got it right!"
3,"Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking."
3,"This is a very good product and if one likes the flavour. it would do what the sports drinks cLAIM to do!!<br />It would also be excellent for anyone who is ill and needs electrolytes etc.<br />Since the flavour or lack of is my reason for not personally caring for this, I would suggest TRY it to see if it's your 'cup of tea'. IF so, it is a decent healthy drink."
3,"When I was opening the boxes I noticed there were some Tully's House Blend KCups included in each box. Besides that issue - I enjoy the Tully's Frnch Roast."
3,"I have been vegan for years so I have had my fair share of vegan treats.  These wernt all that good but they wasnt nasty.  I like my cookies to have moisture and these were dry and crumbly.  Maybe if you get them fresh from the place they would taste better."
3,"As far as taste goes, this is by far my favorite cereal, but despite the whole grain (very little apparently), it has very little fiber (zero,actually, according to the box itself), so I usually don't eat it.  Too bad."
3,"this syrup is good, must be shaken for long time to get mixed.  going to try making my own from coconut milk sugar and heat.<br />quite expensive for amt of syrup.  seems to need cutting with some sugar free maple.  mild but thin enough to cut thru this thick coconut syrup.  its OK, but not largely impressed."
3,"Have ordered twice before...first time they were nice and soft, second time, HARD!Hopefully by now the company is aware of this. Gonna try again and if they are hard, I will never order these again."
3,"I should start off by saying that I am not a huge oatmeal fan in general. That being said, I'd bought a box of another kind of oatmeal from the Better Oats company and really enjoyed it. Hoping I'd finally found a way that I could like oatmeal and being impressed with the Omega 3 content, I decided to see what other products were available from Better Oats. I came here to Amazon and was excited to see this chocolate oatmeal (I love chocolate). I was impressed with all of the good reviews and so I decided that if I could find it for cheaper at my local grocery store then I would try it out. I found it for $1.30 for one of the five-pack boxes which was much cheaper than here on Amazon. I bought some and then went home to try it out. I did not like it at all. To me it tasted a little like non-fat instant chocolate pudding with soggy Wheaties mixed it. It was that consistency too. In fact, I'm not convinced that I'd be able to pass a taste test between the two. I was really hungry which usually makes me much more willing to accept tastes that I might not otherwise like, but even after not having anything to eat all day I still just picked at this and eventually dumped the bowl out and went hungry. I should also say that I followed the microwave directions and not the stove-top ones, so you might have better luck that way. I gave it three stars because as I said before, I'm not a big oatmeal fan and so that could have effected my judgement. It looks like other people liked it really well so if you're an oatmeal lover then this might be worth a try, but if, like me, you have so-so feelings about oatmeal in general, then I don't think this will change your mind. I will say that the original oatmeal I tried by Better Oats was the Oat Revolution! Apples & Cinnamon flavor  and it was delicious."
3,"These tartlet cookies are cute. However, they're really hard, so I can't really break them into smaller pieces for our Pekingese. I generally just scrape some of the icing off for him and give the ""crust"" part to our Chow. Then he picks up her crumbs if he finishes the icing first."
3,"This dog food was so well liked by the dogs that they wouldn't stop eating. I never had this problem with Purina Dog Chow.  I actually had to regulate their portions because the dogs wouldn't stop eating it.  I can only assume that this stuff is loaded with something sweet to make these dogs act like this??  I eventually mixed it into their Dog Chow and I won't be purchasing anymore because of their love of this dog food."
3,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas/10th Birthday present... a Tug-a-Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug, so I didn't buy those."
3,"I didn't realize these bones were so thin. I had assumed they were chew bones, but instead were actually a treat. If you are looking for something to occupy your dog for an hour, these aren't it. My 11 week old puppy chainsawed through one in no time. I really needed something to keep him chewing for a while, something that wasn't my couch or shoes. I'll keep looking..."
3,"the flax seeds were nice but the bags were not sealed properly they were all over the card board box"
3,"I really like my Senseo coffee pots and up until recently, I have been very pleased with Senseo coffee pods, too. I buy quite a few cases every year and have been for over 5 years.<br />But, recently I have been receiving lots more packages with more than 1 pod improperly sealed so that there are lots of grounds in the bag that make all the other pods messier to use - and you are unable to use the mostly empty ones. When I finally reached someone at Senseo, (on my 3rd attempt), they were very apologetic, but I've yet to hear if there is any explanation or will be any efforts on Senseo's part to improve this.<br /><br />This is very discouraging, since it is a good product - but now I dread opening a new bag. I have purchased some Eco-pods to fill myself in case the situation with Senseo's coffee pods does not get corrected. These you just fill with bulk coffee that I'll buy in the grocery store."
3,"Rather bland tasting, although I havent tried to use it in some of the suggested ways. For a cooking oil it probably is OK. But it is expensive, so I don't think I'll buy it again.<br />The shipping was fast and I'll always buy other products from Amazon due to excellent service and prices."
3,"Sure disappointed with Amazon as they sent me a collection of Donut House coffee and not the Cinnamon Roll as I asked.  What is up with that?"
3,"...Amazon fell off the service wagon on this one...the  listing indicates that you're buying SIX boxes of the tea...what I received the last THREE times I ordered it, however, was only ONE box of tea...and this was despite the packing list clearly indicating that there should be SIX boxes in the shipment...customer service refunded my money but COULDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM...amazing!!...anyway, the tea is great and deserves five stars...Amazon's service is pathetic and should get less than one."
3,"I like ginger in certain situations, but I'm not sure this is one of them.  That's why I gave this 3 stars - I don't know if I like it, but I'm pretty sure I don't hate it.  I tried this hot, and it was soothing, but the ginger/honey/lemon flavor is odd to me.  Not bad, just odd.  And not odd like salt & vinegar chips that end up being addictive - just take it or leave it odd.<br /><br />If you like ginger & lemon tea, you'll probably like this.  But if you're not a big fan of either, maybe getting a package of six boxes at once is not the best idea."
3,"So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak, and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while. I finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it. Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!!"
3,"I'm an avid vanilla freak, and this cake looked like a score. However ,the top would not become firm despite following its directions. Also had a mealy consistency. Not a fan. Half my cake was tossed in the garbage. I recommend Dowd & Rogers cake mix, and 'Cause You're Special cake mixes, because we know you are special :)"
3,"Our first order of this was fresh and tasty. We also enjoyed the versatility of switching out the noodles for brown rice, and tossing with sauteed chunks of chicken breast with either broccoli or fresh spinach.  Thought we had a winner.<br /><br />But then, an order arrived with two of the noodle packets punctured with the noodles growing green, fuzzy mold all over.  Disgusting.<br /><br />Then the most recent order, June 2012, arrived with rancid sauce and rancid peanuts unfit for consumption.<br />Now we're not sure if we're game to try our luck with these any further. Probably not.<br /><br />As the for the spicy heat some people mention--it's really great, and we actually add a few drops of ""hot"" seasoned sesame oil right right before serving to make it even hotter, more intense and more enjoyable.<br /><br />The problem is the unpredictable quality control."
3,"For as long as I remember, I've loved Joray fruit rolls.  Back in the seventies, they only came in Apricot flavor.  Now they're in a variety of flavors.  In my opinion, the cherry flavor is very tasty, but not quite as flavorful as the others.  Grape is still my personal favorite."
3,"This was not as full bodied and rich as I had hoped for an espresso. Really only a medium roast level as well."
3,"First off, I get lots of fiber in my diet through fresh fruits and vegetables as well as flax seed. But this cereal gives me the worst gas I've ever experienced in my life. Foulest-smelling ever and it lasts from morning till night! I thought the gas was because of all the fruits and veggies I was eating, but as soon as I eliminated the cereal from my diet, voila! Gas be GONE!<br />However, it doesn't affect my husband. He absolutely loves it with chopped banana. So really, it depends on the person. I think I do have a sensitive stomach, so maybe that's why it only affected me.<br />As for taste, it's pretty good. Kind of chewy, but like I said, really good with chopped banana."
3,"I just opened my case of Mighty Dog and to my disappointment-9 out of 24 cans are smashed so bad I am not sure it is safe to feed this to my dog. If Amazon is going to continue selling this item I think greater care should be taken with the cans."
3,"This has a wonderful chocolate aroma but the taste is weak and disappoints.  For those who don't like strong coffee, it might be good for occasions."
3,"We use pretzel M&Ms in this for our three year olds during potty training.  It works 85% of the time.  Sometimes the M&Ms get stuck in the spiral.  The problem is that there is no way to get into the spiral part of the machine to get them loose.  There were a couple times where the M&M got stuck and we thought it would render the entire machine useless but we played around with it and luckily, it came out.  The coin mechanism is also inconsistant.  85% of the time, when you put a coin in it works.  Sometimes though, you have to turn it twice."
3,"The mix is, indeed, excellent. Super easy to prepare and bake. I usually double the size of each scone.<br /><br />But price at Amazon is really high. We can get these at the local Giant Food for about $4.00. Giant only has the blueberry and lemon poppyseed, though. If not for the $10 - $12 price tag at Amazon, I would try some of the other flavors."
3,"I was disappointed since i had been drinking another brand which had a bolder taste but this was good coffee."
3,"I think these must be instant coffee b/c the cups feel empty when they're done, unlike the coffee ones which feel a little heavier b/c of the grounds and filter inside. Anyway, they taste like instant coffee and hot chocolate - not the greatest combination. I would also like it to be a bit creamier. With some creamer added they are tolerable. I won't buy them again, too bad I bought 24."
3,"I converted to drinking only loose leaf tea last year and gave this gift pack a try. While it was decent, I have since had better and will probably not be ordering it again.<br /><br />For one, it is impossible to tell the age of the teas in the tins. For Pu-erh, that's not such a big deal, but for green teas and the Jasmine, you want normally want to get a batch that is a fresh as possible. PierMall is a big reseller of products from around the world, and there is no telling how long what you get had been sitting in some huge warehouse, slowly losing flavor. Another consideration is that you get a random sampling of Chinese teas, no the specific types that is implied by their Amazon listing. If you visit their website, you will see that they draw from this selection:<br /><br />* China Black Tea<br />* Tiekuanyin (Iron Goddess of Mercy)<br />* Oolong<br />* Lung Ching DragonWell Green Tea<br />* Yunnan Pu-erh<br />* Jasmine Tea<br />* White Tea<br />* PuErh Tea with Chrysanthmum<br />* Lychee Black Tea<br />* Rose Black Tea<br />* Rose Green Tea<br />* Osthsmum Green Tea<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I'd like a little more certainty when buying a product. If you are new to tea and trying different varieties out, or are getting this as a gift, then it isn't such a big deal. Of what I received, the Oolong was the best. The Pu-erh was okay, though nothing special, and the Jasmine has a slight aftertaste, leading me to believe it was artificially flavored. Good Jasmine tea should be flavored by the scent of the flower, nothing else. The green and blacks were just okay.<br /><br />You could do worse if you were to buy teabags, but not much. I would recommend buying good loose leaf tea from dedicated tea vendors who are more upfront about what exactly they are selling you. At this price, you really can't expect to get quality tea. But if you are looking for an inexpensive gift for someone who doesn't know their tea, you could do worse. At least afterward you have some cute little tins in which to store future teas! It may cost a little more, but I think one would be much better served by ordering samples from a company like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YT18B4"">Heavenly Teas</a> or Adagio."
3,"I've worked with different types of fondants and if you are reading reviews because you are new to the Fondant Cake process, here are some things to keep in mind:<br />1. Satin Ice is Yummier than most<br />2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many<br />3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;)<br /><br />I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice: ""I hate you SATAN Ice!!"" Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks.<br /><br />Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with:<br />1. Wilton's<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. Homemade Marshmallow<br /><br />Fondant's I've worked with in order of yummieness:<br />1. Homemade Marshmallow<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. (distantly) Wilton's<br /><br />I would recommend the tutorial on Satin Ice website, really great:<br />[...]<br /><br />If you are only buying Satin Ice to sculpt edible animals, than this would be a great one. For first time cake coverings, try Wilton's, get things down then come back to Satin Ice.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and good luck on your cake adventures!<br />Jackie<br />domesticfits (dot)  com"
3,"I brought this ready-to-eat meal to work with me yesterday for lunch. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Nothing was really terrible, rotten, or all that off-putting. It just wasn't good. My friend and I had joked while waiting for this to arrive that it was an ""adult lunchable"". If you've never had a lunchable, the idea is a little packet of ingredients the kid can put together in his own way, e.g. pizza or cracker sandwiches. They were always very bland and the idea sounded better than it actually tasted. These ended up being exactly the same way.<br />The Late July crackers are tasty (similar to a Ritz), and the salmon spread is alright. I did eat most of it, so it must have been somewhat appealing, though I couldn't tell you how. It was VERY fishy, which I don't mind, though others might.<br />The dry roasted edamame beans are so bland, I can't imagine eating them in any other capacity. Just pure salt and not much other flavor. A bit like eating those styrofoam packing peanuts.<br />The fruit and nut mixture was pretty good, though the number of banana chips was disappointingly low (two in the whole bag). The ginger peanuts were a strange new taste that I couldn't quite get into, but they were tasty.<br />By the time I got to the chocolate I was tired of trying these strangely bland foods. It's dark chocolate. Not much you can screw up there.<br />If you're in a hurry or if you're trying to get your kid to eat better (whole box is 410 calories), these are decent in a pinch. But I'd rather take the extra time to prep my own lunch, or hell, have a lean cuisine."
3,"I like it, but.... there's a little bit too much of a sharp after taste. Even adding a ton of sugar didn't make up for it entirely. The product still has good flavor, but I'd gladly take Lipton Spiced Chai over this, if only the Lipton came in a K-Cup."
3,"I was a real fan of this line of dog treats until one day, I noticed on the back of the bag, the fine print, that read, ""MADE IN CHINA"". How can a dog treat that states cage free chickens and all natural come from China? Its rare to hear of a cage free chicken coup in China of all places. And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least. I have since found better alternatives that I can be more comfortable in giving my dog, such as Plato Natural Organic Chicken made here in the USA."
3,"I've heard about how good Oolong tea is for you and I heard this was a good brand so I tried it.  It tastes fine -- not grassy like green tea and not bitter like some black teas -- but I was WAY to sensitive to the amount of caffeine in it.  It kept me awake and buzzing for hours.  If you are used to caffeine, it probably won't affect you too much, but if you're like me, you should get something decaffeinated."
3,"Amazon lists salmon as the second ingredient. It is not! Would have passed if I had known that! My cat likes it so-so..."
3,"I buy the flavored coffees, not just for the taste, but for the aroma that it leaves through out the house.I can bearley smell it. I won't be buying it again. My Son likes it better than I do, it's just O.K. for me."
3,"After trying the chipotle one I decided to try this one. It was good but rather salty for my taste. Also it kind of reminded me of tarter sauce a little. Though I am sure many would like this, it is just too over powering for my palate. I love mayo and go through it quickly but these have been sitting in my pantry for a LOOOONG time. I opened one months ago and have only used it maybe 4 times. Not sure what I can do to cut the flavor and salt. Maybe add some sour cream or better yet Greek yogurt. I am not one to let things go to waste ( yes the true spelling of the word WASTE. So many times I see reviews with WAIST rather than waste. Has become a pet peeve of mine. lol ) Anyway 3 stars, had it been more balanced and not so overpowering and salty it might have been 5 stars."
3,"Decent tea.  I think the ginger overpowers a little.  Average to slightly above average herbal tea."
3,"Whoah.  I had NO IDEA there was Splenda in this!  Maybe that's why I don't particularly care for it.<br />I mean, it's good, and drinkable, but... not my cup of tea... (you see what I did there??)<br /><br />The initial smell is awesome, but I do prefer the Wawa or Strabucks Chai Tea..<br /><br />However, my boyfriend LOVES this stuff.  He drinks it in a huge cafe mug, 2 (well 4 counting all that cream) discs at a time!  And then thinks about going back for more!<br /><br />Hey, Tassimo sells Starbucks products, maybe they will eventually get a Starbuck's Chai Tea Disc set for us to enjoy!?"
3,"I'm giving three stars because when I snapped off a piece my rat terrier/chihuahua loved it...but then, she loves everything!  My spaniel/chihuahua, well, he ate it but not with any enthusiasm.  Kinda played with it a bit.  He's a fickle eater with a sensitive stomach. That's why I am here.  PLATO DID NOT PROVIDE SERVING SIZE INFORMATION ON THE PACKAGE!  Yes, they pat you on the back for taking the time to read their label.  But did they read it before printing?  Clearly you would give a small dog less than a large dog but how much?  I don't know how rich these are and if they'll upset my little ones stomach if I give him a 1/4, 1/2 stick a couple bites?  I have no clue! So I attempt to contact the manufacturer (don't even try to do it from their label because it only has a mailing address!  ARGH!).  This means going online to find them.  After finding a phone number and email address I call.  Ring...ring...ring..ring...ring...ring...no voicemail..no human! ARGH again!  So I resorted to email to ask them what the serving size is. Then receive a return email that it can take up to 3 days for a reply while they make great dog treats.  I believe this since they don't answer even their phones!  The whole office must be chipping in! Unfortunately, I had no choice but to return them not knowing any info on serving sizes.  Thankfully, my pet store will take it back even though it's opened.  If you need servings, contact them first.  All in all, my one dog gives them 5 stars (she's the one who loves it all!) and the other a mere 2 stars.  I give it 0 for not providing the owners the information they need to treat their dog without making them sick :("
3,"... then these strips are for you.  A friend of mine introduced me to them, and admittedly, they taste pretty good, but the seitan has a color and texture that will make you think you are eating human flesh.  It's horrifying, and yet afterwards you'll be craving more, which is all the more horrifying.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for taste, 1 star for cannibalism... 3 stars overall."
3,"This is not tasting so bad, at least you do not think you are eating cardboard paper."
3,"Different flavor - not sure if want to acquire a taste for this, and would have to work at it."
3,"I am hooked on the Kashi Golean bars but this one is my least favorite of them. Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks. I nearly broke my front tooth (at least it felt that way) biting into them. I do agree it tastes good once you get a bite off, but it's not worth the toothache.<br /><br />Try the other flavors, they are good but think twice about this one."
3,"My  dogs love them.. They are pricey for a treat tho!<br />I did not notice any change on their teeth -plaque stayed the same.. even tho I gave it to my  dog 2 times a day for few months. Still needed to go to the vet for  deep teeth cleaning."
3,"Great taste, but not many of the treat clumps shown. It doesn't seem that the boxes got crushed at all, so it might just be the way the cereal is being made. Almost more like crumbs than anything else"
3,"I prefer coconut water to Gatorade or other sports drinks for re-hydration; in addition to being natural, they are packed with electrolytes and their taste is no better, no worse.<br /><br />Zico, however, is form concentrate.  Calling their product 'Pure Premium' seems very misleading when other products are actually pure and this one has been modified. If you're being frugal, this product works fine, but personally, I'd spare the extra few bucks and go with Vita Coco or One."
3,"The flakes are a healthy and quick breakfast to prepare, but the texture is pretty mushy, like baby food. I'd prefer to prep regular quinoa ahead of time and refrigerate it then heat it up with some honey and almond milk for breakfast. But overall the product is good quality and a decent value compared to health food store prices."
3,"Two years running I have purchased this kit from Walmart or Target for my kids to compete against each other in creating their holiday houses. (My daughter always informally wins the competition as my son eats too much of his candy before it's done ;) ) The Gingerbread is far to hard to eat for anyone with an ordinary bite, but that didn't stop the little guy. It's a cute kit, well made, each year there are slight differences in the supplies, but same house design - which is starting to bore my kids, so we may try another box kit or get bold an and make our own template & ""ginger bread"".<br /><br />BTW - we get ours at Walmart or Target for about $6 less than on Amazon, however with free Prime shipping here and not needing to run off to the store to buy this isn't a bad price."
3,"You'd be surprised what you can do with a three foot gummy worm! IT FEEDS A LOT OF KIDS! You can have a ton of fun with it."
3,"The lime is just kind of weird.  It has an artificial flavor (yes I know it is, but it doesn't need to taste like it!)Works fine in the machine it is just a flavor issue.  Their pink vanilla and blue raspberry are very good."
3,"I like a good strong cup of joe.  This is just a strong cup of average joe.  It is no Community coffee, no 8 o'clock coffee with the spoon standing straight up.  It is better than many other standard k cups.  But still I think there are better full bodied k cups out there."
3,"This buckwheat is very flavorful while uncooked. However, it is dried/roasted in such way that if you cook it the standard way you will end up with mush. You have to follow the recipe on the bag (or some variation of it) in order to get the grainy consistency. To me, this method of cooking is more complicated than what I am used to and to a certain degree compromises the flavor. I am used to the kind of buckwheat that you can cook in a rice steamer and it does not turn to mush.<br />I know in non-organic world there are better products. Not sure if there is any organic buckwheat that is better than this.<br />I absolutely love the cracked buckwheat variety by this company -- that kind is usually cooked to be mushy and there the drying/roasting method used by this company puts it well above anything else I tried."
3,"These sardines are great, especially for people who haven't had sardines before. I hardly notice the bones and skin. I eat 2-3 tins per week to help improve my cholesterol numbers. My favorite ways to eat these are with crackers and hot sauce or mustard."
3,"I love the Jack Link products, but this a bit on the dry side and not much of a BBQ taste."
3,"I suppose if you have to ask, you can't really afford<br />it.  I ordered two of them just in case they are small."
3,"bought the three flavor variety selection. All are ok...honey bbq,sea salt and jalapeno...my favorite being the barbq.Healthy alternative to regular chips. I probably won't buy them again because  I have  tried Pop Chips and they are more flavorful,although more expensive. They(smart fries) are a filling snack in the evening without the guilt. Other flavors might be ok....cheddar cheese seem like they might be interesting. Again, not up to Pop Chip quality in my opinion."
3,"I haven't noticed any special recovery benefits, but maybe I haven't worked out hard enough to notice the difference between this and anything else.<br /><br />However, the kids do leave it alone for me to use, whereas they tear into the sports drinks, as well as the regular chocolate milk with wild abandon, so it does have that going for it, as well as the decent taste."
3,"I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk. The flavor was mild, pleasant, but for me, the taste was too bland, did not stand out. Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore, not ultimately satisfying. I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite."
3,"Conveniently single cup packaging, perfect for traveling, smells great when you unseal the foil packet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives. The down side is that the packaging is appropriate for 'pod' brewing only and ends up brewing a pretty weak cup of coffee at that (maybe I'm biased, since I tend to brew Gevalia Dark Roast at about 7-8 scoops per 12 cup pot). I think that, at best, this is an average cup of coffee. P-)"
3,"I thought that this pancake and waffle mix was very good. I was able to add the ingredients that I wanted to make it more personal. I appreciate the fact that amazon has made it possible for small companies to sell their products online."
3,"I love coffee and I start my day with it and I drink half a pot in the evenings too.  So I was excited to try this blend but it was not as exciting as the description on their website. The scent was fragrant and inviting but the taste fell flat. After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the ""floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish"" as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.  Try Komodo Dragon by Starbucks instead. Bob Marley needs to stick with his day job."
3,"To be honest, my baby didn't really love all of these at first. He's pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didn't love all of these.  But as he's gotten older, he's gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here."
3,"Great rich flavor. Long time user but a 25%<br />breakage rate-never had cups do this before.<br />I noticed the cups seem to be more ""puffy""<br />with air, perhaps this is the problem."
3,"I was not really impressed by the Snax candy it left a bitter taste in your mouth after you finished it."
3,"I was disappointed by the texture of this product. It is very thick and has more of a milkshake taste than an iced coffee. I actually found I like it better just stirring a little less of the mix in with a cup of hot coffee."
3,"I like the taste of these honey drops. They are just sweet enough, and make my throat feel good, after a day of teaching.  But I really do not feel any noticeable difference in my energy or alertness level, after using them. So enjoy them for what they are, but take the product name with a grain of salt."
3,"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce Extra Hot has set itself apart from the others.  It has a satisfying flavor and is neither too hot nor too mild.  This is a product that I can recommend."
3,"My rice packet did not come with any cooking instructions, so I googled some instructions (and I am glad I did, as it involved several steps).  The rice was wonderful once I spent the time to figure out how to prepare it!"
3,"Tried it to try to do a White Mocha like Starbucks and never could get it right and very messy to dispense."
3,"Voss taste great, clean, but you can purchase this on clearance at grocery stores in florida in the plastic containers, not sure about if its available in glass in grocery store......."
3,"If this had been the first MIO I tried, I wouldn't have risked any other flavor.<br /><br />The concept is great, sugar and caffeine free, portable and an option for people who dislike plain water or who are on sugar-restricted diets. Since hydration is an issue for people who drink too much coffee or soda, it's a great idea.<br /><br />This flavor reminds me of candy more than fruit. How some fruit flavored candies don't taste anything like the fruit they are supposed to be. The artificial sweetener makes the chemical taste worse. I liked the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG"">MIO Mango Peach)</a>, this missed the mark for me.<br /><br />So why two extra stars? My son disagrees with me, and likes the peach flavor quite a bit. He also likes it mixed into homemade yogurt.<br /><br />If you like sweetness and flavor, this maybe better for you than it was for me. I'll stick the Mango Peach when I'm out and want a bit of flavor and sweetness. When at home, I prefer chilled brewed herbal teas to hydrate with flavor."
3,"I didn't realize that this was a wet sea salt or that wet sea salt doesn't work well in regular salt mills.  My salt mill produced very little volume when using this salt and even after washing the mill thoroughly it had to be replaced because of what I assume to be resulting corrosion.  I did some research and learned that this is typical when using wet sea salt in a regular salt mill and that Peugeot has developed a wet salt mill to address this problem, however, it seemed to me that the reviews were mixed and I purchased a regular salt mill and dry sea salt."
3,"The flavor is definitely white chocolate. I found it to be too sweet. However, I was able to balance out the sweetness with milk. I used whole milk but I am sure that milk with lesser fat will do the job and save you calories."
3,"I purchased the saffron with an eye to giving it away as presents to three women who are dedicated cooks. Although I myself did not try the product, they have reported that although the saffron did product the lovely yellow color in the dish they had prepared, the flavor was not entirely ""right"".  This is a more affordable version of the more expensive saffron that can be used in a pinch but if you want the total experience, you will have to splurge for the better quality stuff. However, this saffron is still much better than the coloring agents found on supermarket shelves that merely reproduce the desired yellow tinge to dishes."
3,"I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, ""Attention K-Mart shoppers!"" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good."
3,"This coffee is good, it's just a little strong for the strength I usually drink!"
3,"At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."
3,"My local Trader Joe's has a similar product so I was anxious to see how this would stack up.  It is very easy to make and perfect for the health conscious person who desires an alternative to rice or potatoes.<br /><br />I added shrimp to my dish and it was outstanding.  The flavor was very tasty and the product was bold versus getting over cooked.  It is a good base for consumers looking to build a nice entree for your seafood, poultry, pork or even beef.  Of course, for vegetarians you can also build a nice side dish because it is very easy to prepare."
3,"These tend to be a bit chalky/fibery for my taste.  But nod bad if you eat them as something to put lots of meat and low carb sause on.  (I.e a garnish rather then a main meal)"
3,"I bought 21 0z freeze dried liver. Half the container was filled with powder instead of pieces/chunks. I feel I was betrayed by the company. Hence I did not get what I paid for"
3,"I ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children.  Unfortunately, there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the Fall semester.  Update to come when they finally come home for a break -- it may be a while.  The other coffees I have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value, I have no reason to believe this will be any different. I can say that the k cups and the Keurig have been delightful.  I enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that I save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop $2.00 for a cup on the way to work.  Saves all those styrofoam cups too!"
3,"I love the size and convience of these and the fact that it doesn't require refridgeration but the taste is not too great.  The cartons you get in the refridgerated section taste much better.  These little cartons are kind of flat and leave an aftertaste.  It's tolerable but I know it can be better tasting then this so I wouldn't buy these again."
3,"We found this recipe and wanted to try it, this product was only available on Amazon. Fast shipping, product as described"
3,"I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the ""organ"" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!"
3,"This tea is very strong, but doesn't have any delicate flavor that you could enjoy with best and expensive sorts of tea, like indian Darjeeling or chinese Yunnan.<br />You will not find here a fine nuances of taste and aftertaste.<br />PG Tips is very simple. This is a minus.<br /><br />By other hand, PG Tips has a normal flavor of indian BLACK tea, unlike the most others bag's teas smelling by green tea or just by hay.<br />PG Tips is simple, but honest. This is a plus."
3,"I use red lumpfish caviar in a couple of dishes, and this brand is as good as any I've found, though the red coloring is perhaps a little much!"
3,"I like the Senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee. However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew. The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried. In general, I prefer to buy pods from Timothy's World Coffee. The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view. I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid. I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup. If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts, try this blend."
3,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
3,"Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild."
3,"This is just like many breakfast cereals like Honey bunch of oats at the supermarket.<br /><br />This one is in a resealable plastic bag with a ziplock style closure.<br /><br />The taste is good with vanilla flavoring. There were no blueberries but just some tiny blueberry fragments."
3,"I like these in that they are not loaded with sugar, so I save them for my little boy, but the taste is not great. They do last a little longer than regular gumballs. Don't purchase these if you are expecting them to have a great taste, but great for kids I'd say so they are not rotting their mouths with sugar loaded gumballs."
3,"I opened my Big Nut Bar to see what appeared to be a rice krispies treat coated at the bottom with peanut butter.<br /><br />After taking my first bite, I realized that the texture was far chewier then a rice krispies. This wasn't surprising, as dried peanuts are a bit tougher then rice krispies.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that the peanut bar was pretty tasty. However, it was a little to chewy for my taste. This should be avoided by all people who wear dentures, as one bite may take your teeth right off."
3,"the first mouthful i had of these nuts contained a soft rotten one, but since then, haven't run into that. on the plus side, they are cheap; on the minus side, they are not as crisp as i would like, but granted, it is difficult to find crisp brazil nuts."
3,"Being a big clif bar fan, I thought these would be great. However, they were very bland. Thankfully they were not sickeningly sweet like a fruit roll up and the ingredients were healthy. When I think of the taste of these snacks, mediocre is the word that comes to mind.<br /><br />Since this is more something I would get for the kids, I had them taste the snacks. They didn't like them at all and refused to even put them in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />These fruit snacks are healthy, but not tasty."
3,"Ener-g macaroni is cheaper than other GF pastas; unfortunately it also suffers from texture problems that Tinkyada & Glutino have managed to solve.  I found that the macaroni tubes started to split into little noodle fragments even before they had gotten to the ""al dente"" stage.<br />A decent GF pasta solution, although the wheat-eaters in your life may not care for it as much as other brands."
3,"It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner"
3,"Lavazza  is best coffee for espresso. Although this blend is good, the Rossa version is better coffee.  The cost is a bit higher, but since you are saving money making your own espresso, spend the extra pennies."
3,"I really wanted to like this stuff because I need to cut down on coffee consumption. I was very excited to receive this ""coffee."" The minute I opened the bag I noticed it smelled nothing like coffee at all. It was interesting to recall that one of the reviewers stated in a blindfolded taste test you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and real coffee. Hmmmmm. Anyway, I made it exactly like I make my regular coffee, and it tastes nothing like any coffee I have ever tasted anywhere (and I've had my share of desperation java in the past). I was very disappointed in the taste.<br /><br />The flavor is not really ""bad,"" just totally different from that rich coffee aroma and taste. It looks like coffee, though. What I ended up doing is mixing it with regular coffee. This helped a lot, and it reduced my intake of cafffeine and acid. It tasted okay mixed with regular coffee, and that's what I will probably do in the future. Will I buy it again? Probably. If I feel okay and my symptoms improve I will try to stick with it. Like I said, it's not bad, just different. It is possible I will get used to the taste.<br /><br />I did a lot of research on the ingredients in this product. They can be good for your heart and help you feel calm. This could be a good thing. I just wanted to take the time and post about the taste and aroma."
3,"I loved the stage 2 Spinach Mango Pear, although I found it too watery.  I had to add rice to get baby to eat it.  I got the stage 3 mama grain based on the fact that it is suggested for 7 month olds.  My baby is 9 months old and won't eat it.  I disagree that it tastes awful.  I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75."
3,"I am a big fan of gummy bears, but these Haribo Gold Bears are just your average gummies. Black Forest gummy bears are much more flavorful in my opintion. With these Haribos I sometimes can't tell which color I'm eating."
3,"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre."
3,"The dried cherries taste just ok. I thought they had a funny, oily first impression and discovered the ingredient label included sunflower oil and apple juice. Needless to say I was disappointed because the product was advertised as a good deal for those on a natural foods diet. Something doesn't seem natural about adding oil and juice to an already great tasting fruit."
3,"I enjoy this coffee occationally, but the office is split right down the middle between Loving and Disliking it. I think it is worth a try. We order this regularly."
3,"I wanted to like this, really I did.  I like vanilla flavor in my coffee, but this blend leaves an after-taste.  I think I'll go back to the Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and just add French Vanilla Creamer."
3,"All in all, it's not a bad coffee and it's priced well. New England Blueberry coffee does have a good strong blueberry aroma and flavor. However this flavor leaves immediately as it hits the pallet, and it lacks that depth that other brews have. The flavor doesn't last, and the aftertaste isn't that pleasant. I will say that compared to other blueberry coffees I've had, it has a strong blueberry flavor and I do enjoy that. The other pro was that it had no bitterness, which was a pleasant aspect of the coffee. Though, if you are one that enjoys a strong, deep, cup of coffee I would try another brew."
3,"If you are a fan of Slim Jim, buying this package is perfect. Each Slim Jim is packed in a small, snack sized plastic wrap and the price is really great for the 100 Slim Jims this package offers. With that said, this is not the most healthy product...think, sodium, preservatives, fat, and the list goes on...If you are okay with the health factor though, this package is great."
3,"They taste GREAT but the packaging sucks!  I can count on one hand the number of packages that were NOT opened, even a tiny bit.  As I don't eat them every day, I only recently discovered the problem.  The contents the open bags (even the ones with the tiny opening, usually in the bottom) are stale, some more so than others.  If you order an entire box, check EACH bag...."
3,"This tea is much more bitter than other Stash black teas. I brew using the ""moon brew"" method, leaving the bag in the pitcher in the fridge overnight. I use a 4 quart pitcher so it is not an issue of too little water. I recommend brewing for less than 5 hours to ensure less bitterness."
3,"These are tasty enough.  Indeed, if you mix in a tablespoon of raspberry jam or a half-teaspoon of cinnamon, these are QUITE tasty.  But they have no cohesion.  We try to cut them, and they crumble in the pan.  I know gluten-free baked goods tend to be more crumbly than the conventional stuff, but we made Betty Crocker, and they held together just fine.  As tasty as these are, I can't arrange them on a platter and serve them to my friends.  So I'll stick with Betty for a while, but thanks anyway."
3,"I chose this product because of the great reviews but is not as good as I tought, it's just OK."
3,"This is supposed to be ""Sweet & HOT"" beef jerky.  It's sweet, but it's not HOT.  It's not even hot.  If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT."
3,"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!"
3,"I am a 12 - 24 hr adventure racer.  Every race, after 3-4 hours of strenuous activity, I get leg cramps.  I was hoping the EFS would be my ""silver bullet"" to put this issue to rest.  I used it in a 12 hr race.  The label says you can mix it up to double strength if needed and I did.  I still cramped around the 3-4 hour time frame.  Pretty sure my case is on the extreme end of the cramping scale, as the guys I train with don't cramp in the races and we train very similarly."
3,"I love a really bold cup of coffee. I wish StarBuck would make pods.<br />I was disappointed with the Jet Fuel so I ordered the Bold Coffee variety pack.<br />For me the Black Tiger is better.<br />I will be ordering that one from now on."
3,"I was hoping to obtain an energy drink that packed the punch of Red Bull in a more convenient package that didn't need refrigeration.  This wasn't it.  I prefer caffeinated drinks.  The taste, convenient packaging and lower cost (vs 5 hour energy) warranted a 3 star rating (in my opinion.)"
3,"I bought this product. I liked the taste of it very much. I received the package on July 23rd and expiration date is sept 30th. I won;t be able finish all the 6 packs by that time since I bought this for home.<br />Does any one know how to store it for longer time?"
3,"With all the great reviews I guess I set my expectations pretty high<br />It has a very similar taste to prunes with a little more cherry tangy kiss<br />The cherries are not order wholes but shredded to tiny pieces and unidentifiable until tasted. I presume this is for cereal muffins or oatmeal. Makes me wonder if the reviews are from an older target audience... The Prune enjoying type<br />Ordered another box to make sure the dealer didn't cut my cherries with prunes and yep same results"
3,"I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but this product really isn't that bad. There really isn't an after taste and not as intense as I thought it would have been as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The flavor is not amazing, but not bad either. I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the ""natural"" and ""real"" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable)."
3,"This is a nice concept because it is great for taking on-the-go, but I was not a huge fan of the banana taste. If you like bananas you will probably like this though"
3,"i usually love spicy chips... but somehow don't find these appealing... next time i think i will try the plain ones first! these are light and crunchy..."
3,"My fault not theirs, I did a search for raw,organic walnuts and these were the first to come up.  When reading the reviews these were referred to as raw walnuts so I did not do my homework.  Very disappointed that they are not raw so I cancelled my subscribe and save.  Too bad but back to the search."
3,"I just paid $3.00 for the 6 oz tin so watch the pricing....you can still get it for a bit cheaper here but only if you purchase the large multi pack"
3,"This product has a real nice consistency: a lot of firm matter inside, not so much water as in some other alternatives. However, I noticed it's kinda smooth and sweetish, and lo and behold, one of the ingredients is sugar. Wth? Sugar? Why add sugar to a canned tomato product? Not too much, about 1 g per serving more than my usual brand I get locally (according to the label), but you can feel it. I'm not sure why they added sugar, and I don't like it. Sugar aside, this would be five stars (online price is quite good too, although sometimes locally it's on sale and costs even less than here). I'm not sure I'll re-order... I'll continue searching for sugarless alternatives.<br /><br />Added on 02/19/2012: When I posted this, I said the online price was good, well, it surely isn't good now at near two bucks a pop! You can always get this sort of product at about a buck a can, +- a few cents, so use that as a guideline. The prices here jump a lot, so keep that in mind when you read reviews: a price a reviewer mentions may not be the one that's currently displayed here."
3,"I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then."
3,"These cookies taste great!  Thank you for making them.  I was disappointed when they arrived that they had not been packed very well and many if the cookies were crushed in transit."
3,"Ten bags were consumed in eight days. If you are worried about not eating enough vegetables, this product is GOOD.  The taste is great and as a snack or with soup or dip your guests will enjoy this vegetarian product.  There are other Vegetable Chips that contain more nutrients but they are more expensive."
3,"Received this shipment promptly, and it should last a lifetime !! The taste is salty. I think I expected more of a buttery flavor. I think I'd have to use way too much of it in order to get a butter taste, and I don't need that much sodium! Thus, the 3 stars. It is very fine textured, and just right for sprinkling on popcorn, but I plan to try it on baked potatoes, vegetables etc. [after all, I have a case of it]<br /><br />This is the only buttery seasoning I've tried so far in my guest for movie theater tasting popcorn. I don't think I'd recommend buying a case of 12 to anyone, unless you go in with other people and split it a few ways. I did look for this in several grocery stores, and was unable to find it. That's the reason I ordered it as I did. It was only available as a case.<br /><br />Something I have found in ""my movie theater popcorn quest""  is using buttery flavor spray from the dairy section. The one that says I Can't Believe It's Not on the label. It's good to take it out of the fridge a little while before using to let the chill leave it. It's not bad on popcorn and baked potatoes, Irish or sweet."
3,"this product is awesome but the shipping on it is ridiculous.  there are so many other sites which carry this product where there is no shipping.  i love and prefer shopping amazon, but this product is pricey enough where free shipping should be implemented... c'mon get with the rest of the amazon vendors.  at least make it free shipping if you order 3 or more!"
3,"After feeding my recently-acquired cat a case of Wellness Turkey and Salmon without issue, I fully expected her to love the Beef and Salmon as much.  Unfortunately, she loved only the first three cans and won't touch it now without adding some dry food to it.  Hopefully, she will still eat the Turkey and Salmon without any problems."
3,"For the price, it works.  I'm sure kids would love these muffins, but I was a little disappointed that the ""blueberries"" are made in a factory.  Go for the slightly pricier muffin mix with the can of real blueberries."
3,"I live and work in Boulder, Colorado where Izze is headquartered and the product is available almost everywhere here and even sold in the school where I teach. So I've had the chance to try most of the flavors over the last few years. While I appreciate that Izze ""stays true to the fruit"" as their slogan says and is ""refined"" sugar(though it still has 19 grams of sugar per serving) caffeine and preservative free I just don't really care for the taste and would prefer to drink regular fruit juice or water if I'm being virtuous or diet soda if I'm walking on the wild side.  I do especially like pomegranate juice so in trying this flavor I thought maybe I'd finally found the right Izze for me.  Yet the bottom line is I still prefer my juice without ""sparkling"" water.  I should note that the 70% fruit juice content of Izze Pomegranate also includes apple, white grape, cranberry, lemon and pineapple juices and though pomegranate may be the smallest per cent of the juices it definitely is the dominant flavor."
3,"A sample of these Van Houtte ""French Vanilla K-Cups"" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a ""hit-or-miss"" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.<br /><br />When made on the ""Large Cup"" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.<br /><br />CFH"
3,"This tea has a lovely rose bouquet when brewed. No matter what amount of time I steep it, however, the tea has a bitter taste. Too bad the brew doesn't match the smell."
3,"I was thrilled to see the K Cups finally available from Starbucks coffee....bought a few flavors. I can only speak to the French Roast, as it's the only one I've tried so far in K-Cup form, but it's WAAAYYYYYYYY too bitter. I've had it a hundred times from the shop or at home from the ground bag, so maybe it was a ""bad batch"" or maybe it develops something from the K Cup packaging, but it's definitely not the typical French Roast flavor I'm used to. I'll give it 3 stars because I'm so happy they are offering it in K-Cups now, and I'm crossing my fingers the flavor is right with the other varieties I purchased.....for review ONLY on the French Roast K-Cup, I'd have given 1 star only."
3,"My dog loves these, so I'll give them 3 stars, but they seem like a potato-chip consistency, so I'm not thrilled.  I'm switching back to my last brand of these - they were much more of a jerky-like chip.  But hey, my dog is happy..."
3,"Good texture: they are crunchy and not sharp (will not cut mouth)<br /><br />Flavor: They do not taste like potato chips. If I had not just opened the bag I would suspect they were stale. But no this is how they taste. Many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well.<br /><br />Healthy: good for dieting I suppose, low oil, and low salt<br /><br />I will not be buying these again."
3,"Unless it has real, live Pop Rocks that actually explode in your mouth, I'm not interested.  And where are the Fire Stix?"
3,"I am a fairly sophisticated tea drinker and I prefer good Taiwanese green tea (which is 100 times better than tea from China).  This particular k-cup is o.k. but it is more of a Japanese green tea like flavor (darker green).  If you like a good cup of Japanese tea then this is o.k.  I have not found any good k-cup green tea but again even these are much better than Lipton."
3,"Was shorted by one bar.  It was supposed to be a six pack of bars but only five were in the ziplock bag they came in.  Hopeing they correct this problem."
3,"I was a little disappointed with the tea.  The taste of the pumpkin spice that I enjoy so much in Starbucks Pumpkin Spice lattes was sadly not the same."
3,"When this candy arrived the candy inside of the box had been tossed about and were out of the papers for the indivudal pieces.  The packing was very poor and the candy did not taste fresh.  I have eaten Sees candy for years and love it, but this is a great diappointment."
3,"I bought a box of the Gorilla much for the Jimmies rustling properties. I've eaten about half the box and I can't stomach the rest. Tastes like sugar covered grit. There's probably someone who's allergic to gluten where this product is great. Just not for me."
3,"I have been drinking gunpowder green tea for quite a few years, and this tea is perhaps the most bitter that I've had."
3,"starts out good but looses taste and sugar high very quickly. I won't buy it again, I will look for a different company that makes a similar type of gum.."
3,"We've used this cat food for years... LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!  Since I like to order from Amazon, I decided to give this supplier a shot.  I was not paying attention, and it cost me.  I paid the same amount for a 7 lb. bag from this supplier that I would for nearly twice that amount at PetSmart.com.  Next time, I'll stick with PetSmart.  I ended up paying about $1.50 per pound too much.  Good thing my kitties are worth it!"
3,"These have wonderful flavor until it hits the last note. The aftertaste is so poor it ruins the entire drink. As my daughter put it "" I keep drinking it because it is so good but then it tastes so bad."" It has the same bitter aftertaste as drinking a diet soda just a bit stronger."
3,"Each variety is really tart.  I think we would like them better if they were sweeter.  They are good but I'm not sure I would spend the money again."
3,"These granola bars are very similar to the Nature's Valley brand bars.  The Clif Crunch Bars are very messy.  They crumble.  The flavor is not as good as the flavors offered by Nature's Valley."
3,"These jelly beans would probably taste great if you never had a Jelly Belly jelly bean.  They are too sweet and too chewy for my taste.  I am very sorry I strayed from my good ole Jelly Belly's."
3,"Finally, a canned cat food that the kitties are eating (at least for now, with a few vitamins & minerals. And this brand won't end up in the dog bowls! But I am hard pressed to find the chunks of liver - very skimpy - which is really O.K. because the cats leave what few itty bitty pieces that ARE in the can behind (3 Star for deceptive liver chunks/ 5 Star for chicken breast).  Looks almost as pictured, except for liver chunks.  I also bought the plain chicken from same company & will just go with that and rate a 5-STAR.  If your kitties LOVE cooked liver, you won't find enough in this recipe to satisfy their hunger - unless they eat all of the chicken too, which you probably wouldn't buy if cat didn't like chicken.  I am just so happy to transit the dry food & salty canned chicken addicted cat to a wet food to save on the kidneys. I do have one cat that loves raw liver & chicken, but I like to take a day off from adding vitamins and messing with raw meat (cutting, etc) so this is going to work out, it appears; hopefully for awhile - though one never knows with kitties.  Great today - terrible tomorrow!"
3,"These herring fillets have a decent flavor but are not the best.  Their texture is soft and crumbly.  They will do in a pinch but there are better.  They are not too salty which is good.  The size of the can is great, I wish they all came in a 6-7ounce can.  3.5-3.75ounces is not enough for my liking.  I wish Amazon had the ability to let me make a list as to which I think are better than others.I would only buy these if this was all that was available.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5LLC"">Roland Smoked Herring Fillets, 7-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a>"
3,"Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite."
3,"I probably would give one or two extra stars if it were not for my dog.<br /><br />With my friends dogs these treats last from 2 to 4 weeks.  With my dog who has jaws of steel, she can eat these up in under an hour."
3,"I saw this candy advertised on TV and wanted to try it. After I got it I found it at Walgreens. It is good but a little expensive to order online."
3,"Didn't care for this at all. Taste was very sweet (sugar,brown sugar)<br />would like it to have more of a bacon flavor. Boy friends son liked it,used it on hambers."
3,"I am in agreement with several of the users.  I can buy any of these flavors for 4.99 online, at the manufactures website.  Why would I pay 8.99 to 13.99 for the same.  This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste."
3,"I think I received a bad batch of Manon Cafe and Manon Blanc--they were a bit squished and tasted maybe past their prime. Heat wasn't a factor in the shipping process--I ordered these in January in Seattle. Or, maybe these chocolates have a different consistency than the other assortments. In the future, I think I'll stick with their Milk Chocolate or Dark Chocolate assortments."
3,"I liked the flavor of this syrup, but it has much, much more sugar than the regular (non natural) flavors. I think it was like 23g per serviing, but I'm not 100% sure. I will stick to the diet flavors in the future."
3,"I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee.  When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it.  Caramel-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial, e.g. Ghirardelli Chocolate Caramel flavored coffee.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark.  The Caramel Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no caramel odor and has even less caramel taste.  Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging.  In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup.  This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the caramel flavor.  Because the coffee does have a mild caramel tone, it actually has a bit of a burnt taste.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Caramel Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew.  If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box.  You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards."
3,"This Muesli has a generous amount of protein and would be a great wholesome meal for someone on a mass building regimen.<br /><br />On the other hand it also 17g of sugar per serving - a combination of cane sugar and fructose. This makes the cereal really sweet.<br /><br />Its unfortunate that the ingredients label is not available on the website(as of my writing this review) to let buyers know the full contents of the package."
3,"Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-)"
3,"Our cat doesnt care for this one as much as he did the last type of catnip spray we bought. Its really watery and alot of spray comes out using the botttle up quickly."
3,"I love Innova EVO pet food and so do my two cats. Very healthy, great quality food and I was glad to see that Innova EVO's dry cat food line have expanded on their formulas (more variety: e.g. chicken, fish, etc.). My only gripe was that the shipping made this a much more expensive item than if I had purchased it directly from my local downtown pet store!"
3,"My dogs seems to love the flavor of the bones but they don't look to be much bigger than just the regular ""Large"" bones you buy in the store. After Buddy (my dog) brings this one out of his hiding place (he hides all the bones that are easily edible), I'm sure he will devour it immediately."
3,"UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me...well, would a 1 & 1/2 actually, but it really won't let me do that.<br /><br />NEITHER cat ever became fond of this, and we stopped using it completely when I found two 1"" bones and several smaller bone chunks in one of the cans of the ""Snapper"" flavour.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have two cats: Bruegel, a 16 year old female who is very petite and very picky, and Banjo, a 7 year old male who is very large and quite indiscriminate in his choice of what to eat. Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours."
3,"2008 was a reasonably good vintage for organic milk, but spring storms in the northeast damaged some of the milk vines lessening the overall flavor.  Still the bouquet of Organic Valley recalls flavors of dark cherry and oakwood.  I would recommend the 2006 vintage over this year's blend."
3,"I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good. After watching a demonstration on the benefits of purifying the water that comes into my home I can see that drinking from my tap is not an option. However, as much as I like the Essentia water I am not convinced it is so much better than other bottle water that is certainly more affordable."
3,"After Green Mountain decided to discontinue everyone's favorite K-Cup flavor, Expresso, Kenyan AA came the closet as a replacement.  If Green Mountain does not revive the Expresso flavor, I will go back to Melita Columbian brewed in a conventional drip coffee maker."
3,"Sadly, the bad seal problem was almost worth the bold cup of decaf. It would appear that Timothy's decided to put less coffee in to fix the over pressure problem that was breaking seals during brewing. The coffee is still tasty but only if you brew a small, or at most med. cup, and don't add too much cream. In fact, they should drop the Extra Bold designation from this pod because it no longer is. Disappointed.<br /><br />Original review:<br />We have this on Subscribe and save because it is a really good strong cup of decaf. Our latest shipment has had a lot of ruptured seals during brewing. I would say one third to one half. Maybe a bad batch?"
3,"I did not like the taste of this stuff at all.  I tried several cups and just could not get over the taste of cloves or something like that.  Will not try this again."
3,"It is a small basket, well packaged, looks nice. There just isn't a whole lot in there, and what is in there are small amounts (ie big box half full). I have ordered/received other baskets from Wine.com and been very pleased with them. I suppose for under $20 it is not a bad buy/gift."
3,"The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.<br /><br />PK"
3,"You might think that this product, LIBBY'S PUMPKIN PIE MIX, is the same as the pumpkin that Libby produces as their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZYFKQ"">Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin</a>, with maybe spices added.  NOT SO.<br /><br />I don't know what they did, but the nutrient count is different.  The regular pumpkin has 300% of daily requirements for Vitamin A, and 2% of Vitamin C and Calcium.  The Pie Mix has only 90% of Vitamin A; and no measurable Vitamin C.  Calcium remains the same.<br /><br />Other differences are that there are over twice as many Carbs in the Pie Mix, and 2 grams less Fiber and 1 gram less Protein.  Iron is the same in both products.  There is also no Vitamin E in the Pie Mix.<br /><br />In my opinion the Pie Mix is not a bad product, it's just an inferior one.  And while it's not a big deal that I accidentally chose the wrong Libby's product, I don't intend to buy the Pie Mix again, and here's why.  I have a boy who is not a veggie and fruit fan.  He will however eat pie and he likes Pumpkin Pie which is awesome because it can be chock-a-block full of Vitamin A, with a good dose of E and C and Calcium thrown in.  And if I just have one opportunity to fill the Vitamin void, I want to stuff in as much nutrients as possible.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/a sometimes sneaky one at that"
3,"Though the text on the box indicates a superiority to most varieties of flavored green tea, the product does not deliver to either nose or palate. Even ""modest"" FOOJOY Jasmine Green offers more zest and satisfaction."
3,"The only other matcha I have tried is the Teavana Matcha which was great. It went down creamy and smooth and had a nice light flavor without too much bitterness. There is also a savory after taste that lingers on the palate which I liked very much. I've read up from a couple reviews that the Teavana version isn't quite the real deal which was a bit off-putting and got me to thinking- man, how much better does the real matcha taste!? I only ran out of my Teavana Matcha and already I was craving so out of impulsiveness, drove down to my local Whole Foods and bought the Republic of Tea Matcha. Great packaging, had me sold! As for the tea itself? I opened the canister and the product was sealed inside a foiled envelope with a snap seal. I inspected the powder and found it chalky in feel and a darker green color, a sage tint which doesn't seem like authentic matcha. I found that in mixing this powder it dissolves well (I am not using a bamboo whisk to make my matcha [yet!]). The flavor is different, has more bitterness to it, a vegetal taste, with a thin texture- ding, ding ding! NOT MATCHA. I don't have enough experience with other brands but from what I've read of others and from my experience with the Teavana brand, this left me a bit disappointed. I will say that the flavor is not bad at all but has more of a regular green tea taste except much stronger. I will continue to use the product because it does give me that calm yet alert feel that I got from my previous brand so not complaining there. Not bad, not great, it's decent at best. If you are looking for matcha, steer clear of this brand. This is just a powdered green tea in my opinion, not matcha!!"
3,"The title of this item says ""8-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)"". However, in the Product Features description, it says ""Pack of twelve, 10-count boxes each."" The picture of the item shows that there are 10 bars in the box as well. I just received my order, and the boxes only have 8 bars each. I am very disappointed because I thought I would be getting 10 bars. This isn't as good a value - I can get a better deal with coupons in the grocery store."
3,"I consider Purina a reputable brand and my golden retriever really likes Purina Dog Chow, so this seemed like a healthy alternative. My dog ate the food and did end up finishing the bag, but I could tell she didn't love it. After mealtime, she would sometimes leave some of the food in her bowl, which usually doesn't happen. The food doesn't have a strong odor, either good or bad, so maybe that's why it wasn't overly appealing to my dog. I'm sure some dogs would love the food, but it wasn't a favorite for my large dog."
3,"I can't find many brands of decaffeinated coffee pods. Senseo's brand is satisfactory but it is nothing like the decaffeinated coffee I get in restaurants. Folger's brand of decaffeinated coffee pods is a little better than Senseo's."
3,"my 14 week old puppy LOVES the buster cube. I ordered the large one and had NO problem with the instructions and also found the ""difficult setting"" too easy for my shepherd/jindo mix. He WOULD play for hours im sure if i didnt have hardwood floors and consideration for the neighbor below me ... and my own sanity.  Not sure why its made of such hard plastic but its like a car wreck in your home. I can handle about 5 minutes of it and then a have to put it away much to the dismay of my very entertained pup.  This is a great idea but maybe best for people with carpeting or possibly just an 'outside toy'."
3,"Ok this coconut oil smells like alot of butter than coconut oil. I was expecting a fresh coconut oil smell like a tropical island smell this is not it. My mother and my sister do not like the smell at all but coconut oil is suppose to be really good on your body and I would really like to use it but I cant stand the smell. Did I get a bad batch because everyone on here thinks its smells sooooooooooooo good Im not gettting that at all..... is there any other brand?"
3,"I like the texture of the cashews, and the overall flavor is good, but a little too sweet for my taste. I'd like more of the tartness that usually comes with pomegranate."
3,"Hello,<br /> I will not be ordering this again. It wasn't what I had expected it to be. I was kind of like a jam or jelly I guess. It didn't taste bad but it had a lot of stems in it and I didn't enjoy picking them out. If it were not for the stems I would have taken it by spoon 2time a day. I did get the oil that they sell and I just pour it in my juice. It was ok."
3,"As other reviews have mentioned, this pice is ridiculous.  However the product itself is decent.  I purchased this elsewhere because I love the taste of Diet Coke and read some reviews that  tastes just lke Diet Coke.  (My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...  I'm going to siphon some syrup from my parents and try that (if it works, you can get 5 gallon ""bags"" of Diet Coke from SAMs club, makes 35 gallons of soda)"
3,"I bought the GN popcorn popper and the GN portion packs.  The popcorn looks, smells and tastes great!!!  But, there was way too much unpopped corn.  We had an event at the studio and I went through all 24 of the 8oz. packages I bought.  The unpopped kernels equaled over 8 cups!!"
3,"I *love* the Multigrain flavor of these chips/crackers!  I especially love the fact that they're only 80 mg of sodium--so I was totally excited to see--under the nutritional info at Amazon--that the olive and jalapeno flavors were also 80 mg of sodium per serving.  So I ordered all three.  Imagine my total shock and dismay to find out that the olive and jalapeno flavors are truly 210 mg of sodium per serving! Just wanted to warn all future buyers--if you must watch your salt for health reasons--stick to the Multigrain ones!"
3,"Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work."
3,"I thought I had found citric acid powder when I ordered this. It is small crystals. I hope it works for the (rennet) recipes for which it is needed."
3,"This is a great coffee nice and bold and not to bitter and a great cost (with the monthly subscription).<br /> Here is the problem why it doesn't get 5 stars for me. I have had some boxes that the edge of the pod gets sealed in between the two layers of the wrapper making imposable to get the pod out of the wrapper with out tearing the pod and making it useless. I have had as many as 10 out of 18 in a box do this also I have had some boxes that are perfect. I think with a little more quality control Melitta would have a 5 star product here."
3,"If I made my usual morning coffee in my coffee maker (I like it a little on the strong side), added a bit of sweetener and then put it in the refrigerator to cool down for about 24 hours, I would have this drink.  Pretty much exactly this drink.  The first thing I thought of when I took my initial swallow was that it tasted just like cold coffee.  The sweetness was just about where I like it - not too sweet, but not bitter either.  I can see where buying these small, 6.8 fluid oz. cans would be much easier and more convenient than making your own cold, black coffee if you tend to like it cold and take it with you in a hurry.  I'd down about 3 of these every morning if I could afford them.<br /><br />It tastes fine, really does.  I prefer cream with my coffee but I still thought this tasted pretty good - again, just like cold, black, slightly sweetened coffee. I found it smooth and easy to drink. I like ice-coffee and usually make it later in the day from the morning's left-over sitting in the pot. It has 155 mg of caffeine per can so I would assume it could be used as an energy booster for that lag time during the day around 2:00 - 4:00 pm.  The reason for 3 stars is though it tastes just like cold coffee, there is really nothing to distinguish it as something unusually wonderful and unique.<br /><br />And though I did not see it until after I had done it, at the very top of the can it says, ""Do not shake"".  Why, I don't know.  I shook it good and hard before opening. I guess they just want to keep bubbles from forming but I don't think the shaking altered the taste or texture whatsoever."
3,"This is the worst thing to eat for breakfast! I was running late for work one morning and it was down between grabbing a sandwich from Hardees or throwing two of these in the microwave for 10 seconds because that's all the time I had. So anyhow, I opted for the latter. By the time I got to work and got halfway to my first break I had the worst stomach ache. Now, thinking maybe it was something else I didn't attribute that to these poptarts. On a Saturday morning I put two in the toaster and scrambled some egg beaters southwestern eggs with cheese and my stomach did the same thing. These would be nice advertised as dessert primarily but unfortunately these were too sugary for my taste. And on average I like to eat three very thick buttermilk pancakes and drown them in about 1/2 cup syrup and even for me it was too sweet. The flavor is great, however, which is why I kept eating them. If you are buying this for kids they may like it with no side effects but grownups, your stomachs are not iron made like it used to be; maybe the normal pop-tarts will suit your stomach better in the morning. For this reason I gave it a 3.5."
3,"When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this ""puppy goo"".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!"
3,"I make tandoori chicken all of the time so when I saw the price on this premixed seasoning I couldn't resist. When my case of 12 tins arrived I read the label only to discover that the expiration date was one month away. The seasoning is very good, authentic and easier than making from scratch but I won't be able to use a fraction of it before it has lost it's vigor. I've been giving tins to all of my friends and telling them to use it right away."
3,"Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack."
3,"The saffron arrived with a strong chemical odor. It may have been stored close to insecticides. Cooking did not remove the odor. We decided not to use it."
3,"Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates??? ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 2.98 a bag..wow"
3,"I really do not want to review this because I sort of like the taste, at least at first, then there is the after taste.  I do not like to have an aftertaste when I eat or drink anything.<br />The flavor, at first, was very refreshing as long and you keep drinking it.<br />If you are one that is used to diet flavors then you will probably love this. It is a typical diet water, but they say it is natural.  I am not sure but is caffeine natural and sucralose?<br />I would rather just have plain old white sugar at least I know what to expect and it tastes a lot better than this.<br /><br />With all that said the packaging is fine, I like the squirting cap it is like the new ketchup bottles that stand upside down.  So if they could just take away the after taste on this flavored water I would give it a 4 star but for now it only deserves 3.  I am being generous."
3,"I am a bit disappointed.  The flavor was not what I wanted or expected."
3,"The rice arrived in a paper bag and has strange smell even after I washed it. I found the same Basmati rice at Same club was $10 for 15 pounds."
3,"Have to say I was disappointed with this bread. Was suspicious when I saw how fine the mix was. It is usually more nutty. I grew up Ireland and watched my mother make it as a kid. The bread turned out not altogether bad but was a bit too ""sawdusty"" for my liking."
3,"I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt."
3,"I was expecting a really great taste from the reviews I read - not really wonderful at all.  I was odd tasting and not a powerful robust flavor like I had hoped it would be. For the difference in price, I would choose the other flavors before I paid this much for the Mango.  I do like the Blastin' Berry Cherry one. It has that robust flavor, for sure."
3,"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore."""
3,"I bought this after having the fortune of a chance encounter with white truffle oil which I found quite tasty. Also I've had black truffles on french dishes in restaurants of which I also was quite fond. So I looked up various truffle options and decided to give this salt a try. The reviews were lauding this product as being the best thing to the fresh truffle itself .. But alas I was disappointed and really kind of frustrated. Maybe it's 'cause I've had the real thing, but no because the truffle oil is still not an issue. The problem is the strong and distinctive quality of this product which doesn't always enhance but rather changes the flavor of foods I've put it on directly. Unfortunately I haven't always found this change for the better. But it has been OK in soups or stews where the flavor is blended in. Maybe I just got a bad batch or something? I don't know if this sort of thing is like wine where storage conditions can damage it? Anyways I give it 3/5 stars."
3,"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though."
3,"I was hoping the scent of these bags would help keep the dog poop stink down, but the scent fades quickly after you open the bag of eight rolls. What a shame."
3,"Does anyone know the difference between the Raw Cacao Powder that you can buy 2 pouches for $27.00 vs this one for $18.00?  The only packaging difference I've noticed is the bag of the more expensive one is darker.  Perhaps dark chocolate cacao? Both say RAW and organic.  Just wondering."
3,"We are an organic, natural food household. While I like these banana chips -- all of the ingredients (bananas, sugar, coconut oil) are organic, and they use no hydrogenated oil or preservatives -- but they just lack a bit of sweetness that would have made these at least a 4 star snack. Perhaps it is due to the thick cut. We still eat them - I mix them with Good Sense dried pineapple (excellent by the way!) and nuts for a nice trail mix, or sprinkle them into cereal. But we love banana chips, and flavorwise these are OK but just not a home run."
3,"I am constantly searching for a k-cup with a chocolate flavor...this one does not have it.  It smells great but ends up just tasting like plain coffee.  I'll keep searching."
3,"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees."
3,"roduct arrived timely. Six boxes. I sampled this tea in a resturant and it was delicious. Can't say the same for my purchase. Good tea, but not as flavorful as Bigelow."
3,"These were a great price, but nothing to write home about.  Nothing better than Folgers,  I think I'll stick to the beans from Costco, cheap and more flavor-FULL."
3,"I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt."
3,"I find this to be a good product...good spicy flavor and a quick start to an easy meal.  I have since seen this same product, same quantity at my local Costco for a significant amount less. ($10.00 for a case of 12)  I thought that Amazon was supposed to be a good deal????"
3,"You're probably reading the reviews on Amazon about the ""Purina Beneful Original Dog Food"" and wondering, should I or shouldn't I buy this product.<br /><br />And you will have passionate dog owners who will go as far as too cook their dogs meals to spending much more for their dog in order to keep them healthy.  And then you also have dog owners, who can't cook their dogs meals, who can't spend a lot on dog food but just want their dog to be fed but also receiving the vitamins and nutrients that are available.<br /><br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I liken it to my friends.  I have friends who will go to Whole Foods and spend heavily on healthy products, while I have friends who will go the 99 cent store to purchase their spinach or salad or the Grocery Outlet because they are on an extreme budget.<br /><br />The fact is that in this economy, not everyone can spend that much and so, a lot of people look for what is best within their budget.  And the fact is that Purina Beneful products are cheap dollars cheaper than other brands.  It's affordable and when you scan through the ingredients, most will primarily look for the vitamins and just making sure their dog receives the nutrients that they need.<br /><br />I have fed my dogs Beneful before and they love it.  But I know at the same time that dog lovers are adamant to not feed foods with high fat and carbohydrates to your dog.  I use the human comparison that you have friends who can shop at Whole Foods and spend more, while you have the family on the budget purchasing .99 cent pizzas, TV dinners, bacon, rice and spaghetti noodles that are cheaper but yet are not exactly the healthiest.<br /><br />And I have friends who debate on this topic of food they feed themselves and food that they feed their dogs but what it all comes down to is what one is willing to spend or can spend for dog food.<br /><br />There are already a plethora of reviews for those who will tell you this Beneful product is not healthy for your dogs and then you will read those who are on a budget that will tell you that their dogs love it.<br /><br />For my experience alone, I know my dogs love Beneful.  But I don't purchase Beneful all the time.  We have purchased this product in the past to try out but also purchased for what was within our monetary budget at the time.<br /><br />Do I recommend it?  I recommend it based on price for those who are strictly on a budget, not based on ingredients.<br /><br />Purina advertises it as 100% complete and balanced nutrition with wholesome grains and real beef, accented with vitamin-rich vegetables.  For some that may be all that want to know about this product...low price and that their dogs will get a balanced nutrition.  And if that's the case, then go for it!  Otherwise, if you are a person who is hesitant because you want the best food for your dog, then already, you know the answer.  This one is not for you."
3,"The Pamela's Products chocolate cake is heaven.  This vanilla cake is... well, bearable if you have to eat GF food.  Honestly, there are many GF recipes out there to make a sponge cake from scratch that taste way better, so if you don't have to have this product, make your own or buy the chocolate one.  This cake is tough and chalky (and yes, I've made it several times and followed all the instructions). It also has a faintly bitter, salty flavor that gives it an unpleasant aftertaste.  The chocolate cake can pass for a wheat cake with my non-Celiac friends, but this one is easily recognizable as GF. Maybe if it was modified with other ingredients/flavors as other reviewers have commented, then it might taste better.  As a plain white cake, though, it's just not great."
3,"Good enough for pre-popped I guess. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I miss that ""fresh popped"" taste. The ""lite"" moniker should not scare away those that like buttery flavor, though-- this popcorn is actually rather buttered/salted by my standards. Nice that it's organic (must for us), but as mentioned, nothing beats popping your own, though it's nice to not have to deal with the unpopped kernels (I have yet to find any kernels in the 3 bags we've eaten thus far)."
3,"I like this product as well as other nylabone products.  The only problem is when I ordered this product, there was no clear posting of what size dog this product was for.  The only comments I found were ""for powerful chewers.""  I ordered the product and it arrived on time.  It was then that I saw the small print in the lower left hand corner of the packaging stating that it was for dogs up to 50 pounds.  My dog is almost 70 pounds.<br /><br />I notice that they have finally posted the ""for dogs up to 50lbs"" on the description. I only wist they had done this before."
3,"I did the subscribe and save option because my kids ate this all the time in their lunches.  Not many stores around here have the Healthy Request version and it is usually $1.80 somthing.  This is a great savings, not only in the unit price but with the free shipping.  I have noticed though that the noodles seem to be pretty mushy.  I have not purchased any from the store lately so be able to compare but I don't like it myself.  The kids still eat it so I have just reduced the frequency of my shipments without completely cancelling them.  Great idea, okay product."
3,"I like that it's not too bitter, but like a bunch of other reviewers, I find that the coffee comes out a bit too watery.  My cups are 12 ounce.  I use creamer, but it's the powdered kind, not the liquid, so it shouldn't water down the coffee.<br /><br />I will probably not buy these again.  I think I'm going to try the eco filter cups, or whatever they're called, with regular decaf coffee grounds from the grocery store."
3,"This is a great starter kit.  After using the Kcups provided, I decided which flavors I like the best.  So, I do not see myself ordering this bundle more than once a year, as I will be purchasing my favorites."
3,"The flavor is partially saved by the added sugar, but adds more proclivity to get stuck in your teeth. Got these at a steep discount & still wouldn't buy again at that price point."
3,"If you have tried the Starbucks Frappacino - you would have loved it with its rich creamy taste.  Not so much with illy Issimo.<br /><br />Flavor:  As good as Starbucks, Lavazza or any other premium coffee<br /><br />Taste:  Illy has tried to minize on the calories (only 100 cals) - so it is not that great on taste, compare it with the starbucks Frappacino which is made with whole milk and obviously more filling<br /><br />Calories: 100 calories<br /><br />Ingredients:  Unfortunately it contains cellulose which is a factory product, so does starbucks and others, but a premium product like this should have not included this kind of ingredients.<br /><br />Overall - it is low on calories and OK on taste.  Loses a star for the taste, and a star for the ingredients"
3,"This is the first catfood I've had in a can that didn't smell strong of aromas when I opened it, and perhaps that is why the cat wouldn't eat it.  Catfood is notorious for having artificial aromas added to attract finicky cats.  This stuff is all organic and even when hungry, the cat just walked away from it.<br /><br />So the case I bought for the cat literally went to the dogs, who all gave this stuff two paws up.  The dogs saw the small cans as special treats and would woolf it down fast."
3,"This is good beef jerky.  Keep in mind however that you paying almost $15 for 3.75 ounce bag.  Somehow I failed to notice this when I bought it.  I am not quite sure why less than 4 ounces of something costs $8.50 to ship."
3,"To the horror of foodies everywhere, Shake and Bake looks like it's trying to make a comeback. Well, the concept is good, but the flavor just isn't quite there.<br />I do like this cooking method for pork. I grew up in house where pork had to be cooked to death because ""you could get trichinosis."" Well now you don't have to cook pork forever anymore.<br />Anyway, the amount of S&B powder in the packet was not enough to cover 6 thin pork chops. I took two 4-inch diameter, 1-inch thick boneless chops and pounded them to about 1/2 inch thick. Then I cut those in half. The S&B barely covered those four pieces. I cooked it according to directions and then checked them with a meat thermometer. One had to go back in for a few minutes.<br />My results looked very little like the picture on the package. I'm thinking the ""serving suggestion"" photo was one chop with an entire packet of S&B packed on to it and fluffed up for the photo. The powder itself is that color, it doesn't develop it in the oven.<br />We had to liberally douse the meat with ketchup or Japanese tonkatsu sauce. You really do need to serve something with it that has some flavor.<br />SOOO, I won't ever buy it. But I might try making something similar with panko crumbs and some seasonings using their cooking method."
3,"These cookies are pretty average chocolate cookies.  The description of chewy and gooey megafudge doesn't really ring true.  The cookies are soft, and have a pleasant, not-too-sweet taste.  They have kind of an odd texture, almost like an oatmeal cookie.  All in all, I would say they are just ok.  Someone expecting decadent fudge taste will be disappointed."
3,"I found this dish to be a bit bland for my taste buds.<br /><br />The orzo pasta was a nice change of pace than the standard elbow macaroni but I noticed that the small rice-like pasta had a tendency to stick together and form large clumps/masses of pasta.  If I had been better prepared I would have tried to form the masses into balls, breaded them, and fried them to make a version of arancini -- Italian rice balls.  That would have been fun.<br /><br />Anyway, with chicken added to the dish I found it to be okay but, as mentioned, a bit bland and the broccoli in this dish was more for color than flavor.<br /><br />Bump it up with some diced jalapeno and a more flavorful protein and this entree would be much improved."
3,"The item was exactly as described and was received in a timely manner. The only problem was that the 3 items were packed too tight so that one of the containers broke and spilled into the shipping box...The box was sealed so that there was no problem in product quality. Will buy from them again"
3,"We constantly search for the right treats- no arsenic laden rawhides for our girl, but what to give her? At only 15 pounds, she is half beagle, so she fits into a power chewer category. We loved this bag of bully bites, and so does she- she gets to pick one out every nite - it's her bedtime ""chewie"" -- but SOMETIMES we have to counteract it's ""fragrance"" with a little room deodorizer.  Just opening the bag will produce a pretty pungent smell, which of course, the dog loves... it's just a but harsh on human noses....<br />still better than rawhides, 100% protein, no wheat, no corn, no fillers, just little bites of baked bullwinkles... I guess if you're a dog, it would be heavenly...."
3,"I USE MY ESPRESSO MACHINE EVERY DAY, I HAVE THE BLACK CAN VERY GOOD, THE BLUE BRICK VERY GOOD. THIS ONE [RED BRICK} IS GOOD BUT I DON'T GET A GOOD CREMA,NOR DO I FIND IT STRONG ENOUGH. I ALSO USE ALLISSA COFFEE ALSO AVAILABLE FROM AMAZON. I THINK ALISSA IS THE BEST ONE,NEXT THE BLUE BRICK AND BLACK CAN OF LAVAZZA.ALL THESE ESPRESSOS LEAVE A PLEASANT TASTE AND HAVE NO BITTERNESS TO THEM. I DO NOT THINK YOU COULD GO WRONG WITH ANY ONE OF THESE. STEVEN"
3,"Pomegranate is an unusual taste but one that you usually find combined with something else.  However here I found myself wishing it was a different licorice flavor.  It's sweet and tangy...but just one of those tastes that neither wows me or turns me off.  Just an average candy flavor in my book...<br /><br />Reading the package states it is made in mexico which when it comes to food I rather not see...especially on organic labeled items that should have a higher health standard.  Organic here of course just refers to the sugar used.<br /><br />All depends what you're looking for but it isn't something I'd choose again because of where it is made."
3,"I've tried only the caramel, chocolate and hazelnut flavours so far and am disappointed. This is the first and last time that I will buy a sugar=free syrup. I don't usually do sugar-free but I was recently on a diet so I gave in. In any case, I've had regular Torani syrups in the past, and they never failed to please. The sugar-free chocolate was gross. Did not taste like chocolate at all. The caramel smelled very hopeful, but ultimately tasted awful as well. The only one so far that actually tastes like its indicated flavour is the hazelnut. For the time being, I am back to my regular Torani syrups, but perhaps one day soon, I'll brave another sugar-free one..."
3,"I realize these are all organic and that's nice but the are really not that flavorful.  Since I don't buy ginger snaps much during the year I'd rather have the big bang flavors of the popular brands and not care about sugar and organics.  Sorry."
3,"Love Douwe Egbert coffee but found the colombian whole bean is just average, nothing great.  Our favorite is the Aroma Rood."
3,"I tried this because someone said how high quality it is,  well my cats moseyed over to it,  ate a little then sashayed over to the kibble and ate a little.  For 1.70 a can,  it just doesnt ring any bells.  Wish I could buy meat babyfood at less than a dollar a jar somewhere.....but I cant say that my cats liked this better than the 50 cans."
3,"To put it simply, my dog gives up too easy. I bought a package of these thinking it would be easier and less messy than filling the Kong with a food/peanut butter mix and freezing it. Little did I know that my options with these Ziggies were either too easy or too difficult for my dog. If I inserted it into the Kong with just a little bit sticking out she would get the whole thing out very easily and it would be gone in 2-3 minutes. This totally negates the concept of it occupying her over time. Whoever said that a dog won't give up on food until it gets it never met my lab. If I wedged the Ziggie all the way inside the Kong she would give up after trying for 5-10 minutes and walk away from it leaving me to pry it out with a knife. After two tried I ended up feeding the rest of them to her as treats. She enjoyed them very much but the price point is too high to use them in that capacity. Not all dogs are the same and others will probably have more favorable results but I did not."
3,"This tastes like a weak hot chocolate with peppermint in it. It does get a little foamy on top which makes you think it is like a capachino but the flavor isn't strong enough and I really couldn't taste any coffee flavor in it. You need to put more than it calls for to get a strong enough flavor but it still doesn't have a coffee flavor to it. The mint makes it a nice change of pace and really does add to the flavor but this is not something I would buy often, for the price and the extra you need to use, plus the fact that the flavor isn't as good as the real thing it really isn't worth the price and is not what I would consider gourmet or special."
3,"Overall, the ordering process and timing was good.  The cost is much higher than most main stream cat foods but Nature Organics ingredient listing is much superior to others.  My cats didn't dig this Turkey/Chicken so much by itself but when mixed with dry food was gobbled up more enthusiastically."
3,"The cashews used in this product are high quality and delicious like all the nuts sold by Emerald.  The handy green canister has the same functional design as the other snack products from this company I have tried.  But for my taste buds at least the salt and pepper seasoning is way way too strong. Cashews have a delicious flavor that doesn't need any enhancement or at least that's this reviewer's opinion.  I  realize some people will love this flavor (one of my family members who tried them thinks they are great) but the taste just isn't for me."
3,"unless you have heartburn, acid reflux, or mild stomach irritation that is directly attributable to coffee.  I have heartburn and acid reflux, currently treated by OTC acid reducers, and while I've found that certain foods and beverages seem to increase my symptoms, coffee doesn't appear to be one of them, especially since I experience my worst symptoms at night but only drink coffee in the morning (for the caffeine).  (Perhaps this product would make more sense in the decaffeinated version: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JQXB66"">Puroast Low Acid Coffee Natural Decaf Dark French Roast Grind Drip Grind, 0.75-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> or the half decaffeinated version: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JQR7FM"">Puroast Low Acid Coffee Half Caff Dark French Roast Grind Drip Grind, 12 oz Bags (Pack of 2)</a>.)<br /><br />My single 3 oz sample bag (purchasers will receive 10 bags) arrived only partially sealed, a rather surprising lapse in packaging that one hopes is uncommon.  Nevertheless, there remained enough coffee to produce several cups.  Taste and aroma seemed fine to me; in fact I detected no difference from regular gourmet coffees, but for the reasons stated above I also detected no change in my symptoms.<br /><br />In sum I think this a specialized product truly suitable only for noticeably acid symptomatic coffee lovers (you know who you are), and I would encourage them to give it a try and see if it helps (and still tastes worth drinking).  Puroast Low Acid Coffee is available in many different flavors, roasts, and blends, many different bag sizes, and many different grinds plus whole bean; to see what is available just click on the Puroast Low Acid Coffee ""Author"" Button above, or search Amazon using that name."
3,"I appreciate the reviews here and will definitely try it.  However, I will not be buying it from Amazon since the price is ridiculously high.  I found for a lot less over at netrition.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would be more dutiful in including the nutritional information.

3,"SimplYoz.com has crumbles for much less. Violet crumbles are very good. If you don't want to look elsewhere buy them here"
3,"Yes, it has the ""fake sugar"" taste, but it's okay.  The real downside to the product is the price.  In a coffee K-Cup, there is more to it than just coffee grounds in the K-Cup...there is a filter etc, and the brewing occurs in the cup.  With these cider K-cups, it's just ordinary drink mix in the K-Cup.  You're better off just buying the powder at the grocery store, and run the Keurig just for hot water, as you would for tea."
3,"My dog sometimes eats this and sometimes walks away. What can I say...looks good to me, but hes the dog."
3,"The people we gave this basket to over Pesach LOVED it!  But I felt it was a little small for the price.  But the contents were good quality and the presentation was nice."
3,"The Red Rain Zero Calorie Energy Drink is a tiny, 2oz dose of pure energy. It contains caffeine and several vitamins and claims to give you a great energy boost without the sugar crash. With its tiny serving size and pleasing taste, it is easy to gulp down in one swallow. The price is right and very favorable when compared to the 5-Hour Energy Drink. Does it work? Well, I guess. I'm not a regular user of this type of product, so its hard to compare it to others. I did feel a little more pep after taking it. If you are considering it, then buy it because it tastes good and is a good value, but read other reviews to see if it works."
3,"First, I have never tried any other coconut water.  The after taste reminds me of peroxide or baking soda when I had a sore throat.  Does that mean it's old, or is it suppose to have that bland flavor?  It's not terrible, it's just not something I'd choose to quench my thirst.  Hopefully the nutritional quality is there, and in that case, I'd be content."
3,"I can't quite decide whether this is something I'd want to get again. It just seems that for every Van Houtte product I like, there's one that I don't. All I can say for the brand in general is that I recommend getting a sampler pack rather than lots of the individual flavors until you know which ones you do and don't like.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, I can taste the vanilla. It's a little subtle at times, almost to the point where I would've missed if it I wasn't specifically looking for it. This isn't a game killer, as I actually don't like a strong vanilla taste with my vanilla flavored items. Those wanting something more pronounced will probably be disappointed. What I do like about the vanilla is that it doesn't taste artificial (what I can taste, anyway), which makes a big difference when it comes to whether or not I'd choose to drink this if I were to buy a box with this flavor in it.<br /><br />The coffee itself isn't bad. It's neither awful nor extraordinarily good. It's firmly ""in the middle"". I'll say that while I wouldn't avoid this K-Cup in the future, it's not like the Kaluha K-Cups to where I'd purposely go out of my way to purchase it."
3,"I bought this because I was craving dark chocolate, and thought mint sounded great at the time. The chocolate is way too sweet. Dark chocolate is supposed to be a little bitter, not too much, but enough to give it some bite. I guess Ghirardelli decided to cancel that out by adding more sugar. Add to it the super sweet mint filling, and I could barely finish a square it was so sweet. Considering the expense, I expected a much better quality."
3,"This time, the cans came dented.  They sent out replacements, but the new order has the same. This time, I'm sending them back."
3,"I liked the taste of these but they were definitely full of unhealthy fat.  I wish there was a healthier version because I do enjoy the taste of these crackers."
3,"It's not bad.  I had this on my way into work.  Great way to get some caffiene in ya before work!  It only has 4 ingredients: Coffee, sugar, and the other two I assume are preservatives or something.  It tasted almost creamy, although there is no cream in it!  It was sweeter - more sweet than anything else.  The coffee flavor is on the watery side.  It tasted like one of those cold Starbucks drinks you can buy, only not as creamy.  I thought it was good enough - but I'd never buy them.  My preference for a cold coffee-style drink is those excellent Starbucks bottle things!!!"
3,"Don't be dissapointed with the look (brown, like a piece of soggy food). It tastes like a real strawberry."
3,"Should have figured...price was ""too good to be true"" and when I recieved product I saw why....expiration date 20 days away. Not thinking I can drink 96 cups in 20 days...oh well, live and learn."
3,"i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards"
3,"HATE HATE HATE the gooey mess I was just sent from Amazon.  It looked like it melted then firmed up a bit. It was a brown sticky block. Tasted great but it still looked disgusting."
3,"It's great to have agave in a portable format.  But is is difficult to open.  The directions say to pinch to open.  They are not so easy to pinch.  I have found if you bend the tube about 1 inch above the end then pinch the end it helps.  But the agave often gets on your fingers."
3,"Some people are concerned about this product being made in China, personally I think it's fine, since it's from the largest rice cracker manufacturer in the world, they should have decent quality control systems-- after all, the ingredients from the frightening food scandals in China never appears in any of their product that's made in China. (Interestingly, some of their adult rice snacks made in Taiwan were involved).<br /><br />However, I hope I've read the nutrition facts before purchasing this product:it has sugar and sodium. Baby food are not supposed to have sugar and salt added into it. THEY ARE FOR ADULTS! Especially, the sodium per serving for this product is about 2/3 the value for reduce fat potato chips. Since you cannot return grocery purchases on Amazon, think twice before you buy this. My daughter is 8 months old, I'll probably give her this after she's 12 months old -- since I cannot return this anyway, but I won't give her too much in a day simply because of they added salt into this product."
3,"I know that's an odd thing to say, but I was hoping for a thin dark chocolate shell around one of the excellent Mauna Loa macadamia nuts.<br />What I received was a very thick, middle of the road dark chocolate, sometimes wrapped around a half or whole macadamia that was not up to the standards that Mauna Loa usually presents.<br /><br />These are larger than a quarter in diameter.<br /><br />I wont buy them again"
3,"I usually drink Twinnings earl grey.  I opted to try something new and i love bergamont so i figured DOUBLE BERGAMONT would be amazing. Well this tea smells amazing but it is very very weak. I have to use 2 teabags vs 1 twinnings tea bag and seep it for 7+ min in order to get the equal flavor i would get from twinnings. I wish this tea was stronger in flavor not just in smell."
3,"I really enjoy my coffee, but usually do not like flavored coffees.  (I'm actually a bit of a snob with my coffee, getting fresh-roasted beans, using my french press, raising my nose at drip makers...  yet sometimes I do find the convenience of a single-serve Keurig cup irresistible, and not bad at all in a pinch).  The one exception to my ""no flavored coffees"" is SB's Pumpkin Spice Latte.  YUM.  So, I was tempted by this and tried it.<br /><br />It definitely smells better than it tastes.  The smell takes you right back to SB's Latte and sets your expectations high.  The taste, well, not so much.  It's that typical discourse between smell and taste that makes me not like flavored coffee to begin with.<br /><br />But the truth is I will likely come back and have one of these every now and again... it's just not as good as I was hoping.  The fact that a flavored coffee gets any respect from me at all should actually be considered a ""win"", so take that for what it's worth.  If you dig flavored coffee as a rule, I wouldn't be surprised if you loved this.  And even if you aren't usually a flavored coffee person, if you like the P.S. Latte, you may make an exception for this."
3,"but ""Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge"" is TOO MUCH chocolate.  Seriously.  Milk doesn't even help.  In moments of weakness, I have been known to eat a whole package of chocolate chip cookies, with chocolate milk.  I was barely able to eat two of these goo-balls.  On one hand, maybe that's a good thing - it forced me to moderation.  But the truth is, I really didn't like them that much.<br /><br />Oh sure, they are chocolate, and that's really never a bad thing!  But these are just too much for my tastes.  The description is accurate:  they are chewy, they are gooey, they are chocofudge.  Basically, they are the Chips Ahoy chewy chocolate chip cookies, slit open and filled with gooey fudge in the middle.<br /><br />Not bad - just WAY too far over the top for my taste."
3,"This syrup need more flavor-it tasted like regular syrup with some pecan pieces thrown in.  All the pieces of pecan float to the top and fall out on the first serving."
3,"Each tea bag is wrapped in packaging. The bottom of each says ""Best by 20102014"". Huh? I think this tea is stale. The expiration date is confusing or just meaningless.<br />The tea bags are sent in a shipping box. So, you get 100 tea bags all wadded into a cardboard box with a shipping label stuck on the outside. You will need to put the bags into something else when you receive them. A ziplock bag should be fine."
3,"The product is fine but amazon should have packed it better. The case was damaged with three cans opened within the case causing the food to come out all over the other cans...What a mess!...bubble wrap would have helped, they simply put the case in a box with a lot of space and no additional packaging."
3,"I really love sweet things but this peanut butter taste too sweet as a result the peanut taste is not that strong compared to other brands like Smuckers with honey"
3,"I have two cats who are snack-motivated (the third is not, so her vote is not included), and we tried both the Salmon and the Chicken Crunch n Clean. It's a bit on the pricey side, but as anyone who has ever tried to brush their cat's teeth will tell you, anything that can lend a hand in kitty dental hygiene can be worth it. The cats didn't seem to have a preference between Chicken and Salmon, both chased and gobbled the treats immediately. There's the problem, though: whether it's the size or texture of the treats, or just down to the individual cat, only one of the two cats (same size, generally same disposition) bothered to chew. The other just swallowed it whole. I don't mind giving the cats treats, but prefer other brands for their ""junk food"". In this case, only one of them was getting the possibility of a dental benefit."
3,"Great if the dog doesn't get the treat out of the ball when its first inserted...Hard to insert so it amazes me how the dog can achieve the task of getting the treat out of the ball when new...Like the buy three deal and get the fourth free..."
3,"The Tug-A-Jug is a cleverly designed toy that does a good job of entertaining/occupying a dog, but my 85 pound Weimaraner destroyed the largest model inside of a few hours. It's also noisy for indoor use."
3,"I first tasted this tea about 6 months ago, bought it in a grocery store in Philadelphia's Chinatown, 25 bags for about $3.00 as I remember. Very good,similar to Tazo ""China green tips"", but stronger, equal to 2 bags of Tazo. So I ordered 100 bags, very inexpensive, as a gift for a friend in another State this month. Delivery service fine. But the tea tasted awful, brewed with filtered water that was fine. I asked my friends to throw it out.<br />Next time I'm in Chinatown I'll try another 25 bag box. WAS almost as good as the much more expensive Longjing/Lungching teas I've had from ""Teaspring""."
3,"Oatmeal squares (also made with a lot of wheat flour and sugar) are tasty and hold their rather substantial crunch. They also have a nice cinnamon oatmeal flavor with a strong sweet note. So that sounds great, right? Well, they hold their crunch so well that my jaw was tired after chewing through a bowl of them. After a while I felt like I was eating Legos. These hearty pieces are a bit too dense for my taste, so this cereal will not be on my list of favorites."
3,"Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix is convenient and refreshing. One ""stick"" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
3,"I love my coffee and I order my own from a coffee dealer.  I usually grind my own beans for the freshest taste.  I was anxious to try the Melitta Cafe when I saw it was available.  I understand that there are other Melitta blends besides the lighter French style that I received.<br /><br />My reaction to French roast coffee was reaffirmed when I tried this coffee.  That slightly burnt, bitter taste was there and, while it was minimized somewhat, I found myself disappointed.  I had that for my morning coffee and my afternoon coffee and I was going to do the same the next day.  However, I decided that I really didn't want any more of the Melitta so I switched back to the coffee I had been drinking before.  I think that those who like Franch roast coffee will enjoy this product.  As for me, I will pass.  But, hey, what do I know.  I mean, I still have most of the Blue Mountain coffee I bought in Jamaica sitting on the shelf because I didn't it was all that great."
3,"These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part."
3,"I have small dogs and one of these treats is far too large for them.  Plus the one smaller dog doesn't have the jaws to even break through these since they are too hard.  We broke some apart by banging on it with a the end of scissors and they seemed to really like the taste.  But they are too much work to purchase again. I am happy that they seemed to love a low fat treat - but if you have small dogs - you may want to get these instead:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9CH4S"">Old Mother Hubbard Mother's Solutions Snacks for Dogs Soft and Chewy 5 Calorie, 6-Ounce Pouch</a>"
3,"I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!"
3,"There are wide selections of bottled drinking waters available.  This current trend of high pH water claims many ""healthful benefits including being a natural antioxidant, flushes out toxins and neutralizes acidity in the body, more hydrating than conventional water, etc."" from online health and nutrition websites.  Let's give this Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water a try.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Decent taste; similar to my home water filter system with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YOQ0C2"">Watts Premier 531105 RO-Pure Annual Filter Pack</a> that also uses reverse osmosis purification.<br />>I drank the sample 1.5 liter bottle for two evenings during my after-work workouts and didn't notice any improvements in performance but it did quench my thirst very well and seemed to have shortened recovery time with less sore muscles (perhaps from some lactic acid buffering properties AFTER the workouts).<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>I appreciate this sample but the cost of Approx. $5 for each 1.5 liter bottle is very high.  My Ro-Pure system filters the same amount of water for far less.<br />>Healthful benefits are only claims and not proven through scientific studies with proper clinical research methodologies.  It's difficult to draw conclusions by just drinking 1.5 liters.<br />>Possible long term effects of high pH drinking water with ingredients of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride (salts/electrolytes).<br /><br />Overall:<br />Overpriced ""trendy"" drinking water that tastes about the same as home reverse osmosis filtered water.  Claims of high pH water health benefits questionable.  Works OK as regular drinking water but doesn't improve performance during workouts."
3,"I bought this food for my maine coon cat and he must know it is suppose to be good for him. Just like a kid the cat dont care for food that is good for them. It definitely has an odor to it also"
3,"I have felt that Timothy's Columbian Decaf Kcups were worthy of 5 stars, however the last batch (I am on auto delivery) many of the kcups have been defective.  The water does not want to flow through and backs up and makes a mess. I descaled the Keurig, made sure the needle was clear as instructed, ran water through without k cup and worked fine until I put in the K cup. Don't know what the problem is and don't know who to contact about this problem. Using the Keurig is a luxury that I really enjoy but to have throw away this many K cups is beyond annoying as they are rather costly (therein the luxury). I will say that these particular came from the smaller (24ct.) as I ordered those separately from the usual 50 ct. boxes I receive on auto delivery.  I am going to try and contact Timothy's to see what theproblem is. I still will continue to get these K cups unless the problem gets worse."
3,"Picked these up on a whim because I love healthy snacks. I wish they were organic, though. The texture is not what I expected - I was expecting the dense, smooth texture of the more common corn puffs. These are crunchier, and the flavor is very mild. I imagine they would be great for kids, but I won't be picking them up again for the high price."
3,"I love my Keurig and like to switch up the coffees I try. I decided to get this so I would have a nice variety of coffee to choose from. I was excited to see the picture, which includes the Veranda blend. However, when I received it, there was no Veranda blend included. Rather, what I received matched the description later on (3 each of Sumatra, French, Cafe Verona, Pike Place, House, and Breakfast). This is fine, but I would have loved to get some Veranda with it. In all honesty, I should have read the description before buying, but the picture is rather misleading. As far as rating the cups themselves, I don't know yet. I've had Breakfast Blend in the past and it's good, but nothing to write home about. I had the House Blend the other day and did not care for it. It's drinkable, but it's probably my least favorite of the K-cups I've tried thus far. (What I have liked in the past: Caribou-Caribou blend, Caribou-Daybreak Morning blend, Starbucks-Veranda blend)"
3,"My dog wouldn't touch these at first, she would sniff  and walk  away. I ended up making homemade treats that would fit around the bone and sandwiching the home made cookie between the gnawhides. Now she loves them. They are quite expensive though so I don't give them that often.  Good way to keep her busy."
3,"I thought this was going to be finger foods since it said ""training meals""  it is a pure... which my baby will no longer eat"
3,"Slowed my dog down by about 3 seconds.  Now, I think it is actually esier for her to inhale her food since it is in the channel."
3,"Almost to the day, this salad greens garden only lasted 3 months... I thought it would last 6 !!  It was good stuff, healthy, produced good for the first couple of months especially.  I was just sorry to see it end so soon, made the salad greens quite expensive.  We eat a big salad just about every day with dinner.  The greens available at any given time was never enough for us both.  I'd rather see them do away with the mixture and offer the best leafy one for the whole seven holes in the Aerogarden.  The ""spring mix"" and another one (I forget it's name at the moment) did not produce quickly or enough.  I will look for those generic refills so I can make up my own salad greens garden the next time around.  This was just too expensive for what it produced."
3,"I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't like bitter coffee.  This coffee does not brew very strong, and is also bitter.  I've found this to be true of most arabica blends.  The beans have the aroma of vanilla, but the vanilla flavor was very subtle.  I think this coffee would be okay for someone who doesn't like their coffee very strong.  But, if you like a good, strong cup of coffee, I would avoid this one."
3,"I gave the two pieces of antler to a friend's two pitbulls and he said they had devoured them in about two hours. For the price, it was a waste of money. I guess if someone had a smaller dog it would be worth it, but the dogs in my arena are big dogs and bigger chewers and the antlers didn't last half a day. I won't spend money on antlers again. I will try to find someone who goes hunting and will give them to me for free. Nice idea though."
3,"Word of warning: I found these cookies to have a very strong ""chemical"" taste that made them near-inedible.  They weren't as bad as a lot of other prepackaged cookies I've had in the past, but they still had a very strong chemical taste that made them distinctly unappealing. If you're the sort of person who prefers more organic products, I'd stay clear of these."
3,"Pretty good ramen.  If you add either oyster sauce or some fish sauce it'll taste a lot better! Buy some today!"
3,"This item isn't bad, but it has two big problems, it needs a replaceable pad, so one wouldn't have to buy a whole new one every so often, eliminates a lot of waste that way, as with many things. The second problem is that it needs a second rope on the other side, to allow for pulling back and forth (especially on the hard to reach places on the back, nearest the neck, I modified my unit to do this. It is the same with the one made to use with AXE products. Nice idea, but needs more thought through for practical purposes."
3,"I hoped this would be like the muesli I had in Germany a few years ago.  It was mixed with fresh made yogurt and was all I ate for breakfast for the whole month.  I was disappointed because there was such a large quantity of raisins (which I'm not fond of).  However, if you like raisins, these suckers are huge and plump.  The corn flake type things have no crunch and are kind of papery.<br />I was satisfied with the quality of the product for the most part."
3,"Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products."
3,"I really like this popcorn but while the ""best by"" date is 3 months out, all the bags are stale. I now have a whole box of this popcorn that isn't really edible, and I can't return it because it's a ""grocery item-"" as per Amazon's return policy."
3,"It's good if you want no sugar at all.<br /><br />They don't melt and are bitter if you use too much.<br /><br />I acquired its taste now bought the powered version to stretch my money."
3,"We get these all the time and my husband really likes them, however, this last package has been void of strawberries...Was something wrong with a batch that didn't get caught at the factory??"
3,"I have to say, as far as taste its a 5 stare.  Though i was expecting 1 lb of fireballs would be more then what it is."
3,"Maybe I should have picked up on the name ""Jerkee"" but this is not even close to regular jerky. I don't actually mind the label on front that says ""nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed"" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist ""jerkee.""  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky. I used to buy the Wild West brand of jerky here on amazon. It's flavorful and not very sinewey or tough, yet it's real jerky. I'll force myself to finish this stuff and then go back to that or try another brand."
3,"This product was okay; in other words, it was edible. It was very reasonably priced. However, it was very greasy. I don't care for greasy foods. This is the first time I have ever purchased greasy jerky. I think my grandchildren liked it better than I did. They ate it up. However, I won't be purchasing it for personal consumption in the future."
3,"Man!!! I loved the previously available tetra pack ones. For some reason, I am not able to really appreciate the goodness of bottled ZICO which has ADDED FLAVOR now. The tetra packs were really refreshing and tasting real. Being from a south-asia country where freshly chopped coconut water are available, I was really impressed with the tetra packs that was available from ZICO previously. With the added flavor in these, I can feel the artificial flavor when I drink from the bottle now. ZICO has to go back and NOT add the flavor to make it REALLY natural and original. But overall I guess I could give a B+ rating on the product."
3,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good product, but I guess I was expecting something with a more robust edge to it and a stronger flavor. As with their caramel coffee, it's a very subtle taste......you don't get the bold taste that's typical of the Starbuck's bold roast coffee I nortmally like. You also don't get the strong ""flavored coffee"" taste that I like when I buy other flavored coffees (e.g., Maxwell House etc.).<br />That said, if you're looking for a decent coffee that isn't overpowered by the flavoring, this might be a good choice for you"
3,"I made be getting used to the Vaseline brand, which is practically scent-free and leaves your skin highly moisturized. There's nothing particularly wrong with this Dove product (and we used their soaps around the house) but I prefer the scent to be lighter."
3,"I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account."
3,"This tastes just like Wint-O-Green Life Savers. It's a hard, sweet, crunchy ring, with a minty flavor. That pretty much describes it. It's a crunchy mint shaped like a ring."
3,"Love the mushrooms but half the cans arrived badly dented.  Wish they could fix this issue.  I shall miss them as cannot find them in local grocery stores or supermarket."
3,"Since my palate tends to be open to health food, I was not put off by the flavor of these soft orange cranberry bars. The texture however, is very dry. You must eat with a liquid at hand.<br /><br />Flavor analysis: I see the cranberries but do not taste them. I believe it is hidden by the cocoa, brown sugar, and whole grain flours. The orange flavor does seem to come through, albeit lightly. The walnuts flavor is also slightly hidden by the combination of previously mentioned ingredients.<br /><br />Texture: Best described as powdery.<br /><br />Miscellaneous: These could actually do with a little less sweetener. They don't seem as sweet as the oatmeal-raisin version, but  it still is quite sweet.<br /><br />Final Analysis: I can deal with the texture, but if I want a healthy snack, I would prefer that I didn't get that sugar rush feel. They are a decent size and have only 200 calories. That was a nice surprise. Since the cocoa powder dominates, I think it would be better to market these as ""Cocoa Orange Cranberry""."
3,"I know this is supposed to be sweetened and creamy. But drinking a cup of it, I could not shake the idea that I was instead drinking a hot and melted tube of cake icing. Detecting the coffee flavoring which was supposed to allow it to be called 'coffee' was really difficult.<br /><br />Buying it because of the pre-made convenience (and okay the cheap selling price) is self-defeating when the coffee does not taste like coffee. It was next to impossible for me to detect! So, I'd rather pay a little more for halfway deccent coffee, and have to obtain milk and sugar separately.<br /><br />It's certainly not the type of product which you would want to serve in a 'high society' environment hoping to impress your guests about knowledge of coffee. It's international, but the coffee concept is not on par with Italian Cappuccino.<br /><br />But on a plus side, you can drink several cups of this stuff without worrying if it will keep you up at night. It either is decaffeinated. Or the existing caffeine content in the product is so low that it does not affect people with sensitivity."
3,"I am not a huge coffee drinker but my husband is and he likes a strong, bold cup of coffee.  Normally an Italian blend is pretty bold but my husband was not impressed.  I thought it tasted fine but then again I used a good bit of creamer anyway."
3,"I got this garden for Christmas.  My first round of mixed herbs went pretty well.  However, you need to follow the directions for harvesting.  Some of my plants did not look so good after awhile.  Also, something was eating my basil.  Everyday I would find little bite marks on it.  I did get some nice herbs and enjoyed cooking with them at the beginning.  My garden never really looked like the picture.  I think I harvested a little early and took to much off at first. I decided to try again.<br /><br />My next herb kit is in there right now.  Not doing so well.  Little nats or white flys are everywhere.  They must have come with the plants.  There are a ton of them everywhere.  I tried to spray them with an herbal spray but it killed the nats and and injured the plants.  I rinced them all off but they are stuggling.  I'm going to have to start over again!"
3,"I thought this was okay - the chocolate was interesting and not overly sweet.  Granola can be pretty high in fat -- this was moderately so -- definitely not diet food. The idea of chocolate for breakfast doesn't really appeal to me so I would be more inclined to eat this as a snack but as a snack, I would expect it to be in bigger chunks -- this is just going to leave a bunch of small crumbles at the bottom of the bag or a bowl if you serve it as a snack.<br /><br />As for those in our house who do like chocolate for breakfast -- they're not granola eaters so it's hard to know just who the target market for this would be.  It doesn't look like it's anyone in our house."
3,"I love to eat sunflower seeds and in recent years have tried to stay away from the salted variety.  I ordered these seeds for the first time about 4 weeks ago and was disappointed with the taste.  They are not roasted (apparently) and to me taste funky.  The seeds are nice-sized and plump, but I will be tossing them to the pigs tomorrow."
3,"I agree with Terrence Aybar's review (at the time of this posting, it was the top review).<br /><br />This is good stuff -- if we're only focused on nutrition and ingredients -- and its texture makes it a nice 'supplemental' snack in between bottles of milk/formula on the way to eating actual baby food.<br /><br />The packs are very convenient and there's a good amount in each -- the pouch/cap to me is a handy alternative to the jar/lid.<br /><br />The only thing is -- babies don't really seem to be crazy about this flavor. Pears and mixed greens? They got a bit of the tanginess of slightly under-ripe pears mixed with the mineral-y bite of raw greens. I know it's healthy, but it's awfully tart for babies just getting used to transitioning away from sweeter milk or formula.<br /><br />Still, it's a neat product and has its uses... but you might consider trying a different flavor."
3,"Be it mutt or pure-breed, most dog owners are rather picky about what they feed their animals. I know that my mother goes to extremes when feeding her poodle, grinding up fresh veggies and chicken once a day.<br /><br />I don't think she'd buy PURINA's Beneful Origianl Dog Food for him though. Lets look at that ingredient list again; Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, ...beef is the SEVENTH listed ingredient. I'm pretty sure that means it makes up very little of the contents of the 15 lb. bag. PURINA claims the nutrition is 'balanced' and I am sure that in some objective way it is, but dogs are carnivores and a food that is mostly ground yellow corn isn't exactly what I'd call ideal. I'm sure it is as good or better than many generics or store brands, but for the added cost you might as well spend a little more and get a truly [[ASIN:B00139TT72 healthy] dog food.<br /><br />I suppose it is decent mid-range nutrition though. And my mutt seems to like it, though he isn't picky and eats Publix brand dry dog food with about the same gusto. The 15 lb. bag is a good size for a small to mid-sized canine and the re-sealable ""ziplock"" top is handy. I wouldn't get Beneful Original if you are very picky about your pet's nutrition, nor if you are a value oriented dog food buyer. It falls somewhere in-between and I'm not sure it's higher price tag is justified."
3,"This was an impulse buy. I purchased other food items and decided to try getting this from Amazon. I later found that the same product was much cheaper at my local Big Box Membership Warehouse store. The jerky was about the same freshness as I find in local stores. I was hoping for fresher, ie softer jerky."
3,"It seemed like a good idea. Buy in bulk and save some cash, but as it were being shipped it must have warmed up and cooled down. Many of them were stuck together, and colors rubbed off on each other. There was a 2lb mass of beans in the box! Also, beware and don't freak out because the package consists of a cardboard box and jelly beans. No plastic inside the box, no paper lining, nothing. Kind of creepy, but I'm not dead yet, so it must be okay."
3,"I've used this product for almost a year and everything was fine.  All 3 of my dogs seemed to like it, but the last batch had a funny smell and 1 dog isn't crazy about it anymore.  I bought 3 bags last time so hopefully the other bags are ok."
3,"I was really looking forward to sampling this product. It's not bad, but a little too sweet-tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages."
3,"As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up."
3,"I liked the idea of no sweeteners but this gum is extremely hard to chew.  My jaw gets too tired too fast."
3,"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
3,"I  should give this a five star rating because I know the product works.  Ive been cheating for 3 months, and not doing so well.  Im back on track watching my fat intake, and using the benecol chews, Ive gotten my numbers down to 212, but its back up to 245, so Im REALLY GOING TO STICK TO MY BENECOL.  TRY THEM THEY WORK."
3,"I was a little hessatent to order beef jerky from a web site, but I took a chance.  This jerky is true unseasoned beef jerky.  It appears to be hung jerky.  It tastes ok, but not as flavorful as some of the other brands.  This package comes with huge pieces, so it's a little difficult to eat in small portions.  Also, make sure you eat it fast.  It only had a shelf life of 5 days after I opened it beofre it started to mold."
3,"The corny outer shell is nice, and there is a tiny kick of jalapeno in the cheese.  It's not an instant heat burst, though, more like creeper heat.  Typical Combos cheese-food stuffed in the middle.  It's a decent snack, but I'd take a Big Grab of Doritos over these any day.  Thanks to my boss for giving me a 3/4 full partial bag of these.  He was not impressed."
3,"I bought this as a gift to someone I know loves pepper. I hoped this would be a extra special set of peppercorn sample. However, there didn't seem to be anything special about these from my mixed peppercorns that are in a usual multicolored mix. These are just separate from each other. Nothing wrong with them just not worth the extra money"
3,"Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former ""Fresh Mixers"" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to ""Lunch Express,"" apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction."
3,"I was looking for a substitute for the Lily of the Valley products that I had always loved from Norfolk Lavender, since they appear no longer to be producing that scent. On the recommendation of someone reviewing the Caswell-Massey version, I bought a tin of the talc. This stuff doesn't smell at all like the Lily of the Valley that I know and love. It smells more like Easter Lilies or hyacinths. It is blatant and heady, unlike the Norfolk Lavender version, which was light and lovely. When I use up this tin, I will look elsewhere. I certainly won't buy this again, as it comes close to being the heady kind of perfume that gives me headaches. As talc, it is fine, but the scent is not what I wanted in the least."
3,"I love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option doesn't ship at correct times. I just received two shipments at once (even packaged in the same box) this week, when one of those shipments was supposed to be for April and I was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card."
3,"Actually, this granola has freeze-dried strawberries which are quite tasty...but the manufacturer is very stingy with them. I'd guess that an entire bag has the equivalent of one strawberry sliced, diced, and dried. I definitely wanted more! The chocolate chunks are also tasty but sort of few and far between. The granola itself is quite good (albeit a little oatmeal-cookie sweet). But if Love Crunch is going to make chocolate and red berries so prominent on the packaging, they really should make sure that not a mouthful will go by in which you don't get at least a taste of one of those extras. As those components are obviously added after the fact (they're not embedded in the granola itself) they really should be a little more generous."
3,"Daughter loves them but I am disappointed that the first squeeze always looks darker then rest, I even knead it before opening.  I throw away the first squeeze."
3,"they do leave a small stain on the carpet, if you have white anyways.  comes out with damp paper towel, and does have an odor when chewed...."
3,"Maybe I had my expectations set too high after reading the other reviewers. This is nothing like homemade beef broth. Yes, it's better than bullion, and it avoids the ""tinny"" taste that canned broths tend to have. However, it still has a hard-to-describe strange flavor, not the rich beefy taste others described. Plus, it's very very salty. It's hard to make a good sauce or soup from it because of the amount of salt.<br /><br />Each pouch, which reconstitutes to one cup, has 770 mg of sodium. That's higher than most canned broths. I assume that high salt content is to make up for the lack of beef. I don't know how much they use, but the USDA requires less than an ounce of beef for every gallon of water - I don't think they're much higher than that. If you try to concentrate it into a sauce or gravy, it becomes as salty as cheap buffet food.<br /><br />It's not terrible, but it's nothing like the quality of a good boxed chicken broth. I'm certainly not going to reorder it once I run out; I'd rather just avoid recipes that require beef broth."
3,"Unique flavor - read the other reviews!  If you are expecting a ""Sun Chip"" multigraind taste, that's not what you'll find with these crackers - they are unlike any ""multigrain"" item I've ever eaten.  Visible fennel seeds and poppy seeds in them - and the fennel taste is strong.  At first I thought black licorice, even.  Very strong.  Cheese on them helps to cut back on that flavor if you aren't a big fan of it.  Unfortunately, the case I ordered was past the expiration date, which I didn't realize until we'd eaten half of the first box!  So check that when you get them - but Amazon did an amazingly fast refund for me, which I thought was great customer service.  I'd probably try the plain flavor if I bought them again."
3,"not okay for a drip coffee.  this fine grind does not work well in my drip machine and 3 out of 4 bricks arrived compressed and one not.<br />will not buy again but will work for a one time deal."
3,"This lime-flavored drink is good ... in small doses.  None of us could bring ourselves to drink more than half a glass of it.  I definitely think it would be best enjoyed in the summer with LOTS of ice.  This is not a flavor that we will buy again."
3,"I have had to start limiting my intake of caffeine so I thought I would try different brands to see which one tasted the best out of all the ones available. This coffee just ranked adequate in my opinion. The best one I have found so far is Folgers. Of course, preferred coffees are so numerous and people's tastes are so varied it would difficult to rule any one out until they are tasted. IMO, Stewart's decaffeinated is just so-so."
3,"My dog can be a picky eater when it comes to organic/healthy treats and he only eats these about 75% of the time i offer it to him.. i guess it depends on his mood? I actually tried them myself (i try all the treats i buy him before subjecting him to them because i will NOT feed him anything I find disgusting) and they're not too bad - tastes a bit like oatmeal. I do love how you can actually see the pieces of apples and carrots in the treats and I love how the ingredients are certified organic :)<br />btw- the little story on the back of the bag ""Newman Dog Tells All!!"" is hilarious!!"
3,"Not the best pizza sauce you can buy but I'm limited on what I can have shipped and this does come in a non-pull top can. After adding cheese and other toppings it's fine."
3,"As others have mentioned this tea is a good bargain here - also the tea bag option is convenient.<br /><br />I did find this tea lacking in taste, could have been just the batch I received was stale. Found a loose leaf option from Twinings to have much better flavor. It does cost more, but you will also end up getting a lot more tea for your dollar.<br /><br />Overall, if you need the convenience of tea bags, stick with this one, if not, I recommend trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FE"">Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea (Loose Tea)</a>"
3,"As far as snacks go, my family tends to enjoy sweet and to the point when we're on the go.  We don't fall in for messy snacks, or snacks that you need to put together for the 'full effect'.  I got these thinking they'd be good for when we're at the park or beach.<br /><br />For purposes of this review I shared the 5 packs between myself, my sister (18), my cousin (13), my dad (50) and my brother (25) so I could get more than one opinion across age groups.<br /><br />First, I want to point out that these are NOT good for warm/hot days.  I kept my package in an insulated lunchbag in my car for the 15 minutes it took us to drive to the park for the picnic, windows down (save the AC!).  It then sat in the bag for about another 10 minutes until we set up the blanket and all.  It was a gooey mess.  The chocolate drizzling we were all looking forward to became a nightmare as we had to tear open the bags so they lay flat and pick out the popcorn nuggets one at time to avoid being covered in chocolate.<br /><br />Taste wise these were better then the average 'low calorie' snack.  In fact until I told my family they were only 130 calories they had no idea.  The packs didn't scrimp on how much either.  The 1.06 ounce package was easily filled 3/4ths of the way, which is always pleasing.  I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate, but the group consensus was that it tasted good and didn't have a weird after taste some low calorie foods seem to have.<br /><br />Of the five of us my cousin and my brother seemed to enjoy the snack the most, my sister was so-so on it while my dad and I weren't blown away but enjoyed it for what it was.  I think if the treats hadn't melted the way they did we would have enjoyed these a bit more."
3,"This coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor. I am disappointed though because I looked at the bottom and it says decaf. I dunno bout you but I drink coffee for the caffeine. In the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small I did not even consider looking on it. So just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering."
3,"My daughter has a wheat allergy so to satisfy her mac and cheese craving I simply boil some brown rice elbow macaroni and use the cheese package mix out of the Kraft mac and cheese box, discarding the noodles. You can't taste a difference. According to the cheese sauce ingredients supplied by Kraft, the sauce mixture itself does not contain wheat, just the noodles."
3,"The price was right and the other reviews set my expectations of getting something other than Parm so I wasn't disappointed.  The pre-packaged (by Hormel) ready-to-ship case does have a plain white label on the cardboard that says Grilled Chicken Parm, but the meals inside were grilled chicken and pasta.  So it is not the product listed nor the one pictured (which is also different than the one listed).  Tastes fine, about what I expected.  Good value.  All-in-all I'm very happy.<br />Here is what you are really going to get for those who might want to read up on it or see a correct picture:<br />[...]"
3,"It could be that they simply aren't my type of gummi candy but I was not to fond of these.  They were a little rubbery and the cherry flavor was very weak.  I could tell the flavor, but if I hadn't known (and they weren't shaped like cherries) it may have taken me a few tries.  I ended up throwing a fair portion of these away, not because they were gross or anything, but they just weren't good enough to warrant the calorie cost."
3,"The can is well filled with good fillets of eel. The taste is a little bland - the smoked flavour is not very pronounced. Makes a good pate with some onion and capers"
3,"The mail carrier brought the package to my door because of the severe leakage showing through the bubblewrap envelope.  The fragrance was quite strong.  I have severe respiratory issues and I was affected almost immediately causing me to put the package and it's contents in the garage.  It was not an unpleasant fragrance, but not one I can be around, let alone try to use, and for that I am sorry as I wanted to try the product at least once and leave a review of how it was on my very dry scalp.<br /><br />I did open the bottle and saw there was no protective seal.  That should be addressed by the company in future packaging both for leakage issues and for consumer protection.<br /><br />There is no useage information on the bottle except for 1. CLEANSE  2.SMOOTH  3.SOOTHE  4.SEAL  (written exactly like that) on the outside of the peel-up label and on the back it says MASSAGE INTO SCALP AND HAIR.  I think the company can do a little better than that with instructions, especially for a new product on the market.<br /><br />There is an 800 number on the bottle I called twice to talk to customer service to tell them of the packaging as well as my allergic response, but both times I got an MCI operator instead of a Unilever representative. That was rather disconcerting.<br /><br />My personal experience with this product, even without being able to try it, was not a positive one, from the over-powering fragrance to the lack of instructions for use to a non-working phone number."
3,"My baby seems to like it okay. It is grainy but I imagine most powder formulas are.  We have only tried one other Organic formula and it went bad before we were half way through with the canister.  This one I could buy at Target for a fairly reasonable price, seems like I can find it cheaper there than on Amazon. The smell is mild compared to the other brand we tried.  I have no complaints so far."
3,"This is a weird item for me to review, because I didn't like it at all, but my husband liked it a lot. If you want to know what this juice tastes like, put equal parts club soda and orange juice in a glass, stir, and drink. If you like that, you'll like this. If you don't, you won't."
3,"This product arrived on Saturday, April 11, 2009, packed in those daggone styrofoam peanuts!  I HATE dealing with styrofoam peanuts as they go EVERYWHERE!!<br /><br />I've tasted this nectar with herbal teas and was pleasantly surprised!  I'm looking forward to getting more herbal teas and using this nectar with them."
3,"I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!"
3,"The price doubled by the time it was ready to ship the following month.  It's good food.  My cat loves it, and it was a variety pack that I didn't have to worry he wasn't going to eat all of.<br /><br />The price jump was too much for me."
3,"I purchased these pretzels pretty often up until now.  I came back to make another purchase and find the price has gone up.  I will not purchase them unless they return to original price of $19.00."
3,"From a coffee standpoint, I thought this wasn't bad.  If you drink Starbucks coffee regularly, it'll taste just fine.  (For those with more refined tastes, I imagine this won't go over quite as well.)  It's definitely a step up from the Folger's and Maxwell's provided at my work.<br /><br />That said, where's the vanilla?  I could barely taste it!  When I tried using more coffee to increase the flavor, the resulting brew was too bitter.  Milk and sugar did nothing to enhance the vanilla flavor."
3,"I don't like how fruity these bars are. I thought they would be great, you know, having all the different fruit flavors. But once I tasted one, the flavor was a little too strong for me. I could eat one, it's just not my favorite flavor and my number one choice. I like the chocolate, peanut butter and berry flavors and I want to try the peanut-chocolate one too. The bars weren't that bad, just a little too fruity!"
4,"When the labled this product ""extra bold"" they were not lying!  So far, it's the only coffee I've used in my Keurig where I changed the size of the cup so that I had more water.<br />Perfect for Monday morning's or travel mugs!  Daily coffee I prefer something not quite so strong.  My housemate added hot water."
4,"Imagine my suprise when I went to prepare the product (1st time buyer) and there was no spice packette?!  So I needed to open all the remainng to check if theirs were missing. Found another! Even so I would recommend this product.  It's not ""quick"" but the rice turns out fluffy and flavorful. By no means is it spicy. Intend to add my own on the occasion that I would like a little more heat.  As for the boxes sans the spice mixture...I used them in a fresh tomato soup I had made...yummy. Next time will include the spices - it was that good. When the weather warms I'm thinking to transform it into a cold rice salad. So I would definately recommend this product...if you need to be gluten free or not."
4,"We have 3 cats one is a diabetic. This is the only food we have found that is good for him just wish it was not so pricey. But they do not eat alot of it with the old food they ate all the time. also helps with the boxes smell."
4,"Enjoying a cup of coffee or two a day, I was really disappointed when acid- reflux reared its head and coffee was off my list. I enjoy coffee. Alot. I enjoy the whole process, the ritual. I was glad to find this coffee, but really wasn't that hopeful. It turned out to be a nice, smooth, mellow coffee that my stomach tolerates. This is not to say I can drink alot of it, but for a nice hot cup of coffee, it definately does the trick."
4,"Very good product.  Excellent in salads and to cook.  Much lighter and less acidic than vinegar.  My only concern is shelf life."
4,"Takes an extra bottle shake or two to totally dissolve the formula, but we like it and so does our daughter."
4,"I took a chance buying 6 boxes of this cereal, and I was rewarded!  It is flavorful, crispy, and reasonably proced.  The only problem is that one of my six boxes had a hole in the bag.  I discovered tis because  the cereal leaked our through the cracks in the box.  Still a decent value with the lost box."
4,"If you like ginger, you will more than likely appreciate these ginger snaps from Newman's Own Organics.  Unlike many ginger snaps or other ginger-containing products, you not only taste the ginger in these cookies, but you can feel it, too.  Here are the particulars of my review:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*  Real ginger taste - Even after just one cookie, I had that telltale spicy burn in my mouth unique to ginger.  In addition to ground ginger, these cookies contain bits of candied ginger large enough to chew on.  If you really love ginger, you'll probably like these cookies.  For those of you who are sensitive to the spice, these may be too much in my opinion.<br /><br />*  Thick size - While not terribly large, about 1.5 inches across, these are fairly thick - about 1/4 inch.  That makes them thicker than most ginger snaps I've run across and also satisfying to eat.  You don't feel cheated by having just one.<br /><br />*  Ingredients - These are mostly made up of ingredients listed as organic on the label, though not all the ingredients are organic.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*  Palm oil - For those seeking to avoid this particular ingredient, this may be a drawback.  Saturated fat comes in at 1.5g and even though the palm fruit oil is listed as organic, it is the type of fat that may turn some people away.<br /><br />*  Crunch - For this reviewer, these were a little too crunchy - even to the point of being jarring.  I was surprised initially and it reminded me of eating especially hard Corn Nuts or un-popped popcorn.  Maybe it is because they are so thick, or perhaps because they have been baked a little longer.  I could imagine that people with sensitive teeth could have a problem with these.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br /><br />Overall, I think these are good and tasty ginger snaps.  I happen to like ginger, so the strong ginger taste is fine by me.  That ginger spice burns lingers a good 15 minutes after eating these...<br /><br />My main issue with these is how crunchy they are; perhaps I got a batch that got over-cooked, or maybe they will fine tune them as production continues.<br /><br />So if you like ginger and you want to lean towards organics ingredients in your snacks, don't pass these up without giving them a try."
4,"Received the product in plastic wrapping. It is important to keep it under wraps as the salt has the natural tendency to attract moisture esp in places of high humility.<br /><br />Apart from a minor dent on of the edges, it is a nice big piece of salt brick for cooking. There is also an instructions to reminder users to slowly heat up the block to avoid causing it to crack.<br /><br />I am happy with this product."
4,"Switch is a great alternative to soda for those who crave the carbonation of cola or other soda.  It contains no added sugars or corn syrup and purports to be a healthy alternative.<br /><br />I found the black cherry version to be fairly tasty and satisfying.  Why not give it five stars, then?  Several reasons:<br /><br />1. the carbonation overwhelms the black cherry taste<br />2. the 8.3 ounce can is small<br />3. the cost of a 24 pack of these small cans is high.<br /><br />I would like to try other flavors to determine if the carbonation problem is prevalent.  A few are apparently available including grape and orange.<br /><br />This is a good idea that could be great with a few changes."
4,"These bars were delicious. The nuts were great, the honey flavor came through, and the dark chocolate was spot on. The only problem was the texture - I ordered these in the middle of summer & the chocolate had melted & wandered around in the wrapper. I hope to have better results ordering these in winter."
4,"These bars are tasty, with a pleasantly firm texture and a slightly more complex flavor than I've grown accustomed to in mass-produced cereal grain products.  After a few bad experiences with bland, gummy gluten-free bars, I was pleased to discover that these were quite good.  They took the edge of my hunger and gave me the nutrient boost I needed to reach the end of a long, hectic day.<br /><br />But each bar is tiny, about the length of my thumb.  I needed more than half a box to get that nutrient boost, which at these prices is no small cost.  I already know that gluten free food is pricier than unhealthy wheat alternatives, but if one snack costs as much as a fast food dinner, that really pinches my budget.  So it's a tough trade-off between health and economy."
4,"The little crackers are quite tasty and convenient in the little bags. I bought them for my grand kids who tell me they are good. The bags were especially important when my daughter forgot about snack day at preschool and remembered that she had these in the pantry."
4,"GreenDog Naturals is a quality source of highly effective joint maintenance ingredients.  First, they are organic, which is extremely important to me.  I don't want to give my dog products that are grown using pesticides and junk soil filled with manufactured fertilizers.  I appreciate the care that GreenDog Naturals put into this aspect.  Also, I love the ingredients as a whole.  I use most of them myself and as a massage therapist, recommend these same ingredients to my clients.  It has a great Ocean-sourced Omega blend of wild salmon, cod and tuna.  Antioxidants of algae and spirulina with alfalfa  as well as Glucosamine HCI.  There is some cinnamon, clove and flax for digestion and inflammation reduction as well as bromelain and stinging nettle.  Love this stuff.  A tsp. for my 28 lb French Bulldog mixed with his fresh food and he is set to go!  A+ stuff!!"
4,"First, let me say that I can sympathize with the reviewer who gave this a low review because the first time I made these brownies, they were so hard they almost broke the knife when I tried to cut them!  The second time I made them, however, I added an extra egg and also waited a little longer for the melted butter to cool.  They turned out a little more cake-like and were thicker and easier to cut.  These brownies are the best of all the gluten free Betty Crocker mixes I have tried and are comparable in taste (and a little cheaper) to other gluten free brownie mixes I have bought in specialty and health food stores.  In fact, I always had to doctor those mixes a bit by adding extra chocolate chips, but, with this mix it is not necessary.  This mix is easy and quick, which is really nice when a yummy dessert is needed and time is of the essence.  Good job on this one, Betty!<br /><br />I keep experimenting with this mix to make it ""just right.""  My latest experiment worked out the best so far!  I sacrificed my last can of pumpkin for this one! (Pumpkin seems to have disappeared off store shelves this year!)  Use three eggs, 1/3 cup canola oil, and 1/2 cup of ""sacrificial"" pumpkin puree.  Beat together well before adding the mix.  Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees in a 9 X 9 pan sprayed with baking spray.  These turned out really moist, cake-like, and cut easily!"
4,"They were just what I wanted and expected and made perfect curried cashews.  I would buy them again in future"
4,"I won't say it's excellent, but it is very good. The roast is a bit charcoal-y, but it has good body and low acidity. Its smooth and has a bit of fruit. It's good."
4,"I bought the first bag of these at my vet's office.  He's not a big treat fan so I was intrigued with anything he would reccommend. The man actually sugggested I give my dog an ice cube as a treat.  I don't know about your dog, but an ice cube doesn't even appear on my dog's radar scope as a treat. I have a dachshund (pray for me), so he isn't a huge dog...yet.  I cut the treats up into four pieces to get more mileage out of them.  I would've given them 5 stars, but they stink.  I guess the dog wouldn't agree, but my nose tells me differently.  He sure likes them, stinky or not, so I'll be buying them again."
4,"I live in a dorm where I can only cook using a microwave, and I found knorr sides to be perfect for that. This one tastes pretty good, although not the best of the knorr sides. Cooks in only 12 minutes in the microwave."
4,"You really can't beat all the nutritional value you get out of this powder. It's definitely a bit odd to look at; almost like swamp water or something. But the taste is surprisingly acceptable! My advice is to mix it up with some juice and you won't even notice it's in there. Great product."
4,"I think my other review didn't go through because I mentioned a brand-name air popper. Anyway, I am pleased with this popcorn. It works pretty well in an air popper, although a few kernels do want to fly out. But it pops up nice and fluffy. I would buy it again."
4,"Great sausage.  But a little too much garlic for me.  The heat was ok.<br />but the snap and texture still makes it very good sausage.  I also like<br />a more vinegar taste,  but that was easily cured.  I'll  buy  more."
4,"If you're doing a low carb diet or even just want to cut down on them then these are really some of the best low-carb chips you can buy.<br /><br />Taste/Texture: They don't REALLY taste like chips but honestly its close enough to, say, a dorito, that it works. The texture is different, a little lighter than a chip which may be a positive for some people. You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a ""real"" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as ""12 dollars for a pack of 12"" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that. Considering the high price of a lot of speciality products (and this is) it's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Overall: A good purchase for low carb dieters, a tasty chip substitute, something even fans of traditional chips may enjoy. Good value."
4,"I love greenies as a treat for my American Staffy.  She has never gotten sick after eating these treats.  They clean her teeth and keep her breath fresh.  Unfortunately they are very expensive and even at a discounted price, at $1+ per treat, it is quite pricey.  I may look at comporable brands that are less costly, since she eats any type of treat thrown her way.  I am lucky that she is not picky."
4,"This is exactly as I wanted. It is an excellent spice, but 18oz is a huge amount and I bought 2 jugs, which was a mistake. Great to add a unique flavor to rice, soups, and other dishes."
4,"My dog is a fussy eater. The small bites were perfect for her since she's only 6 1/2 pounds. I'd give it 5 stars if she woofed it down. She didn't but that's not unusual. She's picky.  However, if it weren't worth four stars she'd have not eaten it at all. :)"
4,"I have to admit I like the other flavors (Jalapeno and Chipotle) better but this flavor it pretty good too.<br /><br />First off, I am not a TB retail fan at all.  That said, this product is actually pretty tasty.  I use it as a mayonnaise substitute and like the results.  For example, on a turkey and Swiss sandwich, it added a nice taste that complimented the ingredients.<br /><br />Let's face it... This product is not health food but in moderation it has it's place.  Strangely, the only place I din't like it was on a taco - Go figure!"
4,"This cereal is great.  It is very light and fluffy in the container and mixes to a nice smooth consistency.  My daughter enjoys this much more than other brands she has tried.  She opens her mouth and grabs the spoon to help.  She has not had any problems with constipation.  Would have been five stars, but the container is only 2/3 full.  Either provide more cereal in each container or put the cereal into smaller containers.  I want healthy products that are earth friendly, as well."
4,"great snack, with a great price! I would recommend, I enjoy the cliff brand especially this flavor. It is neutral and not overwhelming."
4,"I love this cappuccino for my Keurig!  It is the only product I use with it.  I just wish they would come out with more flavors, like White Chocolate Mocha, or something."
4,"he's all grown up now but not too old to have outgrown his childhood favorite - Nutella. I sent him this five pack and between the good price I caught this at and the Prime/free shipping this is a nice anytime gift to send to someone that is a fan of the flavor."
4,"I love margaritas, but I hate all the calories. Was excited to hear about the new Skinny margarita by Bethenny.  Tried it, and UGH--so disappointing.  If you like really salty tasting drinks, then you will like it, but it didn't taste like a margaria to me, and it was very salty.  Next I tried the skinny cal-o-rita and was so pleasantly surpised!  No salty taste--a little tart, but I had mine with lots of ice, used tequila to mix it with, and it was delicious!  For such a low calorie yummy cocktail, I am hooked.  Am ordering more right now."
4,"Had this oatmeal in Vermont and really liked it.  If you like natural, chewy oatmeal, you will love this.  I use brown sugar for sweetener and I use water instead of milk."
4,"I have tried lots of different bread recipes (GF), you could build a house with most of the results.<br /><br />My first batch of this was a disaster!  Heavy, greasy, I actually threw it away.  Second time around I used extra virgin olive oil, half a cup of rice milk and an extra tsp of egg replacer.  I could not believe it when I looked through the window, I had to move the oven shelf up because the bread had risen 2""!!  If I hadn't have baked the first batch myself I would not believe that it was the same product.<br /><br />I guess it is a good thing I bought a box of 6 because I would definitely not have bothered again.<br /><br />I don't think it is as good as 'proper' bread though, my toddler is allergic to wheat, dairy and eggs, as she is still breastfeeding I have had to give up the good stuff too, hopefully I will be able to manage a bit better with this mix."
4,"I have memories, as a child, of malted milk balls purchased by the ounce from a local candy store, and of how delicious they tasted.<br /><br />As an adult, I have often wondered if my memories are tainted by age and time, since every malted milk ball I've had the pleasure (?) of eating as an adult has only served to remind me of why I don't buy malted milk balls as an adult. We're talking mostly of the stuff sold by Brachs and the like at the drugstore, but also of the many no-names who package up such candy around Easter. They can all be summarized this way: Some malted taste surrounded by waxy brown cr*p that bears a third Cousin twice removed relationship to chocolate.<br /><br />I bought a box (a 10 POUND BOX) of these Jelly Belly malted milk balls on a whim: Amazon had them on a ""cheaper than dirt"" sale. (Well, maybe not quite as cheap as dirt, but close). I wasn't expecting much, and figured if I didn't like them I'd just bring them into work and become the hero of both those with low blood sugar and dentists everywhere, for at least a day.<br /><br />They arrived quickly: Two resealable zip-lock 5lb bags, nicely packaged in an official Jelly Belly box. (Ooh...) So far, so good.<br /><br />About the taste? Oh man, my memories WEREN'T faulty. These are GOOD malted milk balls. These are worth eating. These are worth the calories. Well, perhaps on that last point. But they are truly good. The chocolate tastes like...good chocolate...not brown colored wax. The malted milk crunchy inside is tasty. And there's a LOT of chocolate on each malted milk ball, which is to say, not only do they use good chocolate, but they don't skimp on it, either.<br /><br />If you have ever thought you liked malted milk balls, but have wondered for years why...give these a try."
4,"I haven't eaten cereals in years and normally ate the sugary types like Fruit Loops, Sugar Frosted Flakes, Cap'n Crunch and the like mainly as a dry snack because I'm a sugar fiend and like my cereals sweet.  When I saw this I decided to try it since I haven't binged on cereal in a few years.<br /><br />I really like this cereal a lot because of the nice crunch (corn flakes) and sweet but not too sweet (honey) coating and light peanut taste.  To me the peanut taste is really light but other family members noticed the peanut taste easier than I was able to.  This works out as an excellent dry snack for me but to be thorough I tried it with whole milk and skim milk for the review.<br /><br />It stayed crunchy during the time I ate it with milk and was pleased with the mouthfeel, taste, and texture although I prefer it with whole milk rather than skim.  I believe I'll start buying some of this cereal since I like it a lot as a snack.  I don't eat breakfast so this will always be eaten as a snack by me.<br /><br />If you are a cereal eater I suggest you giving this a try.  I'm pretty sure you'll like this too if you do try it.  This really is a tasty cereal with a nice crunch."
4,"It is delicious.  Just what you'd expect...they picked the very best peppers and aged them longer.  The sauce is a little thicker than the traditional Tabasco.  It really is magnificent, but not at this price.  I'm embarrassed to say that I've consumed $25 worth of hot sauce in a little over two weeks (5 ounces).  I would spend another $25 for a special occasion, or another keep sake/display item for my kitchen, but it's not priced for ongoing consumption.  Perhaps there's a middle ground?  Something a step or two above the original version?  But then again, I'm very happy with the original.  I would surprised to find someone who loved Tabasco more than I do.<br /><br />P.S.  I just realized that you can get the ""undressed"" 5oz bottle (without the wax seal and chain around it) of the reserve for $10 at the tabasco website.  Well worth it.  I wish I had know before I ordered 2 of the wax/chain versions on Amazon (one for consuming and the other for display and consumption years from now)."
4,"I like the texture of these. They are better when cooked stove-top with some seasoning (it is soy afterall) than tossed into a microwave but in a pinch, I do that also. These are a great source of protein for strict vegetarians and those who want to eat more healthy."
4,"First time we have tried stevia so I have no other brands to compare to.  Stevia has a different taste than sugar so you have to get used to that.  In baking with it it did not seem that sweet but I am learning that you have to make your own adjustments.  I love being able to make wholesome cookies & muffins for my children without sugar so I am willing to learn how to use stevia."
4,"I love Italian roast coffee.  While this is not the ""best"" cup of coffee I've ever had it is very good for a Keurig cup.  The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K-cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee."
4,"My dog loves these treats!  I like to split them into 4 pieces to maximize my dog's love.  She'll do anything for these treats."
4,"First off, I must say that my wife absolutely feel in LOVE with this granola. I almost didn't get to have a taste of our first bag before it was gone! She would easily rate it 5 stars, but needless to say I have my own opinion.<br /><br />Being a bit of a chocolate granola snob, I have to compare the flavor and texture of this granola to that of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAMK5O"">KASHI COCOA BEACH GRANOLA</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZ9R3O"">Cascadian Farm Cereal, Dark Chocolate Almond, Organic, 13.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, my long-time favorite. I have enjoyed all three as both a snack and a meal, usually with milk.<br /><br />Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is more enjoyable than the Kashi as both a snack or as a meal. The flavor of the Kashi can be a bit too generic, and this granola just tastes healthier and more natural. As a snack, my only complaint is the amount of small bits that are hard to snack on. Perhaps my wife got all the large morsels before she let me have a taste, but I do feel there should be more uniformity for best enjoyment. This is not as important in a bowl, of course.<br /><br />I enjoyed a medium sized bowl with milk, but this is where the Cascadian Farms granola takes it a step further. I ALWAYS want a second bowl of Cascadian Farms because it just tastes so good, but here I didn't find myself going back for more. While this does lead me to rate this granola just below my personal favorite, it might be a positive point as others trying to lose weight (such as myself) are less likely to give in to the urge for ""just one more bowl""."
4,"Very nice although it lacks the slightly bitter spark of their French Roast. You can see my review of their French Roast which settles the ""is it decaf?"" question. It is not, despite the description on the side of the bag."
4,"As a confirmed chocoholic, I am always on the lookout for something chocolate that might legitimately be eaten as a breakfast food.  When I found Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries, I thought I had reached the end of my quest.<br /><br />The granola portion of this cereal is excellent - it is flavorful and tastes good.  However, the red berries - which appear to be dried strawberries - were lacking in flavor and added little more than some color to the cereal.  I found the tiny chocolate squares to be grainy.<br /><br />This product would be excellent used as a basis for a cheesecake crust or as a layer in a dessert parfait.  It might work well as an addition in basic chocolate chip cookie dough as a substitute for oatmeal and chocolate chips.  It is a granola that allows you to use your imagination andd to enjoy it in multiple forms."
4,"This is a nice, dark, French roast. I usually buy from Coffee Bean Direct, but can't always find people to split 25 pounds so we can get the free shipping. I'm a Dark Sumatra lover so I'm going to see if Cameron's has that too."
4,"Boy, am I so tired of reading reviews bemoaning the ingredients in dog food these days. All the whiners claim that such-and-such is too corm or soy heavy, or that it is not gluten free or some other such crap. Guess what...It's DOG FOOD! For the love of all that is holy would you tools quit your whine-fest and go away! For the record, this product did exactly what it was supposed to do. Do you know what that is? It fed my dogs. Furthermore, they all seemed to enjoy it and have not shown any ill effects or digestive ailments (Not a single degree higher on the dog-fart scale, so I am happy). Sure our dogs are our babies, but the same people who cry about dog food ingredients are the same ones who took the score out of childrens' sports and think everyone is a winner. Total and complete imbeciles.  Beneful Dog Food by Purina will always be welcome in my home. It hits a proper price point that others seem unable to reach.  Our pets are only given a short time with us on this planet, so why not let them enjoy their little lives to the fullest. Give them what they want. If this dog food makes them wag their happy little tails, then have at it. I found this to be a great product and I hope you do to. The naysayers need to get a grip on reality or just raise children instead. They don't deserve dogs! Recommended!"
4,"My family and I travel frequently, and being a retired Chef, I still like to eat well, even on the go! We, my wife, and our twin son and daughter, travel and usually stay in nice ""hotel"" rooms WITH kitchens. So, preparing ""scratch"" sauces on the road is not convenient. With the Knorr Demi Glace, I can cook up a quick light brown gravy, or an elegant light brown sauce easily with this ""instant"" sauce mix. One can use this, to add flavor to everything from Chili, to Stoganoff, and many other dishes.<br /><br />No, it won't replace the freshly scratch made Demi Glace. Nevertheless, it is a great QUICK substitute, and is also easily to convert into several different sauces with other ingredients."
4,"this coffee is really good - my daughter loves it and would rate it very highly too."
4,"I ordered this as a retro-memory-fun times gift for my sister for Christmas.  It was just as we remembered when we were 8."
4,"I love these; a low calorie way to get that ""barbeque potato chip"" taste. Still somewhat high in sodium, but healthier than regular chips. You really do get that barbeque potato chip taste! If you are trying to eat healtier or lose weight this may satisfy your ""potato chip craving"".  I really like the barbeque flavor. Great single serving for portion control. (It's easy to eat too many chips without knowing it!)"
4,"What I like best about this syrup is, it's not obnoxiously sweet. I can use it to flavor seltzer, or as an 'additive' to other drinks (like hot cocoa). When fruity syrups are too sweet, they have almost a slightly bitter taste to them. This doesn't. It's very smooth, but it's not weak either. You don't have to put a ton of syrup in to taste it."
4,"Gave this to my cousin and his wife the past two years.  They were very pleased with the cakes they received (and would send me pics of the cakes as they received them). Liked that we could send it quarterly, rather than monthly.  Just wish there was a little more variety in the cakes.  Nonetheless, great gift for that ""difficult to buy"" person on your list."
4,"Deep River Salt & Vinegar chips are thick and crunchy.  Very tart.  So tart that I can't eat them alone. They are perfect with a sandwich though. These chips are well coated with the seasonings, maybe too much seasonings for some folks tastes.  I suggest buying a small bag before purchasing a large quantity of these.  They aren't for everyone.  Enjoy!"
4,"These organic lollipops are reliable. So I think every mom likes this product.<br />Multiple taste is awesome."
4,"Nice medium coffee blend that has a hint of vanilla and a touch of sweetness.  If you like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HWI700"">Emeril's Vanilla Bean Bam!, Medium Roast Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHJ03I"">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Cappuccino for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, you should like this blend.<br /><br />I drink this as an afternoon or dessert coffee with a splash of milk and a sugar packet.<br /><br />4 Stars because I would like just a touch more vanilla flavor.<br /><br />1/21/11: we ordered another box of this coffee and the vanilla flavor seemed to be a little stronger than our first box."
4,"These are nicely mild, sweet tomatoes. There is a lot of liquid in the can however, and when processed for pizza sauce the resulting consistency was too watery. I'd say you'd need to cook these down quite a bit if you like a thicker sauce.<br /><br />Tasty but not suited to my needs."
4,"Great product. Grape flavor has 200mg caffeine per scoop, which can be excessive if you hit the gym after work and plan on sleeping within few hours. For morning/afternoon workouts, shouldn't be an issue. I took 1/2 scoop with 25 oz water upon entering gym.  I also felt like drinking more water in the gym while drinking this stuff, which is good (and necessary, per instructions). It started kicking in about 20 min into workout. Pretty fast. I didn't want to leave gym today. I felt strong between sets. Effective.<br /><br />Cons: Sweetened with sucralose instead of a natural sweetener, like Stevia. So what if people complain about stevia's strong taste..do you drink this on a night out w/your buddies? No, it's just a pre-workout chug-and-start-training drink!<br /><br />Suggestions: Introduce stevia in place of sucralose. Otherwise, excellent!"
4,"This was a good selection of flavored K-Cup coffees & I recieved a free box of K-Cup hot cocoa with my purchase"
4,"This could be a nice beverage alternate to sodas, but with 33 grams of natural sugar it is worse than a soda pop.  The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.<br /><br />One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories, and, the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados. But, the taste is fairly undefined and could be confused with others, like the cherry which I also got."
4,"My husband love this K-cup, it's a little pricy but a great cup of joe! We went through an 80ct box in a month."
4,"Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough."
4,"Typical of granola snacks, this one packs quite a punch - in terms calories from fat (50 per serving). But it also packs a very generous flavor profile.  The cocoa clearly overpowers any of the almond (barely discernible) or cinnamon (very muted) in the granola - but the natural cocoa as opposed to the corn-syrup laden chocolate 'flavor' used in many brands clearly is a treat.  Paired with chai or even milk, this is a very good occasional snack. The favorite use in this household has been with plain or vanilla Greek yogurt.  Given the unique flavor, natural ingredients used the price/value is reasonable.  But due to the relatively high amount of calories from fat, this is at best an occasional snack paired with fruits/yogurt..."
4,"I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.  We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning ""butter.""  Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush."
4,"I now maintain a bi-monthly subscription to this tea.  The tea comes loose, which is the way I like it for my tea pots. The very best Jasmine pearl green tea sells for $80-$100 a pound.  I enjoy having a genuine jasmine experience  at a more affordable price.  My first order came with individually wrapped servings (about a teaspoon in each plastic package, which you have to cut open to put the loose tea in your cup).  This is no longer the case.  I drink this tea iced (sorry, authentic tea lovers).  It is just healthier and more soothing for me than other drinks.  It is affordable enough to share with friends, who are always amazed.  I wouldn't be without it.  Excellent value for the price."
4,"I'd like to give 3 1/2 stars because they aren't quite up to a 4 star rating but slightly better than 3. They taste good, not sickeningly sweet, about the right size, but they're really rough to the tongue. The first one or two I ate, I noticed my tongue felt numb, and I wondered what caused it. Then I realized it's the roughness as I sucked on them, so I try to remember to let them more or less melt, but quite honestly, it takes a little of the enjoyment out of suckers. Someone else called it grittiness, but I'm just not sure what causes it."
4,"I like this soup.  One of the problems with low fat or healthy is it frequently means an inferior or different taste to the regular, not so healthy stuff.  This soup doesn't suffer that particular problem.  If you like classic to eat, this is a nice substitute."
4,"I liked the popchips, specially the taste and low calorie fact.<br />Also the individial serve bags keeps them fresh and pack just what<br />you need need for a snack."
4,"What can you say about coffee, either you like it or you don't. I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one."
4,"Since we drink a lot of coffee I decided to try this product. I use a bit of cream and sugar or Splenda in my coffee, while my wife uses cream only. She didn't mind that there was some sweetness in this product.<br /><br />PROs:<br />-- Easy to use<br />-- Tastes great and much better than powdered creamer (even Coffe-Mate)<br />-- Just enough sweetness to make my coffee taste good.<br /><br />CONs:<br />-- Container size is too large for casual coffee drinkers<br />-- Pump tends to clog after 1/2 to 2/3rds of a container<br />-- One-way screw top for pump keeps you from rinsing or cleaning clogs<br /><br />I read most of the reviews here before buying this product. Because of info in the reviews, prior to starting use I modified the container top so I could take the pump off, if necessary for cleaning. As it turns out, about half way through the container, the pump started clogging. After cleaning with hot water, the pump worked all the way through to the end of the bottle.<br /><br />I would be more likely to purchase this product regularly if it was available in a smaller size, or if the pump could be removed for cleaning out clogs.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this product and will probably buy it again in the future."
4,"I purchased a air popcorn popper, Presto, which works as it should. I purchased the popcorn, Snappy yellow fourpounds of it and for some reason the product was stale. Snappy arranged to send me a fresh container at their cost....things happen and they fixed the error. Impressed with product and the company...Happy with popcorn!!"
4,"While I dearly love the Cadbury bars from England, I did not have much success with enjoying them, even though they were shipped to me twice.  Shipping candy in the summer months or anywhere where it is hot is difficult.  My first shipment took 10 days and arrived a melted mess in the box.  The second shipment was sent 2 day delivery, arrived 5 days after my order, but was in better shape.  Melted soft but still intact.  In future, I will order these in the colder months and always request 2 day delivery.  Perhaps ordering on Monday will ensure no layover on the weekend.  Amazon did a fine job of packaging, even included a small freezer pad in the container."
4,"Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning."
4,"There are actually two varieties of piloncillo produced-one is lighter (blanco) and one darker (oscuro) If you find this product too weak for your tastes you may wish to seek out the oscuro.This light product is great in flan, sweet potatoes, etc."
4,"My dogs are addicted to these things and it's my fault.  Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air. All I know is that it keeps them quiet and they will do anything for them.<br /><br />I would lower the star ratings based on the fact that the manufacturer knows they have, some what, of a monopoly and charge an inordinate amount for these treats; yet, I am dumb enough to buy them so it's basically my fault.<br /><br />At least by buying on Amazon you are saving some dollar bills as compared to a traditional brick and mortar.<br /><br />My only gripe is that by the time you get to the end of the box, even if you seal the bag, they get significantly harder and I am somewhat concerned that they will splinter.<br /><br />Also, be sure to watch over your dog when he eats them, just to be safe."
4,"Where was this before I turned 21? Oh, popular in Europe. You buy your juice (64 oz. juice with 20+ grams of sugar, filtered, no artificial sweeteners), add a packet (you get 6 packs), attach the included airlock (I used vodka instead of water to prevent insects) and wait at least two days. I waited longer to try to get to the 14% alcohol limit it says it can get. It tastes like a lightly carbonated juice, think champagne. They recommend using grape, cranberry and/or pomegranate. I don't if it would or would not work with orange juice, but it would taste like a mimosa if it did. I would and have recommended this, for the novelty of it alone. It was nice that it came with an airlock, if you want more Amazon sells them, or you can make your own like I did. It really tastes pretty good and it was so easy you couldn't over complicate this/screw up if you tried."
4,"I bought a similar model in the fall and after three uses the motor burned out and the blend function would not work. After that I would have rated this machine a lot lower. So, why the 4 star rating? I contacted the company and they sent me a completely new machine this week! Excellent customer service and now I am back up and running making food for my baby."
4,"not too strong not too weak just right for the morning cup of coffee better than Dunkin Donuts brand and not expensive."
4,"This is not my favorite coffee but I'm still giving it 4-stars.  To me it taste a lot like the Starbucks coffee that hotels and conferences put in those giant coffee pots for the public."
4,"These cookies are especially handy with children because they aren't crumbly like so many gluten free cookies. They have fine flavor, too."
4,"Alright - so these really aren't all that spicy. Yes, they do have a bit of a bite to them, but these slim jim's also pack a lot of flavor. Instead of the mystery meat flavor you get with the standard Slim Jim's - these have a much better balanced flavor of actual ""meat"" and spices. Sure, you can get better snack sticks - but these are truly the king of the slim jim line."
4,"after living in indonesia for over 12 years. I have had kopi luwak more then a few times. Even in indo it is very high priced. I was looking for some here in the US. having just placed my order for this one the review is not really about this one but about the kopi luwak i know.<br /><br />the coffee we used to get is like most indo coffee is more like powder.<br />like a instant coffee.  But is not really instant. put some in a cup and hot water stir and wait a min or to for the nasty stuff to go to the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />There is almost zero of the normal coffee after tatse, The taste to me is more like a nutty & chocolate after taste. Very smooth, and almost<br />Creamy in texture. More then a few of my friends who came to visit me there, said that it was the best coffee they ever had.<br /><br />is it worth the price?  hmm no not really, i have seen it in hotels for over 40 dollars a cup,  but it is fun to get and try with friends at least once, just to say you gave it a shot.<br /><br />maybe if i was rich i would get some more often lol"
4,"This is a really nice value, and a delicious product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too. This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread."
4,"The spicy thai beef jerky makes for a quick high-protein snack between meals. I would give it five stars if there weren't some tough, unchewable pieces in every bag. The tender pieces are very good."
4,"This is great for use in cherry-chocolate martinis.  Like the title of this review says...forget the health stuff; live a little!<br />Cheers!<br /><br />PS Want the recipe?  Let me see some comments."
4,"This is a snack that I can't find in our local markets.  I ordered a case of puffs from amazon.com on a whim.  Shoping for food online was a first for me. When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it.  We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away.  The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.<br /><br />The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste.  However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.  Is that strange or what?<br /><br />I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy.  Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs.  I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs."
4,"For people who know what APO shipping means...<br /><br />The VIA iced coffee is well worth it. I got it in less than a week (for me a record via APO), and works perfectly with the ubiquitous 1-litter water bottle. Everything is in one simple package (includes sugar) just pull the easy rip tab pour into a 1-litter of cold water bottle, shake and perfect coffee every time!<br /><br />My only complaint is you can only buy is boxes of 5 packets, if it came 50 pack i would buy that instead..."
4,"My first batch was a little too flavored, but Red Leaf was glad to replace it, which I am very thankful for. With the right flavoring, it's still not one of my favorites, but that could be previous memories of the taste. Peach blends well with the flavor of matcha, though, so it is a very enjoyable drink overall. Be careful with the temperature of water you use to avoid it becoming bitter, and definitely try it cold with just a touch of sweetener!"
4,"My absolute favorite. So smooth and not bitter at all.  With cream and sugar it tastes like premium coffee ice cream.  I use it in my small drip coffee maker, because I'm usually too busy to make with the espresso maker.  It tastes the same either way, just with less water.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that after drinking it every day for six months I developed heart palpitations. I previously was not a daily coffee drinker, so that probably has something to do with it, but I am only in my early thirties. They don't make a decaf version, and I have yet to find one that tastes as smooth.  So now it's only for special occasions, never days in a row.<br /><br />So if you are sure your heart is VERY healthy (I thought mine was before I had issues), go for it.  But tread lightly, and be sure to keep well hydrated."
4,"Stash has spoiled me for Twinings English Breakfast, which now seems bland by comparison. Stash E.B. has a heartier, more interesting taste."
4,"I really like the fact that is not as sweet as other brands, for some reason still does not taste 100% natural but is close enough."
4,"We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh."
4,"I regularly use instant tea.  I had never seen Lipton Tea as a Diet Instant Tea. I<br />trust the Lipton brand so, I bought this as a case.<br /><br />Lipton Instant Tea is more like tea than some of the other Peach Diet Instant teas<br />I have tried.  The flavor is more subtle, and it is not overly sweet. Of course you<br />can add more mix to enhance the flavor experience. All the others I have tried have<br />tiny pre-measured tubs, that make two-quarts each.<br /><br />This has become my brand of choice for instant diet tea.<br /><br />If you follow the suggested measure, each jar of instant tea is good for 40 servings."
4,"We missed that this coffee is packaged ""For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers."" Doh. We don't have such a brewing device, so I cut open the packets and used the loose, ground beans in our french press (and this worked well).<br /><br />The coffee itself is outstanding (at least via our french press). A nice smooth, rich flavor; a hint of fruit in the smell; very little acid taste. We quite enjoyed it."
4,"The chocolate flavor of it is quite light compared to what I'm used to. However, I haven't been doing the raw thing for too often, so I don't know if that is just a consequence of it being raw and I may not be used to that. I'm going to look around and get some opinions on others, but I will probably come back to this one because the price is great, and it DOES make things chocolatey. . . just not like I'm used to."
4,"My dogs were destroying my wooden fence when agitating back and forth the neighbor's dogs.  Installed this to keep them off of the fence and the problem was solved."
4,"Funny thing - I bought some of these K-cups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time.  I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth.<br /><br />They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known - I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.<br /><br />I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.  You'll sacrifice a little for the convenience, but to me it's well worth it."
4,"This milk is almost as good as Sanalac Dry Milk.  It is just a very little bit thinner and not quite as sweet tasting as Sanalac Dry Milk.  As I am having trouble finding Sanalac Milk, this is definitely a reasonable substitute.  [...]"
4,"Excellent papers. Very thin but strong. Imparts no flavor on the ""tobacco"". Water marks are a sexy ""X"" pattern. It is an insane amount of papers for the money too. I ended up giving some of them out to friends. I stopped smoking ""tobacco"" recently(gotta go to college and get a job), so I don't use them anymore, but I think of them fondly. Only downside is they don't handle the weight of the ""tobacco"" well."
4,"some days I like to think of myself as a coffee snob, but in reality I want a bag of coffee that is reasonably-priced and prime eligible. This met expectations and works well in our espresso machine. Feels weird that they write the word ORGANIC bigger than the actual roast type, but I guess they know their audience."
4,"My cat is a very finicky eater, and so finding a good quality food that he likes was challenging.  Wellness turkey is literally the ONLY wet food he will eat!  He has been on it for about 4 years now.  In comparison to other wet foods out there (besides making it fresh at home) I doubt you'll find better quality in ingredients, and low ash content, which all of us cat parents know is important for urinary health. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price.  It is a more expensive food and I do wish they would lower the price a little.  I will continue to buy this from Amazon since it saves me a few dollars versus buying it here in town.  Regardless of price, I would never switch to a cheaper food with cheaper ingredients that would threaten the health and well being of my cat and probably just cost me more money in the long run in vet bills.  So really you can justify the cost of this food and once again you can't beat the quality!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  CAT APPROVED!"
4,"these gummi bears was a healthy way that my child could something not full of sugar and they tasted no different than the ones with sugar"
4,"So, this is pretty much the least expensive way to get Big Red on Amazon, and I have no problems with the product. It is Big Red (yum) and it arrives in less than 5 days. My only gripe is that each time I have ordered (two times total), 1-2 of my cans are crushed. It could probably use a little more padding for shipping to protect it."
4,"I am not a tea snob.  I enjoy a ""snobby"" cup of tea, well made in a tea shop but at home, I like the convenience of a tea bag.  Twinings brand English Breakfast is one of my favorite blends so that is my comparison tea.<br /><br />I made this tea with 6 oz. (3/4 Cup) of boiling water poured over the tea bag.  If you use more than 6 oz., your tea will be weak; these premeasured bags are not meant to steep a big US mug of water. If you are using a big mug, use 2 tea bags. I steep for 3 minutes so that the tea doesn't become ""stewed""; that funky, bitter taste.  You should use the water immediately after reaching the boiling point because oxygen will evaporate the longer the water boils & your tea will taste flat.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke is a nice cup of tea.  It has a strong, not bitter flavor with a little maltiness & a hint of smoke.  I think the Twinings is a little more refined, more malty & no smoke.  I like my English Breakfast tea with just a splash of cream; no sugar.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke is a blend of Assam & Ceylon teas.  The Twinings is a blend of Assam & Kenyan.  If you like a bit more brash black tea, you may like the Higgins & Burke."
4,"can't get these at our local grocery so we order them all the time, they're easy and great and taste the same after having been frozen."
4,"I have now tried all the miracle noodles and have found these to be best. The consistency is closer to a chewy rice noodle, which I like and they are great with saut&eacute;ed veggies! The angle-hair is also good, but the rice is really gross consistency. I cant say I dont miss traditional noodles still but these are fabulous to cut those carbs and still fill a bowl with more than just vegetables."
4,"This is a great loose leaf tea.  A very fresh taste for the first cup of the morning."
4,"My mom used to heat this up and pour it over toast for an after school snack in the 70's. It's still just as good except better because they took out the trans fats. I wouldn't eat it too often though because it is kinda high fat and sodium, but once in awhile shouldn't hurt."
4,"I loved the flavor of this tea.  I don't know if it was helpful for dieting, but the flavor is really appealing.  I was disappointed to find that it's not recommended for nursing mothers, so I had to wait a while to drink it."
4,"Before I bought this from Amazon, I looked at Elmwood Inn's website and noticed a disparity between their prices and Amazon's.  On Amazon, the price is much lower.  I surmised this was old tea Elmwood Inn had overstocked.<br /><br />I think I was right.  The pouch is as airtight and sturdy as any I've seen.  But the tea leaves are a mixture of color, mostly a nice jade, but with some brown leaves, and some leaves beginning to turn white.  This must be a second or third flush.  The leaves that remained intact are quite large.  Most of the leaves are broken, but they are not fannings or dust.  Tea leaves are fragile and break during shipment.  The leaves are well-prepared - very thin and flat, as dragonwell should be.<br /><br />While steeping, it gives an asparagus-y vegetal aroma.  The taste is vegetal with a slight hint of nuttiness and a clean, astringent finish.  This is not the best dragonwell or lung ching I've ever tasted, but for an everyday dragonwell, it will certainly do.  If you want dragonwell at a bargain price and are willing to sacrifice some quality, this is an excellent deal.  If you want an excellent dragonwell, get a very expensive one directly from a good tea merchant."
4,"My dog loves them. She comes runniong as soon as she hears me touch the bag.  But, since my dog is small (15lbs), most of the time I cut them in half before giving them to her."
4,"I received these to give my unbiased opinion.  I liked the amount of crunchiness and the flavor of the nuttiness of the crackers,but they were a bit too salty for my taste.<br />Overall they were very filling and easy enough to transport and eat on the go."
4,"I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?"
4,"I read a review that said some will have almost no flavor and some will have a lot. This hit the nail on the head. Grab a handful and eat them one at a time. Some are bland like a Cheerio and some are almost sour, like jarred banana baby food is. That being said, flavor is not much of an issue. I don't see parents lining up to eat their kid's pureed peas. It's about what is better. I really don't like ANY food going into my baby's system that has a paragraph long list of ingredients that sound more like a science experiment with a recipe, but I feel better about these puffs than the Gerber ones. Also, I bought this at Target instead of from Amazon."
4,"I was so ecstatic when I purchased two 44lb bags of canidae dog food.  We have used this food for years and my dogs love it. They have  beautiful coats. On  August 15, 2011 for 41.99 each with free shipping from amazon. The actual shipper was Petcare RX. Since I am feeding 4 large dogs (including a rescue) we go through a lot of food. Its nice to have it delivered to your door. I just signed on to reorder and noticed that amazon increased the price from $41.99 to $55. In theory, there goes free shipping. They rolled it into the new cost of the food. Now, it is no cheaper for me to purchase it on amazon since my neighborhood pet store sells it for $54.00 and I don't have to order it 7-10 days ahead just to make sure I get it before our current supply runs out. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!"
4,"My husband, who is a two-cup-a-day coffee drinker, really likes this flavor. I highly recommend to those who enjoy flavored coffee."
4,"My dogs love these treats!! Would have given 5 stars but they are very small. My 80 and 100 pound Labradors wolf these. Wish they came in a larger bite size."
4,"Well, I was envious when I gave this my dog.  It really does smell good and he loves it."
4,"I just bought a six-pack of Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa mix.  It's pretty good for the price.  My favorite will always be Ghirardelli -- but this does the trick in a pinch."
4,"These bottles have saved me from the insanity of constant sleepless nights with a colicky baby.<br />My older son never had this issue so I used Avent bottles with him, with my second we had a differnt story.<br /><br />These bottles helped with his colic within a day, he was spitting up much less, he slept soundly in between feeds. And of course, the angle reduced air intake so he wasnt as cranky.<br /><br />I was glad these dont have many parts, like most anti colic bottles, the nipple is a size which most babies can easily adapt to, and the comfy grip gives a good hold.<br /><br />Plus these arent as expensive as most bottles on the market.<br /><br />The only downside is that they arent wide at the neck, so getting formula in takes patience, but otherwise no issues!"
4,"I really enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I often have it in China town and Flushing, where it is refereed to as Nai Cha (milk tea).<br /><br />Its very good with cream and sugar, and is one of my favorite treats."
4,"Like the product, but the size keeps decreasing with the price also rising at the same time.  Amazon still has the best price by far and I will never buy this product in a local store again."
4,"These Pods are great.  They provide excellent tasting espresso without the grinding process which saves a lot of time.  The only downside is each pod only provides 1oz of espresso.  So if you're going to make two double shots of espresso that's 4 pods you would have to change in and out which makes a lot work.  Overall great for just yourself but if making more than a shot or two for yourself, you'd be better off going with beans or grounds."
4,"Easy to heat and eat. Expensive but convenient and healthy.  A good, tasty and meatless meal that is nutrious for you!"
4,"I was happily surprised when the package arrived 2 days after I placed the order. The K-cups were in a brown paper bag inside of a box no cups were damaged, all were in date! The variety was good with NO duplicates and it's an inexpensive way to try different flavors. The only down side was my daughter was really wanting a cider as the description promised but there weren't any. We aren't hot tea drinkers and luckily there were only 5 teas. I would order again without any hesitation!"
4,"If you are looking for a really good snack with relatively few calories, this is the one for you.  Tastes good, is relatively good for you when compared with other potato chip snacks and ordering them from Amazon makes them easy to keep on hand."
4,"These were really tasty, some might even say habit forming. The only thing is that they are a little expensive. My family loved them so I'll likely purchase them again."
4,"This hot drink is fabulous!  It's rich and creamy (made with skim or low-fat milk rather than water), and just makes me feel good when I drink it.  This is my favorite flavor of them all, although they're all pretty good.  General Foods International came out with a new one, Mocha Latte, which is very good too.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because it contains trans fat.  Even though the nutritional label says 0% trans fat, the ingredients has partially hydrogenated listed within the non-dairy creamer ingredient.  I imagine it's negligible, but it can add up.  Otherwise, this would be a 5 star product for sure!"
4,"I really enjoy this tea.  I find when the weather starts to get cooler I prefer warm drinks and to much coffee is not a good thing.  I bought this tea so that I would have something other than coffee at work.  I have read about all of the wonder health benefits that are supposed to come from tea but green tea tends to make me nauseated for some reason.  This tea has a wonderful mild flavor and with a few drops of lemon drop stevia is a great treat.  I have one complaint though, my box had several broken bags and I would have to roll it up and staple it closed before I could use it."
4,"The package arrived a full day early which was great.  The plant itself took about three weeks for it to start growing so be patient.  The only slightly negative thing about it is the can they give you to grown in is very small, other than that everything was great."
4,"This is delicious hot chocolate. It is best at 8 oz cup, but can be stretched to 10. And 8oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha"
4,"I never made salad dressing at home before, so I tried to make honey mustard using the recipe on the side of the bottle. Yikes! it came out far too intense. I tweaked it a little and found the result pleasing enough, though it does not blow me away. Thinking that the herb mix would work well for marinades or rubs, I marinated some chicken in the too-strong dressing I had made, and it came out delicious. I like the fact that is is all natural, think it is useful and convenient, but based on my own personal tastes I'm not sure I would enthusiastically recommend it to my friends."
4,"If my two cats were to write this review, they's give Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie and Chinese Chicken eight paws up.  They like it; I assume that they like the flavor and consistency.  And the liquid isn't 'water,' it's broth and the first part that my guys eat.  I like that it's 'kitty healthy,' but the cost is a bit steep."
4,"I love this pulp -- it is inexpensive and delicious and an easy way to get fruit into the kids' diets.  My only concern is that it has added sugar and overall is quite high in sugar, but since I mix it with plain lowfat yogurt and milk for lassis, I believe the whole is pretty healthful."
4,"The ""mellow mut"" chicken breast strips are great for my dog - he loves them and they aren't full of artificial junk. They make a good snack mid-morning for him when starts bugging me for food. Only one drawback: some of the strips are not consistent in size and this creates a problem for a little chihuahua mouth with few teeth; some of the strips are so thick he can't bite through them. I give them to the neighbor's big dog, which makes the cost of the ones we keep very expensive!"
4,"I picked Sahale cashews with pomegranate at a Starbuck's after coming from the gym. They are so tasty, not too sweet but sweet enough. I was delighted to be able to order them on Amazon. They are a bit pricey, but come out cheaper when you buy them in bulk vs. buying single packets in local stores. I will buy them again."
4,"I enjoy the sugar-free coconut syrup and am unable to find it in my area.  However, once ordered, I was unhappy with my purchase from Amazon.  It cost me ~30% more than if I had purchased it from Lollicup...and when it was delivered, it was actually delivered in a Lollicup box!  Though I have appreciated ordering books from this, this Torani experience will make me think twice about ordering food items directly from Amazon.com."
4,"It came very fast and none of the leaves are falling off but they look pale. I repotted them and watered them and put it under a lamp so hopefully evrything will do well. I'll update later on..."
4,"Pomegranate is one of my new favorite flavors.  I like pomegranate juice, tea and now licorice. Newman's Own has made a great tasting treat.  It's a lightly sweetened licorice twist, made with all natural, organic ingredients.  It has only a trace of fat and is low in sodium and sugar.  That I definitely like.  When I first tasted it, I thought it was more of a cherry/pomegranate blend.  And after reading the ingredient list, I realized why.  Besides pomegranate it has Elderberry extract.  If you like licorice, I do recommend giving this one a try."
4,"Normally, I cannot stand the taste of cocnut milk or water. This coconut water was suggested to me by friends who use it as a recovery drink after exercise. Much to my surprise, this tastes great. It is thirst quenching, refreshing, and makes me feel reinvigorated after a hard workout. I highly recommend this coconut water over most recovery style beverages or for thirst quenching in general."
4,"Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee was the first Larabar that I've ordered. Before the bars arrived at my doorstep, I was expecting a typical fruit-n-nut type of food bar that contains whole pieces of chunky nuts. So I was a little disappointed when I opened one and saw that the nuts were broken into tiny pieces instead. The bar was also shorter than I'd imagined.<br /><br />But the good thing is, the taste didn't disappoint. All the bars were not dry and hard, but instead they were moist and firm even when they were kept in the refrigerator. It would be a different texture if huge chunky nuts are used. Those who found them hard and dry probably got bars that were too close to their sell-by date. My bars had a good 10 months to go before expiring.<br /><br />What I like most is the fact that Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee (and later I found out it applies to other flavors of Larabar as well) these bars were not sickening sweet like other energy bars I've tasted. It's quite sad to taste a food bar prepared with good ingredients being drenched in excessive sweeteners, no matter how healthy the sweetener is touted to be. But this bar did not gross me out like other bars did, and in fact, satisfied my sweet tooth pretty well.<br /><br />Since I am a chocolate lover, especially dark ones, the smell and taste of the cocoa in the bar added to my satisfaction rating. There was also a subtle hint of coffee, but it was almost undetectable if you're not mindful enough.<br /><br />I wish the bars are bigger though. I'm in no way a large man, but I find one bar hardly makes me feel full, though it does stop my hunger pang.<br /><br />After trying this product, I've since moved on to other flavors. I found that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAE"">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.8-Ounce Bars, 16-Count</a> has almost the same taste as this. The coconut shreds in it have no taste but gives a distinctive coconut texture. But since this bar isn't made of organic ingredients, the price is lower than the Jocalat series. If budget is a concern to you, then you may want to consider that bar instead.<br /><br />One tip: As with any food bars, always eat Larabar with a full glass of water. Although not as hard and dry like other bars, it can get a bit dry on the throat when you're near the end."
4,"I like the oil a lot. And do everything with it. The only problem I had was with the way the shipping was handled.<br />The box was obviously too big, oil bottles were not wrapped. A few pieces of bobble wrapped throw inside box did not provide any protection. Bottles were arrived crushed to the point almost broken. Fortunately, the oil was solid not liquid, so no leaking. But I did read another reviews about honey, having problem with the way they were shipped, it got spilled all over the place."
4,"The price was great,and the coffee tast is very good. Good deal will buy again. The packs of coffee are still A pound not 11oz like others."
4,"this noodle is surprisingly tasty. though it advertise as spicy but i don't think it is that spicy more like mild to me."
4,"It's pretty good, but I added a tsp of vanilla and 2 tbl of maple syrup for a tastier result"
4,"HAVE PURCHASED THREE SO FAR. UNWRAPPED EACH CUBE PLACED ABOUT 15-20 IN FOOD PROCESSOR, GRANULATED ENTIRE CASE, YIELDED ALMOST 60oz, PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT AS SEASONING IS HEAVIER GRANULATED THAN MOST, GREAT VALUE IF YOU DON'T MIND A LITTLE TIME CONSUMING WORK AND HAVE THE EMPTY CONTAINERS. OUTSTANDING FLAVOR AND SPICINESS, HAVE ONLY USED IT SO FAR IN BAKING CHICKEN, CAN'T WAIT TO USE IT IN FRYING CHICKEN WINGS. WILL SET UP RECURRING ORDER AND DELIVERY SOON. OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE USED INDIVIDUAL CUBES FOR SAUSES,SALADS,MEAT ETC. EITHER WAY, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
4,"While this isn't the best ever curry mix available, it IS pretty good. What makes it worth buying is the simplicity. You literally just boil the bag in a pot of water, cut it open and pour it over cooked rice (or noodles) and you're done. Instant curry dinner for one. (or two if you are just snacking) The box is marked ""Hot"" and it's got a decent level of spice or heat, but it's not hot by my standards, if you're looking for fire breathing hot curry, you'll want to add some spices of your own and do some doctoring here. But again, for a quick curry fix or snack, it'll work fine. There are some small carrots & potatoes in the packet already & they are ok, totally edible. I usually cook a small lamb chop or pork chop to add to the rice for a full meal after a busy day - makes a nice enough cold weather meal with a favorite movie type of thing."
4,"Pretty much describes it all.  My wife loves it however made the comment that the two cakes received thus far were very similar in taste and design.  So 4 stars but it could have been 5 with a little more variety :D"
4,"This is a greasy product, but has good flavor.  The meat is soft, not too salty, and meaty.  I would buy again."
4,"I've tried the spaghetti & meatballs (which is really darned good), the hawaiin nuggets (which I'd rather not have to try again), and the vegetarian steak...  The Vegetarian steak is definitely edible, to the point where I'd be ok with eating it again.<br /><br />The ""steak"" bits are quite tasty, have a good texture, and quite plentiful.  The biggest issue with the veggie steak is the texture of the vegetables: on the box, it shows all sorts of nice yummy crisp looking veggies...  whereas it turns out its really just a gelatneous goo.  It's pretty yucky looking, but it tastes decent.<br /><br />Definitely good for camping, or if you need to eat kosher on a business trip."
4,"I've been a vegetarian for about six years and sometimes vegan. However after starting work at a high pressure job out of college, I fell into the pizza, quick convenience food trap and have gained thirty pounds. I am trying to get back into the healthy lifestyle I had during my first few years as a veggie but I got tired of my morning green smoothies and felt I needed a bigger kick. I got this product in the mail about 4 days after I ordered it and could not wait to try it.<br />I mixed it in about 1/2 a cup of bottled water first. Then I blended it with about  1 cup and a half of coconut milk and a few frozen peach slices.<br />I didn't like it at first so then I added three teaspoons of organic cane sugar.<br />It was delicious, a little chalky because I don't think I mixed it thoroughly with the water, but tasted something like Quick or those Slimfast powdered drinks.<br />Tomorrow I will add half a frozen banana and more peaches and will cut out the sugar.<br />I didn't have any coffee this morning either and didn't feel groggy at all. Will keep drinking and buy it again in the larger size."
4,"Just as described in previous reviews - light, delicate and perfect for those who enjoy white tea without added flavors."
4,"I don't know what it is about the white colored nylabone material; it is just so much softer than the yellowish material. Even though both are labeled ""Dura Chew"" The dogs have not yet taken off sizeable pieces of this bone, but they can leave pretty clear tooth markings. This chew needs closer monitoring than the other nylabones we have bought.<br /><br />*************<br />UPDATE: It is a little more than a year since I first put up this review and I just bought a liver flavored Nylabone that is also made from this white colored material. I'm uploading a customer photo to show the difference. If you have a dog that is an agressive chewer, you may want to stay away from the white nylabone material."
4,"This is a very tasty protein drink but a little high in calories for me, although absolutely fine for any males out there. I'd compare it to Muscle Milk in taste, which means it tastes very very good. It has 360 calories (about 160 calories too high for me), 20 grams of protein, and about 50 grams of carbs (also too high for me, but not too high as a recovery drink or for someone who can consume more carbs than I can).<br /><br />I tasted this and thought it was delicious, but since it doesn't fit my diet, I gave it to my 11 year old son who loved it and could definitely use the extra calories (we often get him supplemental shakes because he's kind of thin and can eat and eat yet has trouble gaining weight).<br /><br />Recommended for taste and if its makeup fits your eating /exercise plan."
4,"For the haters...seriously?  Protein bars never taste like real brownies or candy bars, so I feel like the complainers are newbies to the protein-scene.  If you find a decent one like this, with this much protein, you go with it.<br /><br />I eat one of these every night I work (night-shift cardiac nurse).  Makes me feel full without making me tired from excess carbs. Zero sugar in these; good job.<br /><br />Incidentally, I have had several types of the Think Thin bars, and I think this one tastes the best.  Not bad for a protein bar, and even better with a big cup of coffee.  Wish the chocolate flavor was a little stronger, but not a deal breaker.  I just bought another box."
4,"HUbby eats the GF cookies. He said these are really good. He does like the extreme Chocolate mini better but will eat these again"
4,"Pomegranate is supposed to have a lot of health benefits but the fruit is not easy to eat. This powder dissolves easily in water. I usually add raw honey and it tastes great."
4,"This is a great substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome. Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. I like mild best, and teriyaki is my second favorite. Both of these flavors are safe if you avoid spicy stuff like I do. If you like things hot, try some of the other flavors!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!"
4,"Okay, I have to say that Trident spearmint tastes pretty good, and has a pleasant mouth feel.  I find it better than the other flavors.<br /><br />I don't know whether Trident Gum actually fights cavities since I don't have any cavities, and don't chew this gum regularly.  I do think it's rather ironic, though, that ""trident"" means ""three teeth"" in Latin.  Did anyone research this before naming the product???"
4,"The rating above is for the chocolate itself, not for the taste of the chocolate I got from Amazon. My chocolate arrived as if it had melted and cooled a couple times and was flaky, this gave it a not so smooth texture, although the flavor was still there, I don't like the grainy feeling of melted and then cooled again chocolate that much. So I mostly use it for baking and ground it up to put in cereal and trail mixes.<br /><br />Try not to order this during the summer like I did. Other than that, the chocolate is great."
4,"These were a hit at my 3 year olds party, dessert table! I read the reviews so knew ahead that I would have to remove wrapper. It was, like stated, covered with black writing but I took scissors and snipped the plastic right off, it took me 15 mins for all of them. They were the perfect size for the 2-4 year olds, and were adorable. Would definitely buy again!!"
4,"I bought it because I read that Yerba Mate teas help you to lose weight, feel full and do what it indicates on the front of carton or bag. Which I found not to be true yet, with this flavor but I will still try other Yerba Mate teas because I like drinking tea and I believe that sometimes you have to give it, what you drink, take or apply, time to work.  Every morning, for three weeks I poured boiled water in a gourd; using one tea bag...I also work out, eat right and keep track of everything I do."
4,"Yes these are tasty little bears and even better when soaked in vodka. One should always save calories for booze and thought these would counter the calorie guilt of alcohol.  Alas the reviews are true and if you think you are in for a drunken night of romance think again you may be in for a night of flatulence and skid marks. Beware and indulge moderately.  Good price, less than half of retail stores."
4,"A really nice, smooth coffee with plenty of flavor.  Not bitter at all.  Does really well in my Kuerig machine."
4,"Both the product page and the seller were equally unenlightening, so I'll tell you: the package I got contains 3.5 ounces of black salt, packaged by Deep Foods."
4,"I've been trying a bunch of different flavors of the compleats meals and while this isn't a 'top five' for me it is still a good meal for what it is and I will likely buy more."
4,"I fairly recently got a package of various products from Omaha steaks as a birthday gift from a friend.  Included was a couple boxes of these prime rib slices.  I won't call them wonderful, there's no substitute for a prime rib sliced off of a freshly cooked roast in a well run steakhouse.  But for what they are, a precooked steak that's frozen, they aren't bad, and do make a good way to have a last minute entree for unexpected company and/or when one is in a rush and don't have too much time otherwise.<br /><br />I normally don't comment on other reviews in my own, and to be fair I already posted a comment in the one star review's comment section, the one titled ""YUCK"".  But a few comments here also if I may:  1)  The fellow complains about the lack of au jus.  It's a condiment.  It's like complaining about the lack of grated horseradish (I know people who like prime rib with such) or any other condiment people might eat with prime rib or steak in general not being with this.  Unless a package says that a condiment is included, I don't assume that such would be.  So without trying to belittle the author of ""YUCK"", I find his complaint to be unwarrented.  If he wishes there to be au jus, there's au jus that one can buy from the spice section of most grocery stores.  Or one can use the juices in the individual packaging for each steak slice and try to make some if one knows how.  2)  Although again I don't think these warrent a five star review, they are hardly flavorless.  Not a strong flavor, but I did detect a bit of a flavor from some rub that was put on the outside before cooking and slicing.  The steaks themselves DID taste like prime rib to me, albeit obviously prime rib that had been frozen.  So I'm not sure what ""YUCK"" got, but it apparently was different from my prime rib slices."
4,"What a wonderful listing of ingredients! The chocolate pieces in this bar help satisfy my sweet-tooth, and the hearty whole grain ingredients give this bar more heft in your stomach to help satiate your hunger longer.<br /><br />It's nice to have a bar that I can share with my vegan friends as well. However, it is not gluten-free due to the fact that it is packed on the same machines that pack gluten products, and it contains oats which some gluten-free individuals cannot handle (via the Earnest Eats FAQ [...]).<br /><br />I rated this bar 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be a bit tough to chew on at times. I have this bar under Amazon Subscribe & Save and some shipments are softer than others, so it may be an issue of how old the package is. Even with the toughest shipment I have received, it still has a nice chewy texture, so it's a delicious afternoon snack that you can eat in good conscience. When you're eating whole ingredients, it's going to chew a little bit more than our typical over-processed bars on the market - and that's a good thing!  Yum!"
4,"After reading some of the other reviews, I was expecting more flavor to the  tea.  It is good.  I let it infuse a bit longer than other flavors to encourage the flavor development."
4,"I just love these cookies - the texture is somewhere between a sugar cookie and shortbread but with a nice buttery note that is unlike either of the others. The best I could describe the flavor is sort of like pound cake, but in crisp cookie form. Perfect with tea, coffee, milk or even just by themselves. These are great to give as gifts during the holidays too; I've never met anyone young or old that didn't like them. They are well packaged with the little muffin liners so rarely a broken one and they keep for a really long time. The tin seals nice and tight and is reusable.<br /><br />My favorites are the ones topped with the sparkling sugar and it's a good thing there are four tins here because then I don't have to feel guilty about keeping all of the sugar-topped ones from *one* box for myself :)"
4,"My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and in our experience, lunch is the hardest meal of the day. When we are at home we are fine, but when we are at work or school, it is either difficult to find safe Gluten Free food or a clean enough location in which to eat that food without contaminating it by all the meals previously eaten there. We try to carry our lunch when possible, but we rely on safety net foods such as the Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate and Protein Bars to save us in a pinch or help us have energy to get home."
4,"Yes, another new cat food folks.  Another new invention to see if your cat will approve.  Once again, I have a ""yeah"" and a ""nay.""  My male, who was raised on meat, hates this stuff.  He won't go near it and actually will jump back away from his dish if I put it in there!  A bit dramatic, I think, but you at least get the picture!  But, my female who is a junk food lover thinks this stuff is all there should be for sale on the shelf!  She gobbles this stuff up like there's no tomorrow.  The one thing you should know about Fancy Feast is that it is pretty good food for your cat.  Although my female likes junk food like Meow Mix and Whiskas (check with your vet - he will tell you how bad those foods are), I'm very glad she will eat this since it has a high protein level.  Why my male hates it, I have no idea.  Just grab a can at your local grocery to test it out before ordering an entire case.  Recommend!"
4,"I received a box of Kind Fruit and Nut delight for Christmas.  I tried it for the first time and it was so good, such a delightful and fulfilling taste that is both good and good for me.  I like the fact that it is all natural, no funny taste and no yacky after taste.  You can actually taste the fruits in each bar. I have a sweet tooth and Kind bar satisfies my craving.  Try it and you will see what I mean.  I recommend this to anyone trying to eat sensibly and indulgent at the same time."
4,"very happy with price and taste of this coffee we rate it one of the better tasting coffees that we have used"
4,"it's pretty good if you like alot of paprika . I suggest and trying to make your own, you'll take more pride in it"
4,"I selected Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count based solely on a five sentence blurb in the amazon.com/VINE offering to me in its monthly newsletter to sample and to review. There were no instructions on how to prepare the brew. I did not worry. I expected the shipped coffee to contain enough instructions on arrival. It did not.<br /><br />If, however, I had gone to the non-VINE website of Amazon I would have received a clue how to brew the coffee: ""Directions<br />For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers.""<br /><br />I don't own a ""single server home coffee pod brewer,"" so the test was going to prove difficult at best, although I did not think so at the time.<br /><br />Then came in the mail an attractively packaged, colorful cardboard box, full of small print texts extolling various aspects of the product with Lion of Judah logo, photo of a Rastafarian man and a statement from musician Bob Marley about how he had founded his organic coffee and tea company as a tribute to his father who had come from Nine Mile, Jamaica.<br /><br />Very instructive. But no brewing instructions anywhere. I scissored open the air-sealed plastic cover for one of the 15 small pods enclosed of ground coffee. No instructions.<br /><br />Here are the various ways I went about making Marley coffee:<br /><br />(1) Were these 15 like similar pods I had seen in motels with DIY coffee makers?Where you toss pods in a plastic  filter and add hot water into the back of the machine. Then throw a switch. Expect two cups of coffee to emerge. So I scissored open four plastic bags, detecting in the process a beyond faint aroma that I had years earlier come to associate with kidneys for breakfast in bed and breakfasts in Ireland. I tossed four pods into my Mr. Coffee Machine<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041847R4"">Mr. Coffee CG12 12-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, White</a> and added enough water in my to make eight cups of coffee. No paper filter. Result: tasty, several ingredients detected. Very weak!<br /><br />(2) After discussion with my wife, I next decided to make a mere two cups of coffee using only two pods in Mr. Coffee, this time placing a paper filter beneath the pods. Same initial urine smell. Same good taste. Stronger.<br /><br />(3) Still my wife and I, in the absence of written instructions, decided there must be a simpler, cleaner way. We next treated a pod as if it were a single serving tea bag -- minus a string. We therefore put one pod in a coffee mug and poured boiling water over it. Same Irish kidneys smell. Decent taste when done. Rather a mess, however, fishing out the pod with a spoon.<br /><br />Bottom line: even when weak, Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count offered a strikingly better than average taste. I would drink it again if only I had the right equipment.<br /><br />-OOO-"
4,"These nuts are really fresh and delicious! I have them on a regular monthly order.  I find them to have more salt than necessary, so shake them through a sieve to remove about 1/2 the sea salt."
4,"If you love granola, you'll love this cocoa-flavored one from Nature's Path.  It has a very nice cocoa intensity and chunky pieces of dark chocolate.  It's also not cloying in sweetness, which I find off-putting in some granola. It contains some pieces big enough to snack on but it's also lovely with milk.  However, the red berries are almost non-existent.  I've eaten half the bag already and only gotten 3 measly pieces of spongy strawberry that were smaller than green peas. I can barely taste it.  For almost $4 a bag, I expect to see red berries when the package says red berries.  It would have been perfect otherwise.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- delicious<br />- made of whole grains, 0 g. of transfat, low sodium, cholesterol-free<br />- certified organic and non-GMO (made in a kitchen, not a lab)<br />- Nature's Path promises to donate up to $1 million dollars to food banks for every bag of Love Crunch bought.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- not nearly enough red berries<br />- a bit pricey<br />- serving size is a minuscule 1/4 cup but has 140 calories and 55 of those from fat<br />- produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts, and tree nuts so people with allergies - beware!"
4,"What a nice drink to cuddle up with on a winter evening.  The coffee and rich chocolate are a wonderful combination and this is a premium product for sure.  Of course, chocolate covered expresso beans are my favorite treat.<br />I am not a coffee snob, but I do grind my beans every day; it's just one of my little luxuries.  I thought, ahhh, chocolate coffee would not really fit in.  I was wrong.  This is just a terrific winter drink!  Let it snow!"
4,"These grapefruit slices are delicious, but beware on two points:<br /><br />- 5 pounds is a heck of a lot for one person (last time I ordered it lasted for months, even with me sporadically handing it out to others).<br />- The candy hardens with time and loses a bit of its chewiness / gumminess.  (Still tastes good, though).<br /><br />I'm going to experiment with using a more airtight container to see if they stay chewy for longer."
4,"This hot sauce is great. Spicy but not too spicy, you can really taste the green chilies and Habenero, and what an amazing color! I love using this stuff."
4,"My son loves this product - it is healthy, convenient (packaging) and since he refuses all other greens we've tried, this is a good way to encourage him to eat green veggies.  The one drawback is that the price is on the high side.  I am now wondering if it is worth the value, and will probably try other alternatives if price continues to go up."
4,"First time ordering this brand of coconut oil. It seemed to over heat a little easier, but not sure if it was the oil or the kettle. I will be cleaning the unit and running again."
4,"I have been eating this soup for several years. It is very good and I like the Tomato as well."
4,"Specifically marketed towards the health conscious, the all-organic ""GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers"" is a pretty good meal-to-go alternative. The cracker and salmon combo is quite tasty, fairly rich tasting, while not being too salty, while the fruit and nut mix and the organic chocolate bar both provide a nice sweet treat. About the only thing I didn't really enjoy was the dry roasted edamame; it wasn't awful tasting (and was particularly filling), but the taste was bland and dry to my palate.<br /><br />A few caveats: ""GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers"" is not for everyone, to be sure. Those weaned on Kraft ""lunchables"" will probably miss the heavily processed and salty taste they have become accustomed to with those types of meals-to-go.<br /><br />Also, as is the case with so many healthy food alternatives, this is clearly priced towards an upscale market. While the cost of $5.00 per box is competitive with (or if you live in the NYC area, actually cheaper than) other health-oriented meal-to-go alternatives, it is certainly priced higher than mainstream meal-to-go products, such as the aforementioned Kraft ""Lunchables"" (priced at around $3.60 a box here on Amazon.com). This means that those on a tight budget are once again left out in the cold when it comes to choosing healthy foods alternatives. When is that inequity ever going to be truly addressed?<br /><br />All things aside, ""GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers"" is a good meal-to-go alternative and worth picking up for those so inclined."
4,"I received a box of Kind Fruit and Nut delight for Christmas.  I tried it for the first time and it was so good, such a delightful and fulfilling taste that is both good and good for me.  I like the fact that it is all natural, no funny taste and no yacky after taste.  You can actually taste the fruits in each bar. I have a sweet tooth and Kind bar satisfies my craving.  Try it and you will see what I mean.  I recommend this to anyone trying to eat sensibly and indulgent at the same time."
4,"My husband and I tried this product along with the corresponding shampoo. His hair is dry, thinning, and brittle, very curly but not color treated. Mine is normal, slightly wavy, with good body, and salon colored.<br /><br />He likes this product for the moisturizing effect. We have tried just about every product we can find but his hair continues to be fragile.  This is the first product that he said actually makes a difference. His hair is softer and breaks less after only 2 weeks.<br /><br />For my color treated hair, it's made no positive difference. I don't like the texture feel of the hair when wet, and my color has faded twice as fast as it does using John Frieda conditioner for red hair.<br /><br />We'll probably keep buying this product for my husband's brittle hair, but I've stopped using it on mine."
4,"I cannot say enough about Larabars. Simple ingredients, whole ingredients, and a great snack. However, the one caveat is that the ingredients are not organic and that is why I am providing a 4 star rating. Some foods like Dates with very thin skins I would prefer to have an organic option. I wish that they would offer an organic version of this bar. However, they do taste amazing and are probably one of the best options out there if not the best. These are perfect for me at University for between classes when I am on the go and do not have enough time to go to the cafeteria quite yet.<br /><br />I would recommend trying the flavors before you buy a whole package, however if your willing to take a plunge, the top flavors I have tried so far have been Chocolate Coconut Chew, Coconut Cream Pie, Cinnamon Roll, and Cashew Cookie in that order. Some flavors such as Apple Pie, Cherry Pie, Key Lime Pie, I find can get old a lot faster and I would probably not go through a 16 box of them before I got somewhat sick of them.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Very tasty (LOVE the Chocolate Coconut Chew and the Cinnamon Roll).<br />+Simple ingredients.<br />+Whole food ingredients.<br />+Small, portable.<br />+Price is very reasonable.<br />+Filling.<br /><br />CONS<br />+No organic option.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />The price at Amazon is superb compared to elsewhere, you probably won't find anything in this price range at this quality, from what I have experienced. They are a good snack when you are on the go, perfect for a University student at that. Simple, whole food ingredients, the way it is meant to be. Definitely recommended. Will get a 5 star rating once they release an organic version!"
4,"I ordered a case of sardines through Amazon Grocery last month and they didn't travel well, the box arrived soaked in oil. 4 cans had popped open and seeped fishy oil all over the rest of my order. Upon inspection I could see that the design of the seals on the cans and the way that they were packed in their box made it a simple matter to pop the seals, and any bump in transit could do it. Sardines are not returnable items. Imagine the mess of shipping them back? Amazon handled my complaint in excellent fashion regardless.<br /><br />So, I thought that I had better try it again. I ordered a totally different kind-same brand. These sardines are not quite as tasty as the others but they are quite acceptable. My cats like them and most essential: they arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />That being said, if you don't have Amazon Prime shipping you might consider getting it. It pays for itself quite quickly and it is SO darned convenient. I live in the country and I work at home. It's a pain to go to town to shop for groceries, books, music, whatever. Amazon provides so many products I need. Amazon Prime gets them to me quickly and usually, painlessly (those leaky sardines were my only problem among dozens of shipments).<br /><br />Amazon does a tremendous job! I'm one happy customer."
4,"My daughter was given New born in hospital, so we decided to stick with this for first three months, occasionally she had gas issues other than that, this product worked great, and my daughter weight gain was normal. Only issue is its not available in many stores, so have to get it online.."
4,"I have always loved sweet cereals growing up. As an adult, I still have a kid-like love for certain cereals. Frosted Flakes, however, was not on my checklist of cereals that I loved growing up. Kellogs now introduces Crunchy Nut, which, in my opinion is a modified version of Frosted Flakes which add nut bits onto the flakes. So if you love Frosted Flakes, there is no reason why you would not like this brand of cereal. Stay crunchy in milk and sweetens the milk as you go. There is nothing entirely new or original here, but its tasty and you wont be disappointed."
4,"Like other reviewers on here, I was looking for beef jerky under $20/lb. I was also quite impressed by this product's claim that it lacks MSG, artificial flavorings, nitrates, and preservatives. I decided to give the sweet n' spicy variety a go, and I was quite impressed despite the lackluster reviews. The texture, I must admit, lacked consistency; some bites were tougher than others. Overall, however, the flavor tasted great and the quality of the beef was apparent. If you're looking for inexpensive, natural beef jerky, you can stop your hunt right here."
4,"Great product. My dog loves it and has no idea she's eating nasty tasting pills inside the yummy pill pockets."
4,"Its nice to have a 'treat' to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda---they love the taste and I don't feel like I'm having to compromise any quality .....<br />I don't enjoy soda but I do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can--great product at a good price!"
4,"First of all, nothing tastes exactly like sugar. Having said that, however, I give this product high marks because it tastes good and I don't detect any aftertaste or bitterness when I use it. I made peach cobbler and it was excellent. A simple blueberry conserve made with fresh berries, Ideal and maybe a little cinnamon and/or amaretto liqueur is just marvelous with toast at breakfast or a pancake and is actually way better than sugary jam in my opinion. It doesn't sweeten tea as well as it works in baked goods (not sure why), and if I put it in yoghurt, it takes a couple of minutes to dissolve properly. Ideal does have a small amount of maltodextrin and sucralose. Maybe that is why it tastes just a little better and I prefer it overall to straight xylitol products. Not many stores carry it in my area but it is worth ordering online. I am diabetic so this has worked very well for me. This type of ""alcohol sugar"" product (xylitol) was approved by my diet counsellors at our local hospital educational unit."
4,"My wife and I love this Italian coffee since we practically grew up with it...<br />Out of the 4 in the pack, one of the bricks had lost its pressure but it still brewed greatly.<br />The order arrived promptly and met expectation like the service provided.<br />Thank you,<br />M. & G."
4,"I have loved Total Raisin Bran for years now, but am disappointed that they switch to sugar coating the raisins. They are already sweet enough as is.<br /><br />Other than that, this is an awesome choice for a breakfast cereal."
4,"This Essentia 9.5 pH drinking Water is good tasting, having no real discernible flavor, and is quite refreshing. The 1.5 Liter bottle is more than I typically drink in one sitting, even after working out, so consumed my test bottle over two days.<br /><br />My first observation is that does taste significantly better than our municipal provided tap water and on par with the filtered water that we buy in bulk for regular ""hydration"" when working out. I did not notice any immediate quantifiable benefits from the adjusted pH or additives, but did feel more refreshed over drinking plain water.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced alternative to sports drinks and regular bottled water!<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
4,"Great taste with no saturated or trans fat.  A little high priced though, but well worth it for controlling cholesterol."
4,"I enjoy iced coffee drinks and prefer them strong. I put the can in the refrigerator to chill it rather than pour the drink over ice and dilute it. It had a nice, pleasant taste. Not too sweet with a nice smooth coffee taste but it didn't taste much like cappuccino. I usually make my own espresso and ice it, but this would be a nice alternative in an emergency or take with me in the car."
4,"Got this item because it had Prime shipping on it despite the other two negative reviews. Tried it out, actually worked just fine. Since cats don't really like old grass and mostly like to eat young grass, this worked perfectly. I put water in it and let it sprout, which it did fairly successfully. It grew much more than I thought it would after a week.<br /><br />My cat munched on it and looked fairly satisfied, and vomited up a bunch of grass later to thank me, which I pretty much expected. For those of you buying pet grass, you should note that cats appear to be designed to vomit grass, food, water, dust, and fur. But grass will probably add more vomiting, even though they like to eat it.<br /><br />This box sprouted fine, cat liked it fine, price was ok. I'd get it again, it was hassle free, and i'm lazy, I threw the whole box out when the grass got old enough that the cat wouldn't eat it anymore."
4,"Based on my multiple experiences, I recommend:<br /><br />1. Buy extra Pantry Pest Traps! $ave at Home Depot!<br /><br />2. Use traps when FIRST seeing evidence of moths.<br /><br />3. Cluster multiple traps (2-4) on top of the fridge.<br /><br />Can this product be improved? Yes! Make a larger sticky surface to trap moths. Most of, but not all of the inside surface of the trap is sticky. To help, I suggest...<br /><br />4. Buy a package of fly paper ribbon/strips and temporarily mount 1 from the ceiling close to the Safer Pantry Pest Traps to trap more bugs.<br /><br />Unrelated to the product, due to re-infestations, I now additionally do the following:<br /><br />Toss ALL baking mix, flour, rice, cereal, macaroni, ramen, noodles, mac-n-cheese mix, pizza mix, gravies, chili mix, spice mix, etc. into garbage bags, seal and immediately put into an outside trash can.<br /><br />Thoroughly and carefully clean out/vacuum all cabinets/drawers paying special attention to crevices and all surfaces. I carefully clean product containers returned to the cabinet/drawers. It only takes 2 moths/larvae/eggs to re-infest.<br /><br />I stopped buying food in bulk, and I end up with fresher products and less cluttered cabinets and drawers.<br /><br />I now store susceptible foods in glass containers with screw-on lids, it's a lot easier to see a moth that way, and a good way to recycle glass.<br /><br />NOTE: The Pantry Pest Trap is also sold under other names. I will certainly buy this product again and I keep at least 1 box of unopened traps in my cupboard just waiting for the buggers!"
4,"Very nice cookies and Amazon shipping was also fast. My kid loves them. The only thing is the price. I bought similar ones in Costco before with much cheaper unit price. However, couldn't find anymore in Costco after Xmas."
4,"The Triple ginger cookies are a real find. I love the crystalized ginger in each cookie - a nice chewy little nugget. In addition they are relatively low in calories and have no trans fats."
4,"I cannot believe how much I love these things. The first one I popped in my mouth made my eyes water because after a point ginger can get pretty spicy but I just love that flavor. These things for me are incredibly addictive and I don't use the word lightly. I really have to watch the portion control.<br /><br />Now that I am used to the spiciness, if I'm not paying attention I can chomp through a bag pretty quickly and that is potent stuff. It's better for the calories and the teeth to work through the candies slowly right? But yikes these things are sweet-spicy good!<br /><br />On the other hand my husband tried one only to spit his into his dinner napkin pretty disgusted....So, definitely an acquired taste.<br /><br />One observation as a simple hard-candy-eating, non-medical, lay-person, who suffers with severe asthma, these things were soothing to the throat and chest on a couple of rough breathing days.<br /><br />With the next shipment of ginger drops I am also getting a bag of the clove flavored candies just to see if they will be able to stand up to the ginger so I'll have an alternate. :)"
4,"My order was filled and the product was delivered quickly, as promised.  The gum was kind of crunchy at first, though it is not outdated, so I don't think it could be stale - just a little strange. Once you start chewing it, it's fine."
4,"I've never used pest repellent before however live at the edge of a forest treeline so we constantly have skunks, deer, racoons and other critters coming out of the woods. I like the deer but don't like the skunks, for some reason something startles them around my AC unit and when that happens the house just starts to stink. We also have some bushes in our front yard that neighborhood cats seems to like to use as a bathroom. Typically daily I'd go out and see an animal, yesterday I put this out around the house and I hadn't seen the guys roaming around which is unusual.<br /><br />Also, I appreciate the design of this container. It has an adjustable cap on it that doubles as a dispenser so you can sprinkle a little bit or a lot depending on your application.<br /><br />The repellent itself has a peppery smell, it's a bit overwhelming at first but after it's been on the ground for 15-30 minutes the scent dies down.<br /><br />So far so good. I would recommend this if you have a critter problem."
4,"I enjoyed the flavor of these but they were a bit dry and therefore very crumbly. The flavor reminds me of the peanut butter cookies my mom used to make with the Hershey's Kiss on top. I have a whole package so I may try microwaving the cookie for a few seconds to see if the crumbliness and dryness disappear. Will report back when I do."
4,"This tea is really good for the type of tea it is.  A friend mentioned how this was the best tea she's ever tried so I gave it a shot.  Unfortunately. I tend more towards flavored teas, therefore the 4-star rating.  In my opinion, the Ahmad Peach & Passion Fruit Black Tea cannot be beat.  That is by far my most favorite tea."
4,"These are awesome. I had to get used to the texture but once I did that, all was wonderful after that. I get creative and knowing that they are calorie free makes it all the better."
4,"I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A"">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack."
4,"Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert."
4,"My son loves these, but they can be expensive.  Getting them from amazon is much less expensive- especially since my son can go through a bag a day (and there's actually peas in there!)  I have to say that they are a love 'em or hate 'em kind of thing.  They have a crispy cheese puff texture, with a salty pea flavor.  My advice would be to get a bag from a ""natural"" type grocery store first before you invest in a dozen."
4,"I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats."
4,"I had to adjust to the taste of these after a few bites, but I found the smoky chocolate flavor and acid of the fruit blended nicely. It has only a slightly gummy chew, but that is ok because it soft enough that it doesn't wear your jaw out.  This is not a crunchy granola bar.  I really enjoyed these, though I thought the calories were a little high at 160 each and I suspect they gave me gas."
4,"These are normal Honey Maid graham crackers.  Who doesn't love them?  I found them as tasty as ever.<br /><br />The main difference in this product is a packaging difference.  While normal graham crackers come in two long packs with many crackers, this one comes with the crackers already broken down to squares.  Each small square pack of eight crackers comes in its own wrapper.<br /><br />This is a great, simple idea.  If you're a busy, on-the-go person, I think you'll find this product very convenient.  It would be great for packing a lunch for school or work in a hurry.  It would also be great for moms to throw in a purse or diaper bag to have a fast, easy snack for toddlers.  Also, in our family we find that we might only want to eat a couple of crackers, but once you open a pack you feel like you either have to eat them all or let them go to waste.  This product solves that problem.<br /><br />I would say that it depends on the price of the product if it really makes sense to buy these.  Ziplock bags are pretty cheap, and it doesn't take too terribly long to throw a few crackers in there.  Also if you have a large family that would consume an entire pack of graham crackers before these go stale, then this product adds no benefit, is harder to get into, and is worse for the environment.  All in all, though, I think this product has a place in the market.  If you're like me and find yourself trying to grab something quickly while you're always running late, this is a great choice."
4,"Just tried this for the first time today.  To be honest it's been years since I've had a ""real"" mac and cheese from the box.  However I thought this was great.  I adjusted the ratio for the sauce, using 1 tablespoon of oil instead of 3, 2 tablespoons of water and adding 1 heaping tablespoon of Tofutti sour cream to powdered sauce mixture.  This worked great for me, and made it seem much creamier than I had expected from other reviews.  I also kept out a little of the starchy pasta liquid before I drained it to help coat the pasta with the sauce.  Added in some cooked chicken, fresh tomato and parsley.  It was delicious,  I'll definitely do this again!"
4,"Illy Issimo Cappucino is an exceedingly rich, quite sweet, cappuccino drink that is an Italian espresso style coffee drink with low fat milk and cocoa. While I love its very sweet flavor, I thought it needed some improvement by diluting it 50% with fresh milk. I am surprised that a drink as rich as this one is has only 100 calories per can; it's also low sodium too with only 60 milligrams per can. Anyone who is diet conscious will appreciate both salient facts. This is truly a cocoa and cappuccino lover's delight of a drink. I highly recommend it."
4,"Like others have said, the consistency of this stage 2 combo is very thin, but it could be thickened with oatmeal or cereal. My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option."
4,"I really enjoyed this cereal and am looking forward to buying more.  They're corn flakes with a hint of honey and roasted nut sweetness and crunchiness.  I had also tried the Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, the ones shaped like 'O's and that had much more of a roasted peanut taste which wasn't what I was looking for in a cereal, although if you're a real peanut lover it would be right up your alley.  For just a bit of honey/roasted nut taste I highly recommend the flakes."
4,"I like them a lot, but with all the sweets, I've put on the pounds.<br />:-("
4,"These natural chewy candies have a wonderful unique flavor. A delightful alternative to all of the artificially flavored candy on the market."
4,"Excellent dark/strong coffee.  Seems like I'm like a lot of the other reviewers here who are fans of this one.  Others that I like are Coffee People Jet Fuel, Van Houtte Extra Bold Dark, Coffee People Extra Bold French and Black Tiger, but this one is my standard.<br /><br />I have this on subscribe and save for every other month which was a great deal, but I was running low and was going to ship my next shipment early and saw the price jumped to $28.80.  Even with the 15% S&S discount, you're at $24, which is $0.50 a cup.  Hope this is just a temporary price bump.  The Emeril's decaf is still at $23 before S&S.  Might have to switch to the 50 pack Jet Fuel in frustration free packaging ($18 after S&S)."
4,"When in doubt my daughter will aways eat sweet potatoes.  These are good.  Sweet potatoes and water.  However, they are a little runny.  I think they thin it out more than they should.  But it is ok.  Ella's is my favorite.  They have a nice thick baby food.  Earths best is my second favorite followed by Gerber."
4,"It is good and soothing to drink. I have not tried it too many times yet. I am sharing with my sister."
4,"Having had a poor experience with another Louisiana food vendor,<br />was somewhat skeptical about ordering this product.  Turns out<br />this King Cake is a good product.  It -  does require yeast and two dough risings - something I am not good at- and it wasn't that hard and the dough actually did rise.<br />The end product was colorful and tasty."
4,"Part of the reason I tried this is the availability via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.<br />Being able to combine serious quality feline food with the convenience of having it show up on my doorstep is something of a no-brainer for me. The fact that having it delivered means I'm visiting those pet emporiums less and therefore getting all wanty over the cats up for adoption probably is a good thing for me.<br />As for the food itself, my crew has responded rather favorably to it. We had a little extra vomiting initially as they adjusted, but I've had that happen with almost anything drastically new I tried.<br />I think this food has helped my oldest two the most. One had been getting increasingly sedentary and I suspected she was having joint pain. Now she's back to jumping up on furniture and being much more interactive with us. Her coat looks good too. She's actually at her best ever.<br />My other old girl had been having the occasional seizure this past year. These have decreased in frequency. She already had a good coat but damned if it doesn't look even more luscious. You'd never believe she's a mature cat.<br />My other two don't have issues that this food addresses, but I want my healthy ones living long and healthy lives. I wish I could say my big boy cat was a little less big, but I know that's not the purpose of this food. And I know in his case, no matter what his diet is, he's gonna stench up that litter box.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried this food for them. Very worthwhile."
4,"This is good Jerky! The Jerky police will not come because the original formula has a sweet taste to it. It is probably their own ""original formula"". The pieces are sized right. I give it a Texas style yeee haw!"
4,"I normally purchase the Lavazza Grand Crema pods for use with my Breville espresso machine, and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different, so I ordered a box of Espressione Classic Espresso instead. Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my ""real"" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods."
4,"I bought this brand because it was recommended by Nourishing Traditions author Sally Fallon.  It's got too much Dijon mustard taste for me - that's not what I think of when I think of mayo.  Another brand that follows Fallon's guidelines is Wilderness Family Naturals mayonnaise - also has a mustard flavor, but not as strong."
4,"These dark chocolate almond granola bars are quite delicious. On taste alone I would give them 5 out of 5.<br /><br />But, like previous reviewers, my bars are a syrupy, sticky kind of mess. Not extremely bad, but enough that you do want to wash your hands afterwards. Because it sticks to the packaging it is nearly impossible to not use your fingers to pry the gooey tastiness off the wrapper.<br /><br />So, again I agree with previous reviewers: this is not a grab, eat on the go snack. Unless you like sticky fingers.<br /><br />I definitely don't regret my purchase, especially because subscribe and save makes these bars that much cheaper!"
4,"I was very pleased with the service.  Items arrived promptly and in good condition."
4,"I love the way these taste ice cold. One of my all-time favorites. And the best thing? It's calorie free. Just like the Zevia, though, it is not very budget friendly if you are a heavy soda drinker. I'm no doctor, but I would still, however, recommend treating yourself to a Blue Sky at least twice a week. =)"
4,"Contains fiber, omega-3's and other good things, but what does it taste like?<br /><br />Actually, it tastes pretty good - sort of nutty and the cinnamon is there, but not overpowering.<br /><br />I tried it as is from the bag. Was a little dry and the pieces are a little small to handle when eaten that way. But still, not bad.<br /><br />The package suggests eating it in milk or on yogurt which I think would be a good way to eat the product. I'll have to try that and get back to you.<br /><br />From what I can see, the price works out to be about $6 for 11 ounces. Sounds a little high, but it is very healthy stuff. I'd say give it a try."
4,"Quality ingredients!<br />A little pricey, but isn't everything now? (and they say there is no inflation)<br />I've had other Emerald trail mixes, as well as Diamond nuts (the holding co.) and the quality and taste has always been superior."
4,"These are a great snack. It's powered cheese and not as good as Cheez-it's but it definitely packs a bigger crunch and satisfies the craving in less pieces than cheez-it's or other products have. One bag will take me a week or two to finish when a similar sized box of Cheez-it's is gone in half the time. They are similar in nutritional value I'd say. If you're a Cheez-it, cheese nips or other cheese cracker fan give these a try if you're looking for something different. You will not be disappointed!"
4,"The price was very reasonable, the description of product was clear and I  had no confusion except having to choose one color over another--good selection of colors. It fits well, washes and dries nicely and is a good addition."
4,"Both my wife and I like this coffee.  one brew per cup for her is how she likes.  I brew a cup 1-1/2 times to get the flavor I like.  Very good price.  If there is a down side it would be the container is not your typical k-kup, rather a round filter at the bottom holding the coffee.  It works fine in the Keurig and we keep ours unused in an air tight container to keep fresh"
4,"Mints are great, of course, but I thought I would use this review space to fill you in on the details not included in the product listing.  The tin itself is approximately 4.5"" tall and 4"" in diameter.  There is a nutrition information sticker nearly covering the lid but it is easily removed without leaving any sticky residue.  The mints inside are all loose in one plastic bag so NOT individually wrapped if that is what you are looking for (I would prefer even if it would mean less fit in).  This also means that you lose some of the detail imprinted on the mints since they are all banging up against each other (they aren't quite as pretty as they could be).  Hope that helps if you are considering as it is all information I would have appreciated prior to ordering."
4,"If you are a fan of licorice then this candy is for you but only for those of you that really love this taste. If you are only a moderate fan of licorice then you may want to pass on this.<br /><br />Because this is an intense licorice ride. It's a great chew and a punch of flavor."
4,"First, a couple of minor negatives with these cookies.<br /><br />First is the name. For years Nabisco advertised, ""A cookie is just a cookie, but Newtons are fruit and cake."" Why the Nabisco marketing gurus would think that it was a good idea to associate the ""Newtons"" name with these thin, crisp cookies is beyond me.<br /><br />Next is the packaging. The trend today is toward recycled-content paperboard packaging, such as the one Nabisco used for their new <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LA1LKI"">Ritz Crackerful Multigrain Crackers</a>. These cookies come in a foil-lined bag with a plastic liner, neither of which can be recycled.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are quite good. They have a light texture similar to that of a shortbread or butter cookie. There is a nice light sweet flavor that is not overpowering. As is often the case when you use dried fruit in a cookie, the fig bits are a tad hard and chewy. I thought these go best with a beverage. Tea, coffee, soft drink, and even (according to Mrs. Boilermate), wine. We both agreed these are ""adult"" cookies.<br /><br />While we prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968"">Cranberry Citrus Oat</a> flavor by a slight margin, we will buy these, too."
4,"If you are one of the beef jerky lovers who really enjoys the soft tangyness of beef jerky that is most resembled in terriaki flavored beef jerky, you should know that it is extremely hard to find such kinds. Sometimes it's just sheer luck that you get a bag of the same texture you want. To me, I felt that this beef jerky wasn't as good as some of them but definitely better than a lot of the main brands out there. This bag, has a LOT of beef jerky, and it is somewhat soft. However, it isn't like chewy/tangy and is still a little dry. Some people like it, but to me the texture is not great. The flavor profile though is delicious."
4,"I was a little leary on ordering this soda as I have never tried any of it. I am trying to get products that are more natural without all the additives. I decided to try this one because my 6 year old really loves Dr. Pepper. He loved the taste of it, it does have the taste of dr. pepper, just not as sweet. I would buy this again."
4,"My dog likes thse alot..He runs to his bedroom to eat them, which is reserved for just his special treats..Can't say his breath is any better but he just started eating them a month ago,or so.."
4,"My cat loved this kibbled, so I ordered more. However, when it came, it said on the package ""cats love our new shape""....BS....they changed it from little star shapes to round pellets...probably due decrease cost of production. Luckily, my cat started eating it after a day or so, but I was annoyed. I'm slowly introducing another, much less expensive (but organic) kitty food from Trader Joe's into her diet, mixing it with this one. We'll see...I have a bad feeling that the shape isn't the only thing they changed about their product!"
4,"Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste."
4,"I bought these from Amazon because they are hard to find in the part of the country that I am at. I can buy the regular ""original"" flavor in the convenient store for twice as much, but they don't carry any other flavors. The ranch so far are the best flavor. If you don't know what Corn Nuts are, picture big crunchy fried kernels of corn with salt and flavorings added. They are VERY crunchy, you can't eat these while someone is sleeping next to you. If that sounds like something interesting to you, buy them, they are very good, they are probably healthier than other far more processed snacks, are very filling and for the price, you can't beat it."
4,"My cats eat it that is all I can say.  I try and buy the best food available but we cat owners can only say our cats eat it or will not eat it.  What my cats really like is just tuna you by at the grocery store but I use this only for a treat.  They eat hard food primarily and I use the more expensive brand."
4,"I love these things, warm pork rinds that tast fresh and the size of the bag is just the right size"
4,"The new frustration free packaging for k-cups is terrific! Thank you AMAZON.COM.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is one of our favorites for flavored coffee. Second only to their Butter Toffee. However, if you are wanting a bold wake-me-up, this is not going to please you. It's a pretty mild blend. When will someone make a really bold flavored coffee? Surely it is possible. I am a big fan of Emeril's Big Easy for my morning brew but later in the day or after dinner, Gloria Jean's Hazlenut is perfect."
4,"I give this cracker a 4 star only because its expensive.  Its a good tasting cracker plain or with a dip.  Its hard to find a cracker that is wheat, dairy, soy, or free of most chemicals.  The shinny surface is typical of rice flour crackers I've tried before.  Because it's made in the same factory as wheat or nuts is not necessarily a reason to not use this product.  If you want to try different crackers, try a box from Walmart (Michigan) then purchase online.  Thank you ""Back to Nature Foods."""
4,"This is a really smooth, not bitter tasting coffee. Great price when on sale. I have tried many types of coffee, and this one rates right up there...you will not be disappointed."
4,"I purchased these coffee beans via a SEARCH on the AMAZON site, looking for beans that I can roast myself (have done this for the past 5 years). I intended these to be GREEN (unroasted) coffee beans for my own roasting (but ""GREEN"" is in this product's title). When the already-roasted beans arrived, I notified AMAZON of the error. Foods cannot be returned; therefore, I simply received a credit.<br /><br />Although this roast is not as smooth as many of the beans I have roasted over the years, the taste is good enough for 4-stars.  I appreciated AMAZON for refunding my purchase while my family savors this commercial roast (on the house)."
4,"One of my cats had dental work done, and I'm trying to avoid needing to do that again.  She loves her ""treats"" (oral hygiene chews); I hope they do help keep her teeth clean."
4,"This is a solid tea, a good addition to a rotation of teas.  Good taste."
4,"My cats love it.  It is a bit overpriced though.  And I don't like the epackaging claim that it is made of rice paper.  Now, that sounds all so nice and eco friendly, but the truth is, it is plastic.  Perhaps the outer packaging is layered with rice paper for effect.  This doesn't change the fact that I am stuck with plastic packaging that is not biodegradable, and possible leaching of chemicals into the product.  Nonetheless, I concede convenience of plastic packaging and some inevitability of its use, especially in shipping.  Just, let's not make a misleading claim to give off a wrong impression."
4,"These are very yummy noodles!  Like ramen noodles in texture, but without a soup base.  They contain a vegetable I've never heard of before, called moroheiya, touted on the package to be ""...highly nutritious""...prized by the Egyptians for its health and beauty benefits.""  Don't know how it ended up in a Japanese noodle product but I'm glad it did since it's very delicious, vegan and the 20 moroheiya leaves the package says it contains are organically grown.  (Would have given it 5 stars if the entire product were organically grown.)  Because there's no soup base, I've been using them in a variety of dishes - including soup.  Love them with scrambled tofu and vegetables!  Excellent product."
4,"I tried the Clear Scalp&Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Shampoo through the Amazon Vine program, and I am pleased that I did.  I usually use a brand of thickening shampoo for color treated hair, and the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Shampoo was quite different.  My hair and scalp felt really clean after one shampoo.  Because my hair has thinned a lot over the years, I use a lot of products on my hair and I mean a lot!  On a daily basis I use root lifter, keratin fiber powder and spray, as well, as hair spray.  Every time I shampoo I also use a conditioner and a volume booster, and I use a hair masque weekly.  With all this ""gunk"" on my hair and scalp, sometimes my regular shampoo has trouble getting my hair clean and I have to shampoo twice.  I was pleased to discover that the Clear Scalp&Hair Beauty did a great job of cleaning my hair and scalp, and I only had to apply the shampoo once.  I gave this shampoo 4 stars, because I don't think I will use it on a regular basis as I'm afraid it might be a little too much for the little hair I have left.  I will continue to use this shampoo on a ""weekly-ish"" basis to clear my hair and scalp of all the products that I use, and let it ""breathe.""  For anyone who occasionally uses a clarifying shampoo in place of her/his regular shampoo the Clear Scalp&Hair Beauty shampoo is definitely one to try."
4,"I like these jerky spices because it makes it easy to turn lean ground beef (or other lean ground meat) into jerky that my family loves and is much more economical than buying jerky anywhere.  I prefer the original to the other flavors so I can ""doctor it up"" to my taste.  This has been a hit with family, friends, and when my husband talks to people about the jerky I make, you would think that it's a securely guarded multi-generational family recipe.  *LOL*"
4,"My one year old has loved these since she first started crawling, they're perfect for on the go snacks.  The only problem is the packaging.  The puffs get stale quickly and the lid on the container pops open easily, so I've had them spill all over my diaper bag and the floor.  So I had to tape the lid shut, and eventually transferred them to another container.  But the puffs themselves are great, if she likes them who cares if they taste like nothing to me!"
4,"This is a nice white chocolate bar with crunchy hazelnuts by Ritter. I love their chocolate covered biscuits and this is a fine piece of candy.<br /><br />I do think it needs something more. I'd like a biscuit or some other type of flavor to offset the waxiness of white chocolate. Hazelnuts are good, but this product would be better with a biscuity crunch or rice cereal to give it a bit of oomph."
4,"It's been a long time since I've had real Rice Krispies but these seem to taste pretty much the same. I haven't tried to make Rice Krispie treats or anything with them yet, just having bowls of cereal"
4,"I used these for the candy buffet I had at my wedding and I must say these were literally bursting with orange flavor. I usually find gum balls to be pretty bland no matter the flavor. These were very hard to me and hurt my teeth a little bit, so it lost a star, but I would recommend them based on the flavor alone. They looked great for the autumn themed candy buffet we had going on."
4,"I am getting serious headaches from using this product. I know it is supposed to help with migraines but it seems to be having the opposite affect on me. I took 2 teaspoons yesterday and i got a raging headache. Is this too much for the first time? i've been using Mag supplements for years and thought my body would be used to it. Any suggestions or recommendations i would surely love to hear them<br /><br />I still gave this product 4 stars because i think it is great and has huge potential. Like i said i've taken several high quality mag supplements for years and none of them stopped leg cramps and muscle spasms, eye twitches so quickly.It did give me better sleep but not the best but i'm sure that comes with time. The pills i was taking were big horse pills and i didn't take them alot because of the size. I am taking this because of my Vitamin D deficiency that i just can't seem shake, although it's only been 7 months. You have to have Magnesium for Vitamin D to absorb properly. This does loosen your stools some, but i've never had a problem in that area, thank goodness.<br /><br />I am open to suggestions about the dosage. I will wait a few days and maybe start with 1/2 teaspoon ans see how that goes."
4,"These are pretty tart, but they got me through an overseas trip when I could eat nothing else on the airplane (the food was not gluten free). Interesting crunchy texture! I'd order again."
4,"Okay, I jumped the gun, because they were sending me the review information, before I received my chips, so I thought I would be honest, and indicate that I have not received them, and I wasn't happy about not receiving them. However overall, the service is not bad, and my chips are on the way.Sorry guys, they really are not bad people, I am just an impatient buyer... there, is that better?"
4,"I eat them mashed on buttered toast with fresh black pepper. These are small/medium fish, 5 or 6 per tin with skin and backbones. They are a little more tender than other fish. Lots of tomato sauce, but very lightly salted so that their taste is very delicate. The flavors of the tomato and fish are nicely balanced. These water-packed fish don't have a lot of the punch of some of their saltier, oil-packed cousins, which can leave my tongue wanting a bit more, but overall these are great fish."
4,"10lbs of almonds arrived promptly in nice resealable 1lb bags.  Quality is better than what is available at BJs where I used to get them with the added convenience of being shipped to my door with no yearly membership fee. :)  Good price/quality/convenience and will buy another 10lbs after we are done enjoying these."
4,"Ok, can I just express how much my dog loves Greenies.  I know that there have been reports of problems with dogs inhaling them without chewing them well and thus having digestion problems, but my dog savors them.  She freaks out when she knows she's going to get one and will heard whomever is getting it right to the place we store them.  She knows if we talk about them so we have to call them G's to each other.  She will tolerate other treats if I'm waiting for an order from Amazon, but she doesn't like it.  The only downfall is the price.  I can usually find a pretty good deal somewhere on Amazon and so I'll stock up on them when I can.  If I can't, she has to wait and substitute with something else."
4,"Very Price competitive with Health Food Stores when purchased via AMAZON...<br />Another good Gluten Free item..."
4,"The ingredients are far better than most leading brands of cat food you see at the supermarket. My cats are very picky with dry food and they like the taste of this food."
4,"When I get bored with ice tea and coffee, I will usually opt for a fruit flavored powdered mix packet that I add to ice water. Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink Fruit Punch isn't overly sweet & is similar in flavor to the powdered drinks, but  also contains added vitamins, minerals & caffeine.  However, I have a hard time getting the correct amount without measuring it.  The serving/squeeze  equals one tbsp  or 3 tsp  for 8oz of water.<br /><br />Each serving of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink provides vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, B12, Chromium, Zinc, Taurine, Electrolytes & 40 mg of caffeine. I felt a slight energy boost when I drank a couple servings during my midday slump.<br /><br />For best quality refrigerate & use within 30 days after opening. Shake well before each use."
4,"This is pretty good. Less calories than most cereals, and easy enough to eat without needing a bowl and milk. Instead of Grape-nuts type tiny bits, the Kind brand has good chunks of granola clusters that I can grab and eat.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good sized chunks<br />- Not a lot of calories for a serving<br />- Excellent variety of grains and a good, whole flavor<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Blueberry? Eh, didn't taste it, and didn't see it. -1 star for lack of blueberry goodness."
4,"They look like puffy Cheerios covered in tiny bits of crushed peanuts and they definitely have the taste of roasted peanuts with a bit of sweetness.  They stayed crunchy till the very bottom of the bowl, so the cereal seems to live up to its name of Crunchy Nut Roasted nut and Honey.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a pretty satisfying cereal.  If you like the taste of roasted peanuts, I think this is a pretty good choice.  Just like Cheerios, they taste pretty good both with and without milk so they make a pretty good snack on the good too."
4,"Quaker Oatmeal Squares<br /><br />I like to eat these right out of the box, as a snack.  They would be perfect if they had fewer carbohydrates.<br />I recommend them.<br />Gunner.  June, 2012"
4,"Good for the money. Not too fishy or salty. thicker than other brands. Deeper flavor in broths, woks, and in mixing."
4,"I made this popcorn with my genuine Whirley-Pop popcorn maker (which I like!)---it popped perfectly, however, I noticed the kernals were smaller (than microwave popcorn kernals).  But it was good!"
4,"This is a great strong flavored coffee without bitterness.  It keeps well in the thermos too!  Enjoy"
4,"Used to use another brand (that changed), in a jar, but this is so much better!  Has a very pleasing spicy taste with a hint of lemon/lime and a fair amount of heat.  It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to ""spice it up"".  We wish it had a lower sodium content.  While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing!  Really good with shrimp, imitation crab/lobster, chicken, beef, pork and veggie dishes.  Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals.  We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it.  Will buy again!"
4,"I bought this item based on the good reviews it got and for the price. I think this is a product that is more useful in baking than a hot tea - it seems to require a lot of careful mixing that is too much hassle for a quick cuppa. It was green and not brown like one of the reviews here stated. I just bought an ice cream maker and am planning to use it for that or just to add to my morning smoothie for a boost. I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!"
4,"My husband absolutely loves these and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for such a great price. However, the product pictured is a bag, but mine arrived in 3 boxes of 10 packets each.  Not a bad thing, just different from what is pictured/described. I deducted one star though, because I'd prefer if one packet made more."
4,"I've mostly used this product to catch random spiders in our basement and have been amazed at the results. Rarely see any spiders or cobwebs around our house, but these traps catch all sorts of spiders.  Works great for them, and other random bugs"
4,"A&B coconut  juice was very refreshing.  I though it would be a little sweeter, but it was very good.  I'd probably buy it again if the price was a little lower."
4,"I have a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier.  She has chewed me out of house and home (literally).  She chewed a huge hole in my kitchen floor, all the way thru to the crawlspace, then proceeded to chew thru the back door (yep you guessed it... she succeeded).  Anyway, stuffed toys are a joke to her.  They last all of 2 minutes, no matter how ""tuff"" they claim to be.  She generally has no interest in the rubber ""Kong"" types, so I was skeptical about this Everlasting Toy.  Boy was I wrong.  She is completely addicted. She carries it everywhere.  The disk treat inside lasted about a day.  She had more fun licking it than trying to get it out of the toy.  She finally licked it down so far that it pretty much came out on it's own.  I stuffed little treats in the other side.  She could not put it down.  After going at it a full day, she finally got it empty.  I inspected it at that point.  Not a single puncture or tear.  This thing is amazing.  It was a little pricey at Petsmart.  I'll get the refills here.  Definately worth the $$.  She's about 18 lbs, so I got the medium size.  Perfect fit.<br />*** CON:  The Chicken flavor disks do smell a little yucky.  And, after awhile of constant licking, they also get a little slimey.  I would suggest keeping it off the furniture."
4,"On a scale of 0 to 10:<br /><br />Health: 7 - The main ingredient is the standard flour, followed then by the 7 whole grains, so this can't be considered a true whole grain cracker.  The positives are that there are no hydrogenated oils and the limited sweetener is evaporated cane juice.<br /><br />Taste: 9 - Excellent taste<br /><br />Price: 4 - If you can find this for $2, it's a bargain.  Generally, it's closer to $3, which is a little high for a 9 OZ box of crackers."
4,"We have two cats, both of whom can be finicky eaters. One cat is a ""people food"" lover; he will eat almost anything that we eat (turkey is his favorite).  The first time we introduced this food to him, he lapped it up.  The other cat does not touch ""people food"" at all.  He took one sniff of this food and turned on his heels.  We tried all flavors and he wouldn't eat any of them.<br /><br />So, if you have a cat who loves ""people food"", Petite Cuisine will probably satisfy him.  This cat food is of high quality with no ""by-products"" and comes in single serving pop-top cans.  Highly recommended for cats that are open to new flavors but may not be for those that prefer to stick with what they know."
4,"There were no cooking directions included. I put 1 1/2 cups of rice in 6 cups of water. Let it boil for 10 minutes then drained in a strainer. It came out fluffy and was not sticky at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is even after cooking the burlap smell from the bag the rice comes in is still distinct. It does go away after a few minutes and there is no after taste to the rice. My family loves the rice and it cooks up faster than other brands."
4,"Another favorite treat my dogs love.  It is not organic - so I can't give it a 5 star rating - but I am hoping the duck is from a reliable source of humanely farmed U.S fowl.  I care about my dogs health, but I also care about the animals that are the source of protein for my dogs."
4,"My husband has to watch his sugar intake so I've begun doing the same.  So far most of the sugar free candies, cookies, ice creams are pretty good.  The best is the Pillsbury Sugar Free brownie mix.  Anyway, these aren't very sweet but they do taste good."
4,"One of the things that I missed the most when I went gluten-free was a good, spicy molasses cookie.  This offering from Nana's definitely fits the bill.  I took off one star simply because it is pricey.  On the plus side, the cookies are quite big and it is nice to have an option for vegan treats.  I have tried to make gluten-free cookies of my own and have failed miserably because I try to make them healthy.  I appreciate Amazon for offering these because the company offers low prices, free shipping, and excellent customer service."
4,"We use this for a breakfast drink to start the day. Mix a heaping scoopful with 1/2 Cup of milk, 1/2 Cup of plain fat-free yogurt, and a banana or other fruit, throw in the blender. Yummy."
4,"When I was a kid my older brother gave me this hot sauce from one of his trips.  He wanted me to taste it, so I did.  On a side note I was really brave about it.  And let me tell you it was HOT!  Hotter than you can ever imagine!  Just a couple drops and your mouth will feel the scorching heat like a devil raising hell.  They're not kidding when they really call it Hot Sauce From Hell: Devil's Revenge.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce like me, this one for you.  But be warned: Don't feed it to those that can't handle the heat like your mother or your pets or the elderly.  It might choke on the heat and maybe die of it."
4,"Very tasty!<br /><br />I'm not much into peanut butter but I thought these cookies are actually pretty good. Personally I didn't think the peanut butter was over-powering, thought the mix of flavors was about right.<br /><br />My wife just loves these. Two of her favorit flavors are together in one cookie. She absolutely decimated the package in a very short time.<br /><br />A coworker of mine didn't care for these too much. He seemed to think that the chocolate tasted like Hershey's which he doesn't like. For me though I happen to like Hershey's. Maybe that's why I like the way these taste."
4,"Like the title says, my dog really loves these! He's a big chewer but these keep him interested enoough to not chew on things he shouldn't. These are also completely affordable and last my dog a long time. I find that all bully sticks have a smell, but compared to ones I've bought before these aren't bad at all.<br /><br />(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.  However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
4,"Really good popcorn, shipping costs as much as the popcorn. Don't know if it is worth it."
4,"If you like a big cup of coffee, buy the ""extra"" and/or ""dark"" cups.  They contain more coffee for the same approximate price as the non-extra cups (as the packaging is the expense in K-cups).<br /><br />I make 14 ounces of coffee from these Extra-Bold Dark Magic Decaf cups, then add two ounces of milk.  (Of course, if you like strong coffee, you'll need to make the usual 8 ounces.)<br /><br />Note: Be careful when ordering decaf coffee from Amazon: Amazon has a big fat bug in their search algorithm:  If you search for decaf, they will happily serve up regular coffee instead. Make sure before you click the Buy button that you really are buying decaf.  Otherwise, you may be awake for the next 40 days and 40 nights."
4,"I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?"
4,"The Quaker Cookie, was a great soft cookie to eat. My 3 years old daughter really enjoyed the treat! It was soft, there wasn't any after taste to the cookie.. Just all the yummy goodness.. We tried the Oatmeal raisin cookie and the raisin's were good, they were soft not hard..  Overall I would definitely would buy the Quaker Cookies again.. and would definitely buy another kind other than raisin as well.. I think YOU should try it out. :)"
4,"There is only so much grilled chicken with spices you can endure before you start losing your mind and your will to keep dieting. This sauce suprised me on its flavor. It was nice and smokey and sweet. It is thin, but, do you want that many chemicals in your food to make it thick? Great change of pace!"
4,"The individual chocholate squares are bigger than I thought, about an inch in length on each side. These chololates are good, I would purchase them again."
4,"I received this as a gift and think it is a wonderful plant. Much better than cut flowers that will die off in a week. My bonsai arrived in really good condition with no broken branches and green leaves. It doesnt have any flowers or buds but I am hoping with a little love and care it may eventually get some Gardenias."
4,"I used to drink this tea daily, years ago, and both my local health food stores stopped stocking it.  They started carrying something a bit different, from this same company, so I just assumed they were no longer making it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and at a wonderful price as well.  I recommend this to any woman who suffers from PMS symptoms---mine are moderate to sometimes severe and I see a huge improvement when I drink it.  God provides.  It's heartening that there's a healthy alternative to prescription drugs, Midol, and birth control pills.  PMS is NOT 'all in your head' and this product is NOT 'a placebo effect'--I've seen both things recently written and it infuriates me.  You really have nothing to lose except your PMS symptoms, by trying this tea. I believe you can even order this by the box, if you don't want to buy the case.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it carries a warning for people who have liver problems---so if you do, I guess stay away from this product.  Otherwise, try it and see if it works for you."
4,"We were pleased to find this product. We had gotten it at a restaurant in the past but they went out of business. Only problem is one of the caps was broken when we received it, allowing the product to leak a little. This made us unsure if it was safe to use."
4,"They are astronomically expensive (check out the ""regular"" prices) but they are quality and delicious. There probably is equal to and cheaper out there but it is nice as a splurge and they are delivered to you so you don't need to go in search of good beef. Every piece is guaranteed to be yummy, no guess work involved."
4,"This is a remarkable product.  An amazingly long expiration date for a preservative free food, a great cheezy flavor, and you should not fear to buy this product in bulk, especially if you really enjoy it."
4,"The first pleasant surprise of this the new Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers is that the packaging is truly ingenious--it is a pasta cooker, pasta drainer, and serving dish all in one.  With the Ziti and Meat Sauce, you simply remove the lid, add water to fill line, replace lid, pop in microwave for 3 1/2 minutes, drain the pasta right in the container (the lid is a pasta drainer), heat the sauce (which comes in a separate container within the same package) for 30 seconds, pour sauce over drained pasta and eat!  I will admit that the packaging gave me a few moments of confusion at first--you have to remove a film from the top of the pasta drainer and remove a ""security"" ring of plastic around the package before you can remove the lid--but once I had done it one time, it was a piece of cake.<br /><br />The second pleasant surprise is how GREAT the product tastes!  I was amazed that something that can be prepared in 4 minutes could be so good.  I know some people think ""Eh, it's called Healthy Choice; it must be diet food, so it probably tastes nasty.""  NOPE!  I've dieted much of my life and I've eaten some NASTY diet products, but this ain't that!  Just one note on taste though--the sauce is quite ""zesty,"" which I loved because I cook with a lot of pepper and herbs because I'm hypertensive and can't use much salt, but if you don't like spicy food or spicy food bothers your tummy, you may want to just try one before you buy a whole bunch of them.<br /><br />And, on top of all that, the meal is filling, too!  I have eaten many prepared meals in the ""healthy"" category where I felt like I needed to eat another meal after I finished the product--it just wasn't enough food to make me feel satisfied!  But I haven't felt like that with this product.  Granted, I do eat a piece of crusty bread with the product (because I love eating crusty bread with pasta) and that helps me feel fuller, but I was very pleasantly surprised that this meal is really a meal and not just an appetizer masquerading as a meal!<br /><br />As a person who brought her lunch to work every day, I can only wish that these Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers had been around before I retired earlier this year!"
4,"But this is still pretty darn good.  Senseo is my favorite way to start the day!"
4,"Our two large dogs really like this product. They gobbled it down and wanted more. Since they are on the chunky side, we try to limit their food intake a bit. This dog food satisfied them and gave them a meal which they really appeared to enjoy."
4,"Got these for my dad for Father's Day and he liked them a lot. His eyes were watering, but he likes that kind of spicy."
4,"If your intent on purchasing this variety pack is to get the exact flavors listed in the possible selections, you will not be happy.  However, if your intent is to try a variety of different coffee flavors to see what is available what you like, you'll love this sample selection.  Others have complained about it coming in a brown paper bag... who cares!!!!  It's a great value for a nice selection and a great price. Go for it!"
4,"I have been looking for an automatic espresso machine for the longest time to no avail. This one meets all my requirements. The only negative point is the water tank that is a bit too small. Otherwise, super!!!"
4,"I was expecting 12 bags at 6 oz each.  I got one big plastic bag with all the candy in it."
4,"Very convenient and well-priced.<br /><br />Two problems:<br /><br />1. Shipment notice now arrives too late to modify the current month's order. It should be sent earlier.<br /><br />2. Prices seem to change without prior notice."
4,"My Japanese friend introduced me to this and I was instantly hooked! GREAT aroma and taste and SO easy to make. Simply throw some rice into your rice cooker, boil this pre-made curry sauce (with veggies) in boiling water and soon as the rice is done, cut open the packet and pour over your rice! Love this stuff. If you would rather use fresh veggies (even though the carrots and potatoes included in this packet are pretty good for pre-packaged veggies), you can simply purchase just the solid-type (bouillon) curry mix by S&B and it works the same. Then just throw in your own meat and veggies and it comes out just as good.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

4,"If I use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes. A lot of the time shampoo will make my hair feel very oily too. I am very selective about what type of shampoo that I use since many of them do not agree with my hair and scalp.<br /><br />I typically use an Anti-Dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half. This shampoo has a nice scent but not over-powering and it lathers very well. It's also a thinner consistency than most shampoo.<br /><br />There are two things about this shampoo that make it really good. First of all it has twice the Pyrithione Zinc as many Anti-Dandruff shampoos which makes it very effective. It also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it very soft and manageable. As long as they keep the price competitive then this will be a popular choice for me."
4,"this was a great product at a great price, i would recommend it to everyone that uses the kcups. its a great product"
4,"item was delivered in a timely manor, and the price was not that bad along with the shipping.<br />i really like these as they are very thin compared to the ones i get in the grocery store.<br />only thing i did not like is they do not have enough salt on them. there was a pretzel out there called<br />mr. salty which was real good but no longer made. wish the store in my area would handle these so i would not have to buy a whole case."
4,"I have tried many gluten free foods and I like this one.  It does stick in your teeth but I don't find that to be a problem. S. Hester"
4,"I had some problems with packaging and unlike the picture this product comes in one large box inside a blue food grade plastic bag. Mine was not twist tied or sealed in any fashion and the nut oils had penetrated through to the outside of the box. Aside from that issue the nuts themselves were of a perfect size for baking.They are nice light nut meats and are of a very good quality. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that my case was not sealed properly and could have led to possible contamination as well as oxidation and rancidity issues."
4,"Fine powder, great when added to Whey smoothie. Gonna try in cookies at Christmas.  when mixed with water in a little bowl tasted salty to me but I eat very little salt.  I'm sure I will find more uses but so far the best yet was in the smoothie.<br /><br />Also I am a person who loves to eat any nut butter right out of the jar but have to resist because of the calories so I have high expectations of flavor and texture. This hits the peanut butter spot, but there is no danger for me of over indulging :)"
4,"My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them."
4,"We recently started baking our own bread and this yeast has been perfect. It rises consistantly every time and has held up great being frozen."
4,"I have ordered these on numerous occasions because the kids love them.  The sticks are a little small, but they allow you to eat four (serving size 4 pieces) with 160 calories.  The fat is a different matter - 1g of trans fat and 6g of saturated fat - 14 total grams of fat per serving.  Obviously not a great health choice if you are going to go through the box in one sitting.  That having been said, they taste great and sometimes are the only thing that hits the spot when you are craving a salty meaty snack.  We throw one in to our youngest kid's lunch box and it makes her day."
4,"I love this full flavored tea any time, but you really need to like hibiscus to enjoy it. It can taste a bit sharp sometimes if you over-steep it."
4,"I purchased 3 of the Victor mole traps and followed the instructions and caught a mole the first time I set them. I was amazed at the ease of setting and how simple they are to use. We have clay loam soil and they work very well in moist soil, or sandy soil."
4,"I really liked this snack bar combination of peanuts and peanut butter.  It is made up of a thin bottom layer of peanut butter topped with just peanuts that does not become too gooey or sweet. There are 5 bars to a box and it comes out to around $14/box which is a bit expensive (I deducted a star for value) but peanuts are the first ingredient.  I would rather pay more money for these then have my kids (and myself) eat a peanut bar where peanuts are listed as the third or fourth ingredient.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the health snack bars and this one is a good substitute for me.  It's not exactly a diet snack but it's better then the other options I usually go to when I am feeling peckish.  Here are some of the key nutrional facts:<br /><br />calories - 220<br />daily value saturated fat - 20%<br />daily value protein - 7%<br />daily value fiber - 12%"
4,"Last year I purchased Gimbal's Fine Candies Sugar Free Black Licorice Chews in the 10 pound case TWICE.  The cost with free shipping was $46.00.  Now it is almost DOUBLED in price.  Ridiculous and Outrageous. I like the item but its pricing is a rip off. Are they getting the materials to manufacture this from oil rich countries?"
4,"I love this creamer in my coffee.  However, reviewers are correct about the pump, and many many reviewers comment on its poor quality.  I can't imagine why the folks at the company don't get the hint.  Executives...what do you have to do to make them come to their senses?  Anyway, it will work for a while, but soon stops pumping all together.  It just gets gradually harder and harder to push the pump down, until you are leaning all your weight on it just to get the pump to depress.  I finally sawed through the top with a serrated knife and poured it into an empty water bottle so I can easily unscrew it and use.  I plan to buy a nice (empty) soap dispenser to pour the creamer into, and use it that way.  The above reviewers advice to freeze the extra creamer is a good tip that I will use.  I will just thaw it out when I need to refill the dispenser!"
4,"When I really want to give my dogs a treat, I buy Beneful and they do a dance. They eat it like it's dessert, and it certainly seems to do everything that a dog food should. Their health stays good, their eyes bright and their coats dense and shiny. It even smells like something nice and not some kind of old dog-foody smell. I know they say that there are all kinds of good things in there, but mostly, I look at my dogs."
4,"I am not that thrilled with the taste, but when I add to my 32 ounce water bottle its a nice subtle flavor- I used to have to have a cup of coffee in the evening to get me through work ( I work nights ) but this seems to pep me up, and keep me awake without the shaky feeling- Interested to try other flavors, this is just ok tasting :)"
4,"It took some experimentation, but much like Keith from NYC, I got my own system down and they work just fine. And all that Illy I bought is not going to waste. I bought it when I was using my Delonghi EC155 - but it went belly up and since it was my second one of the same machine, I bought my Citiz w/ Milk because Ethical had just come out with their capsules (those work fine for me and I like the Cremosa) and I thought I'd give these Ne-caps a shot. (pun intended) So, after watching the videos and trying various ways of tamping, I pretty much gave the tamping up, too, much like Keith did. I have a small coffee spoon, I fill the capsule to over flowing give a light tamp with the back of the spoon, and scrape off the excess with the handle. I do five in the morning (or the night before) for the 3-5 espressos I'll drink throughout the day. From pulling the coffee out to sealing the capsules and putting the coffee away takes less than 2 minutes - and the espresso using my Illy is just great! Every once in awhile I'll have one that does the dribble thing, but hardly ever now that I have my system down. I use them with the little rings for the newer machines. How someone can say that they don't work in their machines is beyond me, I don't think they tried them or they didn't use the ring or they over tamped the capsules.<br /><br />As to cost, yes, each capsule is 20 cents empty, but the Nespresso capsules just jumped up a little over 5% to 60 cents a capsule plus shipping. My espresso needs would be cost prohibitive if I used Nespresso exclusively. I do plan on buying some of the lungo capsules in decaf for my few friends who don't do caffeine, but since I've never had any other than the sample capsules of Nespresso I'm not missing anything and really, it's Illy in my ne-caps...Illy (and the Lavazza when I run out of that) (I may have a problem)"
4,"The price on these fell to a $1, so I bought 20 of them.  I'm pretty sure they lost money on that deal.  I was raised the next day.  Anyway, the product is great.  Dogs love them.  But I'm pretty sure they'd love stale popcorn too.. hmmm.."
4,"I love this mustard. It has a kick that goes well with almost any sandwich. My only complaint is that I wish instead coming in six tiny bottles that it came in 2 regular size bottles. It is a pain to get that last little bit out of the jar."
4,"These are so good. I never buy the chocolate oreos anymore. I always buy these when i feening for oreos. I'm a vanilla cookie eater more than a a chocolate one, and these are one of the best vanilla sandwich cookies out there."
4,"I drink a 5 hour energy 2-3 times per week when I need the boost to make it to the end of the day and sometimes to get my day started.  I like the 5-hour energy over coffee.  Coffee tends to let me crash and the 5 hour does not."
4,"Earl Grey tea is my wifes favorite!  Very simple to make with the k cup machine and add some honey for a little bit sweeter tea.  Only complaint is price."
4,"I am a huge Spice Islands fan.  I hate that so few grocery store chains carry their wonderful quality products any more.<br /><br />This lemon peel is handy to have on hand, it's lovely on vegetables and in cakes and cookies and in scones.  Also good as a seasoning if you are trying to reduce your salt intake."
4,"This is good peppermint tea that I don't think you can go wrong with. That said, it's also not something to write home about.  If it seems like a good deal, I would recommend purchasing it however I didn't notice much difference between this brand and other brands of peppermint tea so I wouldn't recommend you necessarily spend more on this brand."
4,"We have a cat with a liver problem who needs a low-purine diet.  As a result, we are trying to switch her off of her Wellness food and find poultry alternatives that do not contain any organ meat.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the site are accurate except that they exclude ""chicken liver"" as the second ingredient in the chicken and brown rice food and ""turkey liver"" as the second ingredient in the turkey and vegetable food.  Thus, I just bought two cases of food that will not meet my cat's needs at all!<br /><br />Other than that, it seems to be a high quality food.  It is a pate-style food with a meaty, but not unpleasant odor.  Cats ate it right away when offered.  Will be donating ours to the local animal shelter, where I am sure it will be loved!"
4,"This is good because it doesn't have sugar or sweetner and I can add my own in the amount I want. There is a lot for the price,"
4,"For those who have never tried Popchips before, they are not exactly a normal potato chip.  Popchips are air popped rather than fried.  They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just ""different"" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety."
4,"These are great if you like a little spice to your noodles.  The product overall is not quite enough for a lunch, it would be nice if there were a little more to the meal.  The issue I have is in preparation.  I have made many of these, and almost every time I am sure to prepare it exactly as instructed and each time the water ends up boiling over the side, making a mess of the seasoning all along the edge of the bowl and leaving the liquid in the bottom of the microwave for cleanup.  They are good enough that I don't mind the cleanup, but, you would think they would package it a little differently so there wouldn't be issues.  I have tried a little less water, which usually helps, but it leaves the noodles a little dry.  Regardless, I would recommend these, just put a few paper towels under the package when microwaving."
4,"The only thing keeping this product from five stars are all of the broken shells. At the top of the bag, I found a number of half shells. However, when I got to the bottom I realized that many of the seeds had collected there in a pile of shell remnants and seasoning salt. Blow the seasoning off and you may lose some seeds as well. Otherwise, a great eating experience."
4,"This herbal tea is well balanced and pleasant.  It tastes to me like good real lemon, but not acidic.  The ginger seems just enough.  Bonus; you can use the bag twice and get a good cup of tea the second time.  Also, it's nice to steep this with black tea, and get a bit of caffeine if you choose, along with the ginger / lemon flavors."
4,"This is a black tea with cardamon, cloves and cinnamon and ginger. As a ""chai"" tea, it's, well, not exactly true Indian Chai, which in addition to those sweet spices, has black pepper and is prepared by stewing the tea along with spices into an evaporated milk and water mix in a pot on the stove. How do I know? I have a friend overseas, a Sikh from Thailand, and he has his assistants make it in a little kitchen behind his office and that's how they do it. Chai masala, CTC black Assam tea, raw sugar and evaporated milk. And it's so delicious, served in little glasses and it cools you on a hot day by making you sweat.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke tea, however, has the spice mixed in the tea bag, and no black pepper, which personally, I find is the best part of chai. But it's convenient and it makes a nice pot of tea, rather reminiscent of Bigelow's famous ""Constant Comment"" except it has no orange peel. The bags come in individual envelopes, so it's nice for serving in an office setting or at home to guests if they want to brew a mug on their own. It's pretty nice iced, and you can throw in slices of oranges for a real treat, or add some fruit juice (apple is nice) diluted fifty-fifty for a sort of summer punch that is slightly sweet but not cloying. But don't expect ""pulled tea"" or Indian Chai. For that, go get a box of chai-masala and follow the directions."
4,"I'm a big fan of the higher end blancos, served chilled with lime, no salt.  However, this blanco was so amazing there was no need for lime, and it would be a shame to use this to make a mixed drink.  I recently compared this to DeLeon's Diamante ($100 for the same amount of tequila) and I'd say that even the DeLeon still could benefit from a little lime, and could possibly improve a mixed drink, but I would sip Corzo Silver by itself any day.  It has just enough flavor and is very smooth.  Highly recommended."
4,"My wife doesn't like chocolate, but she likes granola. I love chocolate and I'm fine with granola. Here's a granola snack we can agree on. She tasted it and pronounced it ""pretty good."" I'm a big fan of chocolate bars with add-ins, like bacon or fruit or chili, so chocolate with berries is right up my alley. I like it, and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat it. Now if I can just get our 5-year-old to try some, I can share the whole family's opinion."
4,"These bars are a real treat if you like the taste of sesame. Most of the bar is soft and crumblie in texture however in some places a little hard.  They are nutritional and great for an on the go supplement."
4,"I found these snacks on a jetblue flight and since then they have been my primary snacking chip. They are have pretty much healthy snacks for you because their is nothing bad in them. It is quite amazing and they are even gluten free for people that need good snacks like that.<br /><br />The most important part is they are delicious. I can't quite describe them, but they beat anything else out there. They also solved my old Doritos problem where the chips would slice the roof of my mouth......"
4,"We were looking for a pure whey protein without any ""junk"" added.  This product fits the bill exactly.  It's great for post-workout shakes.  We are very pleased and would highly recommend this product."
4,"These spoons arrived in the mail, unbroken, right in time for a cocktail party I was throwing. They were tasty, on time, and in one piece, but the handle was very short (only about an inch). They are sort of an odd design, all spoon and very little handle, but they work well and would taste good with either sweet or savory fillings."
4,"Excellent product. Remember to soak the sticky rice for at least 4-5 hours. The product could have been purchased through the seller at a cheaper price, but I like Amazon because I could always track my purchases easier."
4,"We love Happy Tots food. My 12 month old has tried many varieties and loves them all. He has not had one sour face yet! I'm surprised at the price here, you can get this item at Target for $1.09 per pouch which is much less expensive. I guess buying it online is helpful for people who don't have access to a Target or Health food store, and in that case, is worth the price.<br /><br />*** as a special precaution ***<br /><br />A baby food recall just issued by the FDA (Jan. 2010) may have some of the most stomach-churning details I've read in awhile:<br /><br />""Swollen or leaking pouches may indicate problems with the product, including possible contamination by bacteria that can cause illness, or that the packaging has been compromised and is at risk of bacterial contamination.""<br /><br />The recalled food is made by Happy Baby, and it's a mix of the baby and toddler lines that parents should be throwing out.

4,"I really like this flavor of the ExtendBar. First time I have tried them. I eat 1/2 of the bar before bedtime and my sugars are great in the morning. Definitely recommend this product."
4,"I love orange juice. I could drink it almost 24/7 & it's what I usually prefer if I need to wake up. I'd held off from purchasing the CL `Sunrise' because I really didn't know if I'd like it or not. Orange drink isn't the same as orange juice, so it's usually a hit or miss type of thing & I'm really preferential to the actual juice.<br /><br />So in any case, I finally gave in & purchased a package. Since I work nights, it's not always convenient to go out & purchase bottles of OJ before I go out & I'm not always the greatest at remembering to grab one from the fridge before I leave the house. As with most of the on the go packets, it's easy to remember these.<br /><br />When I was mixing this stuff up, it didn't look appetizing at first. It contains calcium, which made the drink look a little milky at first when I was shaking my water bottle up, which looked strange at first. After a bit more shaking, it looked fine. The flavor is nice & is better than many orange drinks out on the market. CL really does try to capture the OJ flavor as best as they can & they use citric acid in it, which helps considerably.<br /><br />The bonus parts of this drink is that it contains calcium & vitamin C, two things that many people don't get enough of- especially the calcium! (I know I don't.) The only real drawback of this drink is that it didn't look all that great while I was mixing it. The flavor is good for a powdered orange drink. It's not going to replace my lust for the real thing, but it's a good replacement for those days when I can't get some OJ."
4,"Wolfgang Puck definitely has the best coffee for the money.  I absolutely love the French Vanilla.  The KCup actually makes a good full cup of coffee.  it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good.  I still prefer the Senseo Pods to the KCups though."
4,"This black tea is not very strong; it's priced reasonably though.  If you're adding a dash of milk into your black tea, this won't do.  If you're drinking it as is, without milk or sugar; it's quite decent.  Faint aroma, doesn't taste as strong or smell as good as Tazo's Awake.  Nevertheless, pretty good value for what you get."
4,"I have tried every coffee and tea offered for the Tassimo system.  I have found the Maxwell House blends to be some of the better flavored coffees.  The French Roast is taughted as a ""bold"" blend.  It creates a nice rich dark flavor without going into being bitter.  If you are a Starbucks addict; you won't find the ""earthy"" taste in the MH-FR blend, if you're wondering how it compares.  The MH-FR is one of the few Tassimo blends I consistently order.  It makes a very good cup of coffee for any time of the day."
4,"I am a vegetarian that would like to go vegan sometime soon.  I LOVE chocolate and was afraid that vegan chocolate would not be as good as milk chocolate.  After trying soy chocolate ice cream and Amy's chocolate cake, I was very happy that being vegan didn't mean having to give up good chocolate.  I ordered the Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bars because I wanted to try to some more vegan chocolate, and they were pretty good!  The texture is kind of like a brownie, and the chocolaty flavor did not disappoint.  They do have a lot of calories in them for such a small bar (190 a bar), but they also have 7 grams of protein, so that is a plus.  They are also gluten-free!  I would for sure recommend these!"
4,"I bought these to use as a summery treat along with my recently acquired <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023UL86A"">Prodyne Fruit Infusion 93-Ounce Natural Fruit Flavor Pitcher</a>. I was presently surprised with how tasty they were and decided to pop them in my (also newly acquired) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ONQOC"">Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker</a> and they made an AMAZING sorbet/icee-style treat!"
4,"I love chips of all root vegetables-beets, potatoes, parsnips, carrots etc.  I love potato popchips had never tried the sweet potato version. I wasn't sure if the texture of pop chips and the sweet potato flaver would work together.<br /><br />I liked and enjoyed them but they aren't a flavor I would have as my 'go to' snack. I think for sweet potato I prefer real veggie slices.  These are light, crunchy, a little sweet and a little salty and perfect for times when you crave both sweet and salty. They are only 100 calories per bag and they came 24 bags in a nicely packed in a box. Great for lunches, or to keep in the car/desk/purse for a little pick me up snack."
4,"coffie arrived on time,vacuum packed.package in great shape.coffie fresh when opened and taste has a good rich flavor for decalf.I will purchase in future."
4,"Really nice tea with a sweet taste for the sweet tooth after dinner."
4,"These are very fizzy soft drinks, they are quite expensive compared to buying regular American sodas. Though they are very flavorful. I prefer the melon flavor.<br /><br />Recommended for kids, as they get a thrill of opening it.As for adults after you open a few the amusement will go away and it'll become bothersome to open."
4,"My dog didn't like this flavor as much. My dog's favorite moist food is Duck & liver and Duck & Chicken."
4,"I love the marshmallow flavor.  I use this flavor of DaVinci sugar free marshmallow with my hot tea and also to flavor my low carb flax meal muffin in a minute.  I first came across this flavor referenced in Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution Book.  I love Davinci sugar free marshmallow syrup, and I often order it 3 bottles at a time so that I don't run out.  It is a treat, and I'm grateful that it is available through Amazon."
4,"For a store bought cookie, these are good.  Very crunchy and a good flavor.<br /><br />Even if you don't have dietary restrictions, these are worth trying."
4,"These beans are delicious, but why the need for so much salt?  The company should offer a low-salt variety."
4,"Good alternative to the typical baked potatoe chips which are usually filled with other additives like corn and artificial ingredients. They're relatively low fat and taste like the real thing. My only complaint is that they are very salty even thought the manufacturer claims that they are ""lightly salted""."
4,"A little bony but not too bad.. not that lemony to me.  Nice big sardines.  Bargain priced and overall very good."
4,"Somewhat tasty for adults, apparently delicious to children! Kids were happy to have these, so that was the most important to me.<br /><br />Fat free!"
4,"Mi-Del: Slightly cheaper per ounce, crackers are actually animal shaped, butter cookie taste (like those that come in a tin around the holiday season)<br /><br />Envirkidz: Square cookie/cracker, vanilla flavor<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6"">Nature's Path EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Both have similar nutrition profiles (calories, fat, grams of carbohydrate) and are GF.<br /><br />My shipment was not stale, unlike the other reviewer's complaint. Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire."
4,"Add some merlot, a bottle or two, and some fruit, oranges, peaches, apples, pears, marschino cherries, etc, and it makes a delicious lower-cal sangria!"
4,"This is the ideal rack for k-cups. it is especially good if you have limited counter space. Installation is a breeze."
4,"Quick breakdown of the Pros and Cons:<br /><br />Pros<br />- Vegan and Gluten Free (both things I was looking for)<br />- Tastes great<br />- No upset stomach, keeping everything ""moving,"" if you know what I mean...<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not enough to constitute a ""meal replacement"" (only 110 calories per packet)<br />- Expensive<br /><br />I've been drinking Amazon Meal every morning for breakfast for the last two weeks. I mix it up with unsweetened vanilla almond milk (my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064QW0YI"">Original 28oz Blender Bottle Black</a> blends it up wonderfully, but this may not be necessary) and it tastes out-of-this-world. Seriously, I'm usually craving a second one. It has hard gritty/grainy stuff in the powder that gets stuck in your teeth, but otherwise I don't mind the grittiness. My biggest complaint is that this is more of a complement or supplement to a meal, rather than a meal replacement in itself. Lastly, this stuff is *really* expensive; I've looked around on Amazon and found the packets to be the best deal of them all (you would expect the large containers to be... but no). I would definitely recommend this product."
4,"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family."
4,"Love this gum and always like to have on hand in the car, my work bag, and the office.  Wish they just offered one large box for refilling my existing car cups, but this works too!  Better value then buying in most retail stores unless there is a good sale on it."
4,"I am a tea drinker so why not drink a tea that is good for you.  This tea is mild and slightly fragrant.  I am concerned however that this tea came in newer individual packets that look newer then the tea bag itself. I also thought that this tea was a little over priced, since I am able to go to an Asian market and get green tea cheaper."
4,"These Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams are the most tasty crackers we've ever found. I could have eaten the whole box on my own! The flavor was lighter than a traditional graham cracker- less honey/sugary flavor and more cinnamon. The fact these were made with natural ingredients and not fructose, corn syrups, etc. gives these crackers a huge edge over regular grahams.<br /><br />The only thing I can say I didn't care for was the fact these came fairly broken. I think shipping and handling mangled it too much. For this price, they really need to be packaged better so you aren't paying for crumbs."
4,"I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket."
4,"My doggy loves these treats, but cannot find them any longer in the pet store I usually shop in this type of container.  These were rather expensive for the size compared to the ones I bought at the pet store."
4,"I'm not sure what buckwheat is suppose to taste like, a lot of reviews say to be open minded on the taste which confuses me. This cereal tastes like a less sweet version of Frosted Flakes to me. It's really good, perfect amount of crunch. I love the taste, but it's nothing special. I wish it had more of a sweet maple taste. It's kind of bland."
4,"I enjoyed the taste of No Fear, but I can't say that it gave me any more energy than the other energy drinks on the market today.  Since I do, occasionally, indulge in a few energy drinks from time to time, I can say it delivered as much energy as other supplement brands. The four stars were mainly for the taste."
4,"Traditional bouillon is just loaded with salt. In fact, the cheap grocery store bouillon seems nothing more than a flavored salt cubes.<br /><br />This bouillon is quite different, with only 130 mg (5% DV) per serving (serving size is 1/2 a cube). And to be honest with you, I can't imagine wanting it any saltier. These cubes are bursting with great veggie flavor. Also, these are ideal for low-sodium diets and those who try to limit sodium intake.<br /><br />Four stars because, as another reviewer noted, the cubes don't dissolve as easily as other bouillon. You've really got to boil one on the stove top for best results if you want to make a drink out of it. The extra effort really is worth it, though, in the end."
4,"I have been buying this cookies for a long time now, and enjoy them very much.  They taste great - as good as oreo cookies.  LOVE THEM, and will continue to buy them.  I recommend them highly to anyone who must eat Gluten-Free."
4,"Water. Nectar of the gods, falling from clouds, lost in the oceans of our planet, lost in the depths of our own discontent, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBMSB8"">tears in rain</a>.<br /><br />Water.

4,"I got the chunky chocolate chip cookies. They TASTE really good, yummy flavor and the chocolate is great. Like many gluten-free desserts, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. They're very crumbly, many of the cookies didn't even make it to me in one piece, and they'll often fall apart in your hands. Not sure if the other flavors are the same, I have only tried the chocolate chip, but they do taste good enough that I'd try another flavor when I run out of these - which will take a while, I'm the only GF person in the household and six boxes of these plus some Betty Crocker GF mixes and I'm set for a while!<br /><br />I'm fairly new to gluten free baking at home, but I've yet to find many recipes that have very impressive or even edible results. Some aren't bad, but few come anywhere close to the ""real thing."" These might have a bad texture, but they're still very satisfying cookies. No weird tastes from the flours used. The few cookie recipes I've tried at home were absolutely horrible, but if I could choose any GF dessert, I think the (other brand) cake and muffin mixes are better than these for sure. Nice to have around when you don't feel like making your own though. For ready-to-eat GF foods, these are great."
4,"The beans taste good.  I like that the cans are BPA free and that the beans are very low in sodium.  My local supermarket doesn't sell low sodium beans."
4,"This is a quick and easy-to-use covering for oven baked chicken.  We do like it better with a little more spice added like cajun, seasoned salt, or whatever."
4,"I really enjoyed having these portable. portion controlled almond butters. My only negative comment is that they are a bit sweet for me. I didn't know that they contained sugar, so I bought them. I know now that I prefer almond butter without sugar."
4,"The title pretty much says it all. Coconut flavor doesn't pop out in baked goods, but it definitely yields a rich undertone which can't be identified as coconut.  Wonderful in banana bread, cranberry nut bread, pumpkin cake, etc. Price is high, though.  Fair trade, I can understand, but it's real high for the quantity."
4,"Got these for my mom who has book and card clubs galore. When it is her turn to host she and the other ladies enjoy the variety in this sampler pack.<br /><br />They tell me they are all yummy."
4,"This coffee has a nice bold flavor, not too strong, but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful, full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable.  If you like a distinctive, medium bold cup of coffee you will love this."
4,"In my quest for a flavorful Irish Breakfast tea, this one took a close second place to Taylor of Harrogate's Pure Assam.  This is a nice strong hearty wake-you-up brew with good flavors.  It holds up well alone or with a bit of milk or cream.  Pure Assam will be my go-to morning brew, but this one is a bit more available and is also a great choice."
4,"The coffee has a very nice, chocolaty taste, very smooth, but the drawback was the packaging.  It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!"
4,"Just want to share that the Pamela Baking & Pancake Mix is the best I've tried so far. When following the directions, the batter is a little too watery, so I add just a little bit more mix and voila, great pancakes. My husband (who is not gluten free) likes them too."
4,"This coffee is sold as a low acid alternative for those that experience stomach problems from reflux and heartburn. Their research backs up this claim. For those with those issues, I recommend that you give this brand a try. Not only does it work, but it has a great coffee flavor. I also like that it is pre-packaged in 3-oz bags, which is great for taking on trips, and avoids the daily routine of measuring.<br /><br />For me, my morning coffee is something that I truly enjoy and will not compromise on. I'm a Seattle's Best fan and have been drinking their French Roast (now #6) for years, so I was looking forward to trying this French roast and doing a comparison. The first good sign that I noticed is that this is a fine grind, which allows me to use a little less to get the results I like. I used six tablespoons of this coffee to prepare about 7 1/2 cups of coffee, so one 3-oz packet will make a complete pot. It came out just right and tasted very much like the SB. I did not notice any aftertaste or stomach issues.<br /><br />Again, give it a try, especially if you experience stomach problems from regular coffee. If you're concerned about price, enroll in Amazon's subscription service, which affords additional savings and regular delivery."
4,"I have 3 rescue cats who love all 3 flavors of this food. Sometimes they seem to prefer one over the other but between the 3 cats and 3 flavors everything works out. I tried them on the other flavors like turkey and beef but they would usually leave it. I mix a little dry food with these flavors to stretch it out. I also keep plenty of water available because they drink a lot after eating. It must be salty and even though I rated this 4 stars (I like it), the rating is from the cats. I haven't tasted it personally. I was buying this at the grocery store, but since the price in the stores has recently gone up, I'm saving over $12.00/ month on this food using Amazon's subscription service...enough to pay for the 18lb bag of dry food which lasts 2 - 3 months.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B3FIC"">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food, 3-Flavor Seafood Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>"
4,"Moses, my 8 year old cat, was having trouble with itching, dandruff, and excessive earwax accumulating in his ears.  His vet suggested that allergies might be the culprit, so before spending hundreds of dollars on allergy testing, she suggested that I switch him to a premium diet (grain-free, if possible).  Switching from a diet of Fancy Feast (aka Kitty Crack) and Friskies was no easy task! He refused to eat Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and a few other brands of dry food.  For some unknown reason, he's taken a liking to his Wellness Complete Health! It does have a meaty, natural smell and feels slightly oily to the touch.<br /><br />His coat is much shinier, he's dandruff free, and his earwax problem has improved by about 30%.  On the downside, he's gained weight.  My vet said that this food is higher in calories than most other brands, so you'll want to be sure your cat isn't overeating.  Also, I've found that if Moses's diet isn't supplemented with wet food, he gets constipated (which was diagnosed by the tiny balls of poop that stick to his butt or end up around the house).  This was never a problem before he started eating this brand, so beware."
4,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />when you can get this from amazon with free shipping [can't do that right now, unfortunately] it's a dang fine deal. i got the regular flavor and one package is just the right amount to take the edge off my craving. it's really too salty for me to have often, but _wow_ is it good. [*grin*]<br /><br />my big box of 64 packages has lasted me quite some time - since 2010-10 - and it will last a few more weeks. yes, it's past the use-by date. it still tastes fine to me. none of the packs i received were crushed, either.<br /><br />rated a FOUR cuz this item is actually better than i had expected.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
4,"Liked this product, but the serving is too small for the price.  Can't figure out why it's so expensive."
4,"I bought these for my 12 month old son. He loves blueberries so I thought these would be great to have on the go or when we don't have fresh berries to eat. They're a little crunchy then the other kinds they make, and do stain your hands, but they still taste great."
4,"These chips are tasty, crunchy, and best of all, they are reduced in calories and fat.  I think for about half or so of the calories etc of a regular bag of chips you get all of the taste of regular potato chips."
4,"peppered beef steak tastes better than other flavors offered by Jack Links......i actually have only tried the kc bar-b-q. but the other reviews say this flavor tastes the best."
4,"I have been taking this tea for about two weeks now. There is a noticable change in my production. I went to from pumping about 3oz to 5oz. My baby seems satisfied/full when nursing now. I didn't have to supplement with formula at all this week. I also like the taste."
4,"I LOVE Morton's seasoning, have not found any product blend that comes close.  My only caveat is the sodium content.  The bottle is about 70% salt and blended herbs and spices make up the difference.  If salt isn't a problem in your diet, enjoy!  If so, you may want to consider their lower sodium version (personally, I have yet to try it).<br /><br />I use my Showtime Rotisserie at least once a week and Morton's Seasoning Blend is the BEST product I have ever used in prepping my chickens or cornish game hens.  The family loves it and with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob, you will be a hero with the family!<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"
4,"Seems to help, I sleep well and if I do wake up I'm not long getting back to sleep.<br />I ordered two boxes and I'm about to buy two more."
4,"These cookies are really more like crackers.  Thin and crunchy and very slightly sweet.  The sweetness comes from the fig, but they smell wonderfully of honey.  Great with tea."
4,"I made this in a regular coffee maker made for pods.<br />I thought it was find - it reminded me most of a breakfast blend.  It was very smooth with what seemed like a normal dose of caffeine.  It's not at all bitter - unfortunately, around here, we LIKE bitter in our beer and coffee, so I probably would not buy it again.  If, however, you like something like Maxwell House Breakfast Blend with a mild flavor, but a bit more caffeine, you'll probably really like it.<br />I love that it is fair trade.  I had to use scissors to open the packets."
4,"This syrup is so thick and delicious - I have started using it instead of starbucks mocha powder in my coffee.  It tastes so much better and is also healthy.  The price is a bit steep but I don't use huge amounts every day so the price is worth it to me for a quality product that tastes so wonderful!!"
4,"Whole spelt tastes SO much better and milder than whole wheat!It's a great product.Holds shape well.Digests easier.Whole grain benefits.I like it a lot."
4,"in an effort to shed a few pounds, i decided to restrict my diet to high protein foods, vegetables, and nuts. When I learned that jerky was a great snack for dieters who wanted protein on-the-go, while avoiding the added carbs in meal replacement bars, I searched for a brand of jerky that was right for me.<br /><br />Knowing very little about jerky (save for the junk in convenience stores), I learned that most brands are full of hormones, nitrites, antibiotics, MSG, and erythorbate. Supposedly, none of these ingredients are harmful in moderation, but I was looking for a snack that I could rely on whenever I had food cravings, and I couldn't afford to compromise my health in the long run by regularly consuming any of these items. So, I was pleased to find out about Golden Valley's line of all natural jerky.<br /><br />Aside from the benefit of finding a vendor that produced a jerky free of preservatives and added MSG, there was the added bonus of learning that federal law actually prohibits the use of growth hormone in buffalo. My mind at ease, I ordered the peppered buffalo jerky and received it in record time using the super saver shipping option.<br /><br />As a meat snack, I found the product to be too sweet for my liking, but nevertheless adequate for my purposes. The texture is milder than the low quality jerky that I'm familiar with, but the pepper flavor could easily go unnoticed as it's way too understated. Every bag that I received was moist and easy to chew and the product was free of flaw or defect.<br /><br />At $1.49/oz., I get 11 grams of protein for the cost of 90 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 7 grams of sugar. Compare this to the leading meal replacement bar on Amazon that costs $2.07/bar for 27 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of fat, 26 grams of sugar (51 grams of total carbs), and a litany of unwanted ingredients in each 3.5-oz. bar. Ounce-for-ounce, we're looking at 11 grams of protein in the jerky versus roughly 8 grams of protein in the bar. Even considering the disappointing sweetness of the jerky, I still manage to avoid all the unwanted carbs and confections of replacement bars. Of course, jerky loses out in terms of cholesterol content.<br /><br />Jerky connoisseurs will likely find the sweetness of this product to be unappealing and off-putting. On the other hand, it's been a great diet aid and a reliable, additive-free defense against mid-meal cravings, and that's really all I wanted out of Golden Valley's Buffalo Jerky."
4,"great service and delivery for a really good product. i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best, along with green mountain..."
4,"Highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee, Wolfgang's Sumatra Kopi Raya excites the flavor buds and ignites one's morning... always a good start to any day."
4,"This flavor is very good and unexpected.  The flavor of the cheese and garlic go well together and they are very crispy and satisfying."
4,"I like this tea. I substitute this for coffee some mornings. It has a nice flavor and is great with cream and sugar. My little girls use it for tea parties. Great tea!"
4,"First off,  let me state that I am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type.  But I often have guests over who ask for de-caf, so I gave this a try.<br /><br />While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain ""different"" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: ""it really is delicious for a decaf.""<br /><br />The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.<br /><br />The package had to be snipped open with scissors --this is tightly packed!-- and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.<br /><br />I'll stick with regular coffee, but I'm sure my de-caf loving friends will enjoy this."
4,"With all the nonsense about pet food recalls and melamine, it's important to know where your pet food originates. This food does not originate in China and contains no wheat gluten. The chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down. However, watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food. All three of my cats do eat dry food (Nutro). I like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration. I am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing. The cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in China, and the expensive ones aren't cost effective for me to provide as a snack. This food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can (through Amazon, less through subscribe and save) and it contains high grade (human grade) ingredients. I thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet (BARF for cats). It's messy, requires counter space, time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product. Therefore I try to get the best dry food I can and supplement it with canned food like this.<br /><br />All three cats liked both varieties of food. 3 cats = 2 cans once a day. The dry food is at will - they munch on that when they like. So far, so good. No increased mess in litter box from soupy ingredients, either. Their appetites remain strong for both this wet food and their dry food."
4,"This is probably the best mass-produced beef jerky on the market.  It isn't too tough or dry like cheaper brands, isn't too sweet or spicy either.  Only problem is that as a snack I feel it isn't overly healthy.  (It has MSG, sodium nitrite and a lot of sodium).  However it is a low-fat, high-protein food, and very tasty."
4,"We like a good beef jerky, so after reading all the positive reviews for this beef jerky, We thought we'd give it a try.<br /><br />The pros:<br />+  The flavor is smokey & on the sweet side, which my son & I thought was very good!<br />+  A good mixture of large & small pieces.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-  After a flavor filled beef jerky chew, I ended up with a rubbery, flavorless wad that couldn't be eaten.  This didn't happen every time, but it happened too many times for me.  Oddly, this didn't seem to bother my son, who's a very picky eater?<br /><br />Update:<br />After trying a couple other brands of beef jerky, my son asked me to buy this brand again.  Because of this, I've upgraded this review from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I'd like to give this jerky a higher score, but getting those occasional rubbery pieces makes me think 4 out of 5 is a fair score."
4,"I can tell you it arrived in good shape and in good timing.  We have not opened it yet though."
4,"I first bought this syrup when it was on sale. Now my children enjoy it so much that I cannot purchase anything else for them. Grade B syrup is primarily intended for baking but both my kids prefer this on their pancakes and waffles than any of the cheap name brand syrups from the store."
4,"This is a good drink, tastes like soda, but fruity.  I really liked it, nice alternative to soda."
4,"I admit I don't often visit Taco Bell. However, I have enjoyed their bean burritos in the past, as I am a vegetarian and I appreciate that they offer several items on the value menu that I can eat. I like this sauce, and it's good on a veggie burger. I think it might work well with roasted vegetables, as a vegetable dip, but I haven't tried that just yet. Tasty!"
4,"el sabroso salsitas chips.  pleased as i am most of time. great flavor, great service."
4,"I enjoy using these bags.  I have a dog training book (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446675385"">Good Owners, Great Dogs</a>) with a picture of a dog pooping, and the caption says: ""To those of you who do not have housebreaking problems with your pet, this picture may seem a bit crass. But for those of you who have struggled with this particular behavior, a dog doing his business outside is a thing of beauty and a joy forever."" Well, I think of this whenever I unfurl one of these bags.  My rescue dog may have came with all sorts of training issues, but bless her, she is perfectly house trained.<br /><br />The bags are a decent size, wide enough to encompass the target. They are long enough to tie with enough clean part at the top, but would be even nicer if they were a bit longer. They are occasionally hard to open. Each roll is approx. 2.25 inches wide and 1.25 inches thick, including a plastic core which seems unnecessary to me.  I don't have a Bags on Board brand dispenser but they fit into a dispenser purchased at Pet Food Express. The bags are printed so you can see where to tear, which is nice. The ""Ocean Mist"" scent is not what I would call a ""fresh, clean fragrance"" - a bit cloying and sweet - but it does help mask that other fresh fresh fragrance. The bags are a pretty color but the contents do show through a bit.<br /><br />All in all, these bags are a worthy buy. I will no longer risk the horror of grocery store plastic bags that sometimes have holes in them."
4,"Weavers is one great coffee. Was looking for the best type (french roast, peru, house etc) and so far have't found one they all taste superb, smooth, low acidity, no after taste all round wonderfull."
4,"I too think these strips are a bit too sweet - but this one has 10 grams of protein. Now the that prices have gone up, it's close to what I would pay in the one store in my town that sells them. It also took weeks to get them with the free shipping.  So hmm..."
4,"I am writing this on behalf of my dog, who enjoys this product.  He's a fairly strong chewer, this is a sizable bone for 40 lb dog and it keeps him occupied.  So far have had no issues w/ splintering or chipping.  Would buy again."
4,"These are excellent chocolates. The outer dark chocoate coating is a very creamy and smooth chocolate. If you like dark chocolate, you'll like these. They are addictive! If you are not a fan of dark chocolate, I would suggest trying the milk chocolate truffles (red wrappers). In addition to chocolate truffles, Lindt also offers a variety of other flavors."
4,"I expected that this would be all natural cinnamon oil, as was the clove oil purchased from the same company.  The ingredients label said it contains natural & artificial cinnamon flavors.  I was disappointed in the artificial flavors, but it did produce satisfactory watermelon pickles.<br /><br />Then, I found a two pack of the exact same product from the same company at Walmart locally for only $2.17 versus the $2.74 for only one dram bottle and felt scrooged.  I understand this is because of their ""free shipping,"" but could have paid much less.<br /><br />Overall, I wish the description had said it contained artificial flavors. (and yes, I have heard that they are identical in chemical composition and are perfectly safe.  I would just prefer all natural for the price)"
4,"I bought these for a special recipe which turned out a flop.  The cookies are yummy on there own.  I would definately buy if they were sold in stores (I had to buy a case w/Amazon)."
4,"This was a classic black pudding that cooks up like American sausage patties and has a mild allspice flavor. Product arrived frozen with pack of dry ice."
4,"I can't say whether or not these have any true health promoting effects (except for my skeletal issues I'm a healthy specimen), but I like the idea of using salt that comes from an ancient source and has micro nutrients in it, and I've used this in cooking.<br /><br />Big caution though, the product is MUCH saltier than regular salt, so be careful before you add it or sprinkle it on something!"
4,"I ordered the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew bars and I was pleasantly surprised how good they tasted. My husband likes them and so does my daughter. The only thing is I wished they had a little less sugar. The nutritional facts say they have 14g of sugar. Now 14 grams of sugar is not bad if you are comparing it to a candy bar but for a nutritional bar I would ideally like 10g of sugar or less."
4,"I bought this because I was bored with the usual gluten-free granola. This is a great change, with a great blend of quality ingredients. Try it."
4,"These are the first puffs-type food I've given my 9mo.  He really seems to love them!  I came on to order a case of a different flavor to try.<br /><br />I'm giving 4 stars because the packaging could be better.  The cap and lid doesn't stay on that well.  I think I will have to put a peice of masking tape on the next container.  I do wish there was no sugar in them, but it does have much less than other puffs.  I like the organic ingredients of course.  And the price w/ subscribe and save is cheaper than convetional products at the store."
4,"This is a fun way to vamp up a champagne toast - or a cocktail!! The flowers have a very nice fruity flavor that doesn't taint the drink itself. My fiance and I are going to use these at our wedding reception for our champagne toast and we are very excited to hear what our family and friends think! We liked them a lot!"
4,"These are just as described, ""SWEET AND CRUNCHY PHILLO DOUGH PASTRIES""...love these just as much as the baklawa with walnuts...yummm!!"
4,"Maxwell House International Latte in Peppermint Mocha flavor adds the perfect touch to the holiday season! Quick and easy to make, just add hot water and stir. The wonderful aroma will grab your attention immediately - as well as those around you - and set a mellow and relaxing mood! A nice, creamy froth tops the mug as you stir. The peppermint flavor is very good. The mocha is OK and the coffee could be a little stronger, in my opinion. Over all, it's a fine cup of latte made for an autumn evening (or morning!), a simple pleasure at a great price. If you are a fan of peppermint and coffee, I highly recommend that you give this a try."
4,"Michael Keaton was already on his way to being a major star when he played the ghost with the most in ""Beetlejuice."" His performance in the title role simply solidified his status as one of Hollywood's brightest comedy stars.<p>Now, years later, this film still generates the same belly laughs that it did when it was first released. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis have fun in their roles as husband and wife who are surprised to find themselves dead, but they are merely window-dressing for Keaton's centerpiece. The only complaint here is that there are a few too many gross-out gags, but that is something which has come to define many of director Tim Burton's films. Still, the movie is a lot of fun from beginning to end, and it's worth considering adding it to your video collection."
4,"So these are pretty good. They are really tasty and melt in your mouth. The only complaint I have is that each packet is pretty small (it seems like if you emptied out the contents, it would barely fill between 1 to 2 cups). I lowered my rating by 1 star because it's pretty pricey for the amount you receive. But I usually hate dried fruit (this was an exception), so I bought it anyways."
4,"Good product. Helped me get thru century ride. Fair price compared to local vendor.  Great tasting also.  Small packets fit in shirt and easily opened while riding."
4,"How can anyone go wrong with Chocolate Raspberry Truffle?  I enjoyed this K-cup and would absolutely reorder."
4,"The package arrived promptly and all contents in excellent condition. The product is very tasty, though it is a slight bit too peppery for my taste. I have tried all their varieties, and I like this one and Texas BBQ best. The mesquite is also good, and much milder. They have the texture just right--you wouldn't know it wasn't meat if it were a blind taste test. It is a little wet as a jerky, which makes it a tad messy. Each packet contains a whopping 10 grams of protein! A lot of nutrition in a small, lightweight packet. Ideal for camping, keeping in the car glovebox,in a briefcase or bag, etc. for those times when you need a boost. But for the pepper, I would have given 5 stars, so I rate this 4 stars. Enjoy!"
4,"From a health & wellness perspective, I defer to the other reviews which are quite thorough and complete.  From a taste perspective, this product must be served cold to have a fresh refreshing taste. Many waters are served warm, especially if you walk or travel with it. This is not one I would suggest for that purpose.  Served cold, the taste is clean, crisp and refreshing. If the water isn't quite chilled the taste may edge toward ""left on the night stand over night and degassed..."""
4,"Has a nice mild flavor, I like it both alone or with Milk and Honey as listing suggested. My only small grip is the packaging is paper instead of foil but not a big deal."
4,"I bought this because I like shrimp salad sandwiches, and it was very tasty, and I got 3 sandwiches out of every can. I'm satisfied with the value of the purchase."
4,"Though the lower than usual price caught my attention, I was concerned that this coffee, marketed for Keurig, was not packed in the common cups.  Rather, the coffee is in small bags.  Not to worry! They fit as well as the usual cups do. I was so pleased with my first order, I have ordered several more...and given some as gifts to other Keurig fans."
4,"We do not eat wheat and most brands of rice crackers are a lot more expensive than these were.  They are just a bit on the sweet side, rather than the salty flavor one expects from a ""cracker"".  But they are good, with soup or salad or alone...in which case topping them with a dab of peanut butter makes them even better.<br /><br />A pretty good crunch for the money.  Personally I still prefer Mary's Gone crackers, but my husband says those are too hard to chew, so now we have something crunchable for each of us!"
4,"My babies really love these.  The only problem is that they are easily crushed.  Shipping always seems to make about half the biscuits into little pieces.  The dogs like them anyway but it is harder to know if you are giving too much to them."
4,"That is the analysis of our six and eight year old grandsons, ""better than professional."" They used it to flavor sno-cones and slushies and will soon try it with soda. We were not disappointed with the full root beer taste."
4,"These were the perfect addition to the goody bags for my son's party. We loved how they can actually be used to build with. They came in four flavors (cherry, banana, green--sorry don't recall the flavor, and blue raspberry). My kids didn't love the banana flavor, but that's okay because I did. They are kind of sweet-tart like but not really sour and quite a bit harder. I'd buy them again."
4,"I also bought these at Costco for $10.00 per box which included 24 bags that are .8 oz each.  My kids are fighting over the few remaining bags, and they are very good, but I won't be buying them again due to the price.  The high price will prevent this product from reaching mass distribution."
4,"I liked it, although I can't brew it as strong as Starbucks recommends.<br /><br />The vanilla added a nice fragrance to the coffee (and, unlike what others have said, I -did- definitely taste the vanilla). Just remember Starbucks is formulated to be mixed with milk. It's really not at it's best when it''s black--with or without vanilla."
4,"This is an instant cappuccino similar to what I have bought in gas stations.  It makes a medium size cup.  It is very sweet and I like it for a change of pace.  Just be aware, this is not coffee shop cappuccino."
4,"First impression upon unwrapping, each piece is a bit on the small side.  Upon eating, it is as a hard candy which gradually melts in mouth with a good flavor while melting.  Finally, once the outside melts, the inside is soft and chewy and also has a good flavor. In that this product has some vitamin content in addition to an enjoyable flavor, I think it's a worthwhile buy, providing the price is not too high."
4,"Received fairly quickly.  I have been using pods for years so not a new concept.  I bought for use with solofill which is another review.  Did not work that well.  I am now using the pods in my Starbucks French Press mugs with my Keurig.  Just throw the pods in, dispense the boiling water, put the cover on, pump a few times and you can either pour into another mug or just start drinking at your liesure.  I will have to see how the subscription works.  I had enough purchase for free shipping so I will see in two months when the next shipment arrives.  The medium roast is not strong at all.  No floaters to strain through your teeth."
4,"Recently, I tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELBH8"">Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey</a> cookies.  Then someone brought a package of the Cranberry type to work.  I like the cranberry cookies better.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are good. They are thin, but that was the idea, wasn't it? The cookies have a nice texture. You can taste the cranberries. The calorie count, 140 for three cookies, is about the same as the granola bars that I sometimes snack on. Just don't eat the whole box at once.<br /><br />The ingredients are also reasonable with the exception of the use of palm oil. As palm oil use has increased dramatically over the past ten years, commercial growers have been clearing rain forests in Indonesia and Malaysia to create palm oil plantations. The palm oil is used in food production, as in these cookies, and in the manufacture of bio-fuels. The result is a loss of endangered species and ironically increased carbon emission. There has been some movement to either reduce palm oil use or use only palm oil from sustainable sources. There have even been stories of girl scouts agitating to sell only palm-oil-free cookies.<br /><br />Kraft is aware of the palm oil situation. It is not clear that they are doing anything about it. This is from a July 15, 2009 Wall Street Journal article: ""Kraft spokesman Richard D. Buino said that while the company supports the RSPO's [Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil] efforts, 'it is clear more work is needed to consolidate standards, enforce principles, verify traceability along the supply chain and ensure competitive pricing to bring certified palm oil to market. We're monitoring the RSPO process and actively engaging our suppliers to monitor their certification efforts to find viable options for sourcing sustainable palm oil.' Neither Nestl&eacute; nor Kraft directly addressed purchases of Malaysia's certified palm oil."""
4,"This product works well with most kinds of meat.  Gives a little extra zip to the flavor of the meat."
4,"The herbs when useing the granmder , makes them smell like there are freash. Use them all the time."
4,"A friend gave me some of these dog treats for a gift for my dog and they are the best.  My dog loves them and I can easily break off a small piece for training purposes.  My only problem is that I have a hard time finding them in stores so was glad to beable to purchase them on amazon."
4,"I had never had Mallomars before so I couldn't resist tasting them.  These are definately delicious cookies.  The cookie part is sort of like a chocolate chip cookie without the chips and then there is marshmallow and chocolate coating.  Very good.  But they are fairly fragile cookies.  They fall apart a bit when you take a bite and since these were shipped to me, half were already falling apart before I could take any bites."
4,"I was looking for an olive oil re fill at the market and could not find anything that I liked.  Everything that looked decent was way over priced and there just was not a great selection.  I always forget to look for food on amazon but it struck me and after a quick search I found the Zoe.<br />This olive oil is a good value for the quality and quantity you receive.  Its got a nice darker color and olive flavor.  This will be my everyday oil to use in pans, cooking, and even a fast salad if I dont feel like taking out the expensive stuff."
4,"My dogs love these bones. They're covered with meat/jerky and my dogs adore stripping these parts off. Unfortunately, the bones are also EXTREMELY messy. I only give them to my dogs on hardwood floors or outside since the bones crumb a lot and are quite greasy."
4,"These are pretty good, but you've gotta realize that each pack is the size of a pack of peanuts.  A lot of the space in each bag is air.  I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.<br /><br />Flavorwise, they're alright.  Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of.  They're not amazing though.  You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time.  This is very light flavored."
4,"This new offering from Kelloggs has good crunch and nice cinnamon flavor.  The almonds were a welcome addition.  It stood up well to soy milk and was tasty on its own.  The flavor is reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie and gets added kudos for the fiber content and being low fat.<br /><br />I did think it was a tad too sweet and I wasn't thrilled with the sugar content.  The almonds were hard and overall it would have benefitted from more almonds and raisins.<br /><br />I enjoyed this cereal and will add it to my breakfast rotation."
4,"so... it taste like ink to me but really works in waking me up. dark roast."
4,"My husband loves coffee and he found this product to be very good. The first thing he notice when he opened the  package is the wonderful rich coffee smell, and yes it tastes as good as it smells. He uses 7 1/2 to 8 scoops for a 12 cup pot since he like his coffee a little on the stronger side. He stated that this coffee is low on acidity, plus he has tried the Gevalia coffees, they taste good, but were too acid for people with a sensitive stomach. Once you open the can, store it in the freezer, take it out only when you need to make a pot of coffee, then put it back in the freezer and the coffee will stay almost as fresh as the day you opened the package.<br /><br />Though I am more of a tea drinker, I do have my share of coffee. I personally enjoy the Hazelnut features a delicate aroma. A flavor like this is perfect dessert coffee; it is a sweet reward anytime. Vanilla Almond is another flavored coffee I enjoy time to time also.<br /><br />Overall, it's a consistent, smooth, delicious coffee. It does not bite back at you and it doesn't ""challenge"" your palate. It stands alone (black) and holds its own when mixed with milk and sugar. If I HAD to present a criticism, it might be that the ground stuff is sort of fine which does not make it compatible with certain types of coffee makers. For us, it works wonderfully with my good old Mr. Coffee."
4,"Pretty good product.  It's a small bottle that tasted good, even not chilled.  The energy kick is a bit less than a small cup of Starbucks coffee, for me at least.  But there is no jitter either.  If you are a caffeine addict, you may need more than one shot.  At $1/bottle it's a good deal as well."
4,"This made a very good wine, good price but all of the vino wines i have purchased (5) had to be back sweetened, maybe just my taste but they all turned out very well."
4,"I absolutely love these energy shots.  They taste great and are reasonably priced.  I've now ordered two packages.  Unfortunately, the 2nd package arrived with the dried residue from a leaky bottle caked onto almost every bottle in the carton.  I really do love the product, but it's gross to open each bottle and have crusty stuff crumble off of it.  Hopefully this was a one-off situation."
4,"These are a winner.  As soon as I received these I called some friends and arranged a S'mores making party around their firepit.<br /><br />Being the same classic graham cracker that the kids knew and loved, there were no complaints on the flavour, no complaints on oats being on the cracker or on the cracker being ""different"".  Additionally, since the crackers are perfectly S'mores sized right out of the packet, there was less fuss about one kid having a more perfectly broken cracker than another, and fewer frazzled parents trying to juggle sticky burnt marshmallows while aiming for the perfect break along the serrated line for fussy kids.<br /><br />Another plus is that these are packaged in stacks of 8, which is both a perfect size for snacking and for toting around.<br /><br />This is frazzled parent and fussy kid approved. I will definitely be buying more for the summer camping trips."
4,"The shipment came in a timely fashion and package arrived undamaged. This honey arrived as advertised. Bottle was sealed appropriately."
4,"I like these casing a lot.  I used to use larger ones that held 3 lbs of meat, but prefer these smaller ones because they fit slightly less than a pound each and you can experiment with smaller amounts of sausage at a time.  Made 20 sausages at this point, with only one casing ever breaking on me (though I admit I may have stuffed it too tightly). I'll definitely buy again."
4,"I use in cake, ice cream and spread.. Very versatile ! Love it. I would recommend the home chef to try this product. Affordable and tasty!"
4,"My dogs absolutely love this food.  I did a food test by putting each dog food we have at home next to the Orijen, every time, our dogs chose the Orijen bag! Thanks, The Cohen family, and the three fur-kids"
4,"Price feels high but I guess that's what it takes to ship candy from the Internet in not-really-bulk compared to larger retailers and distributors. Candy tastes great. Overall I recommend this if you're looking for it."
4,"Community Coffee is a great Product. I've been drinking Community for over 20 years and the quality hasn't changed.  Its difficult to find in Georgia and the price has gone up considerably. When I found it on Amazon with free shipping, I ordered it imediately!!!"
4,"The fragrance of this conditioner is mild and pleasant. It nourishes the scalp and hair well. It has reduced my hair fall to quite an extent. After using it, the hair feels softer and nice."
4,"Using Maxwell House decaffeinated coffee bags is a great way to have a cup of coffee whenever you like without having to make a full pot of coffee. It's great at home and especailly convenient in the office when no one else wants a cup of coffee. Maxwell House decafeinated coffee bags is the greatest invention since the ATM. Thank you very much for this simple pleasure."
4,"i purchased this at whole foods as well but felt the need to comment since i depend on comments myself for purchases. this is a great product and smells divine. i use this mainly for eating and cooking purposes but will be trying it for lotion and deoderant. good choice for a coconut oil :)"
4,"First, go to this website: [...]<br />Look for the rating section, and find the food that you are feeding your dog or cat right now, (they have a cat food link). Look for the ratings, and see what your food is rated. Then go up to the next rating, and see if you can find a better quality brand, for about the same price (this is exactly how I found a better rated brand). Do the research, and see what you can do to, get your pet the best possible rating, that you can AFFORD. Keep in mind too, that with less fillers, your dog will get more use out of the food, and it actually goes further than the cheap foods. The doggie waste is also much less in the yard. AND,,,lets just say that he has a much smaller problem with room clearing gas problems, when eating a premium food.<br /><br />This brand is one of the few that gets a five star rating on [...] - this website has proved to be indispensable for help in picking out a decent food for our dogs, but nothing is fool proof, when it comes to how that food is produced, and that is the fault of the government not having enough oversight over what can be put into the food. It is sad, because our pets deserve better. After using a ""premium brand"" food brand Iams, for year, I was very sad to learn how terrible the food actually was/is for the high price. Again,,,you don't have to purchase THIS brand, but get the best food for the money that you can afford for them. Having a website like Amazon, is actually the most helpful because just about EVERY brand mentioned on the dog food site, can be purchased and delivered to your door - something for me that is well worth, not having to lug around that huge bag.<br /><br />Yes it  [this brand], is expensive. However, in light of all of the Salmonella outbreaks happening to even the BEST of dog food companies, (like Buffalo), I chose this company, because they have not had a recall on their products, that I could track down. I was using Premium Plus (another expensive brand,,but they have had a few recalls, for unclean factories and fungal tainted batches). If you are like us, your pets are no less important to you, than your children. Truthfully, unless we hand cook everything for our dogs, we have no control over the way the food is made, or what goes into it. Sadly, there is also no oversight, as to what they are allowed to put into that food. This often includes any and all scraps and pieces of whatever ""animal product"", that will be the base protein, being used for that type of food, (any of these scraps qualifies for ""meat"").<br />Because of the recalls on so many brands, I still keep a watchful eye on the company, and hope that they keep up their standards for a clean facility, on a regular basis, to try and keep up with the quality and safety of his food, to the best of my ability. Better to be safe than sorry with a sick pup. Or worse yet losing him to a food born illness caused by tainted food.<br /><br />Be warned though, if you have a very large breed dog, the kibble size on this brand, is EXTREMELY small! We have since put his food into a ""Kong Feeder"" that he has to roll around, to get the food out, which forces him to, take his time in eating it. If we didn't do this, he would totally gulp down an entire bowl, within minutes, often getting sick, because it was not chewed up at all."
4,"Very good option if you are looking for flax.  It is very finely ground so if you want flax that is a little more coarse try another product.<br /><br />Jacqui"
4,"These are pretty good and I prefer them to anything else I have found, but there are more pits that I would expect and some of the cherries are pretty discolored like they may have started turning bad or something."
4,"The service and quality were excellent, I can't find anything as good in the mid-west."
4,"I do like the Lime taste. It's pretty strong, and very unique. However, at no point in time did I feel like I was eating ""Lime and Chili"" almonds. There was absolutely no kick from the chili.<br /><br />Very tasty still, but not what I was hoping for."
4,"I have a small 11 lb. dog and these work perfectly for his poops. However, I don't think these would work well for large dogs and their larger feces.<br /><br />I have been using these bags for about a year now. There was one batch I ordered this past year where EVERY SINGLE bag in the box was open at the seams so basically they were completely USELESS. I had read about this in the reviews so was not completely surprised but obviously I was upset that I had to throw away the entire box. However, like the title of my review states, 9/10 times the bags have worked perfectly and were sturdy enough to do the job they're supposed to do!<br /><br />Will continue buying these and just cross my fingers that I don't get a bad batch!"
4,"This is a very good source of fiber with good taste and texture that even picky eaters enjoy."
4,"We like this brownie mix and I usually use the low fat recipe on it. I also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry.<br /><br />We still buy this by the case."
4,"I liked all the K-cup coffees.  This one was strong/dark but was not overly bitter.  I used it with the travel mug setting on the coffee maker and it was just right."
4,"I've had good experience with pod teas in the past, so I was hoping that now that I have a Keurig brewer I'd be able to find some good tea blends.  This Madarin Orange Spice Herbal Tea is really good.  It has a pleasant orange spice flavor that is strong enough when brewed at the maximum 12 oz setting of my Cuisinart Keuring brewer.  Add a little sweetener of your choosing and it makes a refreshing beverage hot or over ice.  I will definitely buy again when I use up these portions."
4,"MultiGrain Cheerios is a wonderful cereal for breakfast or really just about any other time of the day! Although it's probably not quite as healthy as General Mills would like you to believe, it's really not bad for you, either. In a 1 cup serving, it contains very little fat, no cholesterol and it has some fiber in it, too. It also has 100% of the daily recommended amounts of things like iron, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12. It does fall short on other things including Vitamins A (10% of recommended daily intake) and C (25% of recommended daily intake). You can click on the ""nutrition facts"" link above to find out more about what this cereal contains. Please note that this cereal does contain 6 grams of sugar per 1 cup serving, so if you need to watch your sugar intake very carefully you may want to find another breakfast cereal.<br /><br />On top of what it gives you health wise, it tastes delicious without being overly sugary; and I like that. A 1 cup serving also gives you 10% of the recommended daily intake of fiber and I think that must come from the whole grain ingredients of this cereal. In addition, it's kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't have to watch your sugar and you're getting a good diet with vitamins and fiber in it already, this is a very good cereal. It's not the very healthiest but it's far from junk food and it tastes great! I recommend it."
4,"I took the box of Marley Coffee pods to work for a group tasting.  The general consensus was that the coffee is very good - 4 stars!  Common terms used by my taste testing group included: light, hints of citrus, crisp, acidic, and brisk.  One close friend admired the clean taste and commented on how well this would go with a cheesecake or similar heavy dessert.  I couldn't agree more.  The pods worked perfectly in our office's Senseo machine, and we all enjoyed the chat and the coffee.  For the price listed, most of my friends, and I, agree this is well worth the cost.  Given that it's organic and free-trade, the cost is very good.  I normally only use coffee that is grown and traded under these circumstances.  I would highly recommend trying this coffee if you enjoy types such as breakfast blend from other coffee companies."
4,"We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that ""baby food"" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U"">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby."
4,"These arrived in a sealed bag, and were fresh. This is the first time I've tasted these and they are great! Healthy alternative to M&M's, and still crunchy. I've convinced others to try these just by letting them try some. Make sure you order at least a pound, because this size is a little small when you are sharing with others."
4,"With so many different additives to water these days, what distinguishes this one?<br /><br />It comes in a larger bottle of 12 ounces and makes 24 8-ounce servings. This fruit punch flavor is light (similar to, but not heavy like Hawaiin Punch), and I found it refreshing. It has a combination of vitamins B 6, 5, 3, and 12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, and Chromium. Most importantly it has approximately the same level of caffeine as soda, so I can get a nice little jolt.<br /><br />I use a lot of powdered additives to my water, and enjoy the fact that this liquid fully dissolved, unlike the powders. I am keeping this next to my refrigerator and give my bottles their treatment as I take them out of the fridge, before I jump in the car. However, I have had some warm, and it was OK then as well. I don't add a lot to my water, I couldn't figure out how much a squeeze was, and so I started light, and it works nicely for me.<br /><br />The one thing I would like to mention is that the servings are 8 oz size, and most water bottles are 12-16 ounce. If you are figuring price per serving, do keep this in mind. Also, it is recommended that you use this within 30 days of opening it.<br /><br />I have small hands, and often have trouble with pull off tops under seals, so I have the habit of keeping a sharp knife handy to run around the top and remove it. So I opened my bottle using my normal technique ... the extra hermetically sealed package wasn't a problem for me.<br /><br />Good flavor, reasonable price. I will be finishing my sample bottle and looking for it in the market."
4,"This may not be the best truffle oil out there but for the price, it's very good, especially for an avid home cook. This oil is very aromatic and the flavor stands up well in soups and other foods. I use it a lot in soups. The best part for me is that this is affordable enough to try on all sorts of dishes I make at home. I've had truffle oil infused dishes at fine restaurants and I think the biggest difference, for my palate, is that the more expensive oils are slightly smoother in after taste. My husband can't tell the difference. But that is mostly due to the type of olive oil used from what I've been told, which makes sense since olive oil taste varies from brand to brand (and quality!). Nonetheless, I think the Urbani White Truffle Oil is a great way to add that extra dazzle to meals at home without sacrificing taste or money."
4,"I got the chance to try a sample of Celestial Seasonings Southern Sweet Tea as a BzzAgent.  I love iced tea and Keurig, but I usually like a less sweet tea, so I have to admit to being skeptical when I popped that Celestial Seasonings Southern Sweet Tea K-Cup into my Keurig.  I needn't have worried!  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the iced tea this brews.  I used the 6 oz setting to get a stronger tea flavor, and this K-Cup delivered exactly that.  It has a nice strong black tea flavor, and it is lightly sweet, not at all overpoweringly sweet like I was expecting.  Pop a slice of lemon in there and you've got the perfect glass of sweet iced tea in less than a minute!"
4,"my little tree is adorable. i won't lie i thought it would be much bigger. But it comes in a nice pot with a little rock for decoration.. the tree is healthy so i am excited to see if i cant grow it!"
4,"This isn't one of my 7.5 month old's favorite flavors but she'll still eat it though. It's a bit runny to me so I add a bit of rice cereal to thicken the texture up a bit. I also added a bit of formula to this on the first few tries so that my baby got used to the taste. Consistency of each jar is very good and packaging is absolutely secure.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts from label:<br />Calories 50, Protein 9%, Vitamin A 10%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 4%"
4,"taste is good<br />and only reason i bought is because of the ACAI berry which is a super fruit but sadly they dont display in any way or format how much ACAI berry are in each glass.<br />SO I WOULD LIKE MORE ACAI IN SIDE AND A LISTING OF HOW MUCH PER GLASS<br /><br />until then this drink can never ever be 5 stars"
4,"Prior to the installation of the electric fence, a family of river otters loved to come into my yard and destroy the landscaping.  Since its installation, they have not come into the yard."
4,"Good price, came quickly and since there were two, I kept one and gave one to my mom . She added some to some sauteed baby portabello mushrooms and they were delicious."
4,"Legends of China Organic White Tea used to be available at local store, but they stopped carrying it and we switched to another, inferior brand.  Was so pleased to see it on Amazon!  We don't drink it often, but sometimes we want the soothing, relaxing benefits of white tea."
4,"This product lived up to its hype. Gave a great jump start to my day. I drink it during my morning workout. Not one to drink anything but water and black coffee, I added more water than recommended. Nice flavor, for you old folks, kinda reminds me of Tang. Only problem is that it doesn't stay mixed. Not a problem if you added it to a water bottle, just give it a shake before you take a sip."
4,"Mariani's Tropical Medley of dried fruits is a delicious mix.  My kids and I absolutely love it.  There are all kinds of different colors, flavors,and textures here, as the medley includes pineapple, apricots, papaya, raisins, golden raisins, apples, and coconut.  I would have given this product five stars, but it does have added sugar and yellow dye number 6.  Still, it's a great snack and a far better choice for a sweet craving than candy!"
4,"I've been having trouble sleeping lately, and go in to work dragging, so I tried a Rehab to wake me up. I drank it around 5pm (I work evenings). I was buzzing like a bee until about 10pm when I began to crash. But it was a good crash. The kind that says, ""Hey, it's time for bed"". When I got home, I slept.<br /><br />I tried it again the next day, and sure enough, same thing. I got to bed at a decent hour, slept through the night and woke up early.<br /><br />I won't be drinking this every day (it just isn't good to shock your body like that all the time), but I will certainly keep it in my fridge for those slow days and sleepless nights."
4,"Since flavor can be so subjective, I will try my best to draw comparisons.  The new Crunchy Nut cereal is similar to Honey Nut Cheerios size.  They're slightly sweeter than Honey Nut Cheerios but with milk added, the flavor reminds me to Corn Pops.  And it's definitely sweeter than your Honey Bunches of Oat available at Costco in the 2 pack.  This cereal doesn't get soggy as fast as Corn Pops or Honey Bunches of Oat.  It's also 100 calories per serving.  I'm more of a Special K with Strawberries type of guy so I enjoy a little sour/fruity flavor along with my sweet cereal.  I hope this review helps in your decision whether to try it or not."
4,"My husband loved the coffee and keeps it to brew for special occasions/guests."
4,"After trying lots of different blends in K-Cups over the past couple of years, I've settled on a mix of Tully's French Roast and Newman's Extra Bold as my go-to choices for morning wake up coffees.  Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other ""sweet"" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand."
4,"When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in ""pods"". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod."
4,"I must admit, I was hoping for something a little more sour than sweet.  The lime flavor is a bit mild for the margarita flavor I was expecting but it was still quite good.  It was more sweet than expected but not too sweet.  Some lime drinks are as sweet as boxed key lime pie but this is quite refreshing with the hint of lime finish."
4,"I originally bought these to help get my husband's cholesterol down.  This is another method to get in oatmeal without having to make a hot cereal.  I even pack them as a quick breakfast on the go.  The Chocolate Brownie and Cranberry are our favorite varieties."
4,"I have one dog that loved it! (She's food motivated) My other dog wouldn't stay interested long enough to figure out how to lift the plastic ""lids.""  That being said for the price I think it is a good deal."
4,"Am getting regular delivery of these gluten-free crackers.  They are great with sharp cheddar cheese.  The price through Amazon is much better than local stores, but either way, most crackers are not whole but in pieces.  So if you like whole crackers, forget it.  I have contacted Glutino about this issue and received a number of coupons in the mail for my efforts.  But I don't see any change in the ability to have whole crackers even though there are two air filled bags of crackers in each box.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend these crackers for taste and texture for those on gluten-free diets like I am."
4,"We rate this right up with high""er"" quality sea salts. It has a strong flavor, but tastes clean. Far better than any typical table salt for sure. I'd rather buy this than kosher salt (we don't use regular iodized salt) for anything you add salt to at the table. For cooking, though, standard kosher salt is preferred by us."
4,"I read a review that said some will have almost no flavor and some will have a lot. This hit the nail on the head. Grab a handful and eat them one at a time. Some are bland like a Cheerio and some are almost sour, like jarred banana baby food is. That being said, flavor is not much of an issue. I don't see parents lining up to eat their kid's pureed peas. It's about what is better. I really don't like ANY food going into my baby's system that has a paragraph long list of ingredients that sound more like a science experiment with a recipe, but I feel better about these puffs than the Gerber ones. Also, I bought this at Target instead of from Amazon."
4,"I tried the Angenlina's Gourmet wood ears, which were OK but not great, and these as well. These are a good mix of a variety of dried mushrooms. The bag had a bit of powder and some very small bits in it, but aside from that all of the mushrooms were of good quality.<br /><br />A few had stems that never really re-hydrated (a good fresh shitake often has a tender enough stem you can eat it along with the rest of the mushroom), so that was a waste of money, but most were good.<br /><br />These wood ears are not quite the same as the tree ears I am used to (re-hydrating to a brown color and not being quite as crispy as the tree ears I have used before).<br /><br />On the whole, this is a good price of a whole bunch of dried mushrooms in one bag."
4,"Also known as pinhead oatmeal. It has more texture than the rolled oats use for American-style oatmeal, and I much prefer that. Nifty reusable can. I'd give it five stars except that I cannot get that excited over oatmeal of any sort."
4,"I have tasted a few nutrition/weight loss shakes in my time, and this was pretty much like the others.  I liked the chocolate taste.  To me, it actually tasted a lot like Slimfast or some generic grocery store versions I've tasted.  After only one serving, I can't really rate the product on the nutrition aspect.  I may buy more cans and drink them for breakfast.  It's low fat and lo cal, so it's something I can drink quickly and better than skipping breakfast altogether.  Also, I highly recommend that you drink this very cold.  The taste is definitely better cold."
4,"If you have a multi-cat family and are struggling to find common ground to minimize digestion disturbances amongst all of them, this is a good bet.  My cats don't *love* this food, but they all tolerate it well and don't run away from it immediately after I pour it.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are unbeatable too, even for the small (2lb bags).  While it seems weird to get so many small bags, my cats appreciate it because the these bags don't reseal well, so with smaller bags, the food is fresher in general.<br /><br />As mentioned in the subject, this only applies to the Chicken flavor, my cats don't care for the others."
4,"It is difficult for me to find natural (sugar free) peanut butter at a good price. After looking on Amazon for awhile I came across this brand and the price was OK so I gave it a shot. Taste is excellent, with fresh peanut flavor. Very good consistency, more peanuts than most (Teddy's, Smuckers, Jif Natural, etc.) I did not think that the separation was really extreme, like the others have been for me. I keep it in the fridge and it still spreads remarkably well for me. Overall a good choice and a reasonable (somewhat) price."
4,"My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect."
4,"Although I would have given these a five star review, I have to take into my wife's account too. She liked them, but seemed to recognize that they were a substitute for normal pancakes."
4,"I had not had Brazil Nuts before i ordered these. I am a vegan and have read the many benefits of Brazil nuts so i thought i would get them a try. I have a home-made mix of different raw nuts and dried fruit that i add to my cream of wheat. These nuts have made a great addition to my breakfast. I find the price great, i order something else from amazon with it and it ships free. You really can not  beat that. I have also bought their cashews and almonds. I recommend this company to anyone."
4,"As a big chai fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sample Higgins & Burke's version of chai tea (which has all natural ingredients). The first time I made the tea, I steeped it for five minutes, since I prefer a stronger tea, and sweetened it with honey. My initial reaction was that it's good, but not the best I've ever had. The spices overwhelm the tea, mainly the cloves and cardamom. I really love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3SAA"">Yogi Chai Black, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> for a nice blend of spices and tea. On my next try, I added one part soy milk to two parts brewed tea. It was delicious! While the strong spices overpower the tea and aren't as evenly blended as they could be when alone, the added milk almost turns the chai into perfection. This works iced as well, but with maybe more milk and less brewed tea, depending on your preference. If you're a fan of a more spicy chai, or just chai in general, I'd highly recommend it."
4,"Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito is a wonderfully refreshing non-alcholic drink.  The overall taste is smooth and tasty with a kick of mint that puts it over the top.  The 5 calories per serving is makes this a good choice for serving the gang on those hot summer afternoons.  Each small packets makes 2 quarts and are easily portable so they can be tucked into a purse or picnic basket & reconstituted at the park or beach.  You can also pour a small amount into your bottled water and shaken at your desk for an afternoon break.  I was surprised at how much I liked the taste of this Mocktail and am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors by Crystal Light."
4,"I was starving after coming back from my workout, so I wanted something quick and healthy for my lunch. This pasta meal did the trick. It cooks up in one minute and was easily prepared by mixing the sauce tray with the pasta. The sauce made this dish. It was very flavorful and not overly salty. The pasta was served al dente. The portion was actually about right for a lunch item. The other thing I like is that it is not a frozen food item, which is great for those that don't have a refrigerator/freezer available at work to store it.<br /><br />The only downside is the high amount of carbs, which can be expected from pasta. The Amazon pricing is competitive with other meals of this sort, at roughly $3 carton. If you use Amazon's subscribe and save, and the $5 e-coupon, it is definitely a bargain and must have for that last minute lunch."
4,"My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them."
4,"I picked this off the shelf without any research, and my husband, who's pretty particular about his vodka (and tequila, and rum, but that's another story) loved this. I'm not a vodka drinker, but even I had to admit the first smell and taste were extremely pleasant and he said it tasted wonderful straight and excellent in mixed drink. Made by two guys from Pennsylvania using a copper still --definitely worth the price."
4,"I was looking for an improvement over others I've tried. I liked this better than Gu Brew or the other two I tried (can't remember the name right now) I would say Hammer Heed is a little better than Cytomax imo. Neither Cytomax or Heed left that nasty film in my mouth, but Heed was very light in flavor and texture and no stomach problems at all<br /><br />I thought this size container would last longer. I went through it pretty fast"
4,"I'm afraid that many of the negative reviews about this product rather miss the point.  They even state on the Tassimo website that these discs are best used with the addition of marshmallows or milk, but even without this information, most people would be able to figure it out for themselves.<br /><br />The Suchard disc contains chocolate syrup.  It has no milk, no cream, and no non-dairy creamer.  When most people think of ""hot chocolate,"" they think of a drink that's made with milk, no? Just like a latte or a cappucino requires the addition of milk.  Yet for some reason the same people who think nothing of adding milk to make a cappucino can't figure out that they need to do the same to make hot chocolate.  Baffling.<br /><br />Use of the Suchard disc without the addition of milk or cream (either the Tassimo milk discs or regular milk) will have the same result as diluting Hershey's syrup with water.  Expecting it to taste anything like Swiss Miss or similar packaged cocoas containing powdered milk is unrealistic and unfair.  This product is even better used with powdered milk or non-dairy creamer, as it has a richer flavor due to less dilution that way."
4,"Due to medical reasons I have to be on a high protein, lower carb diet.  These are a great snack.  It's nice to have something to crunch on instead of potato chips or tortilla chips.  The taste of these is okay.  I personally prefer the Kruncheez by Kay's Naturals.  While these don't totally taste like Parmesean, they do have a nice flavor.  The only reasons to not give 5 stars are that they don't really taste like the flavor specified, and each bag has 1.5 servings.  I really think the bag should be one serving when they are this size."
4,"First let me say that I bought this on sale for under $20.  Given that; the per pound price was a good value.  The salmon is what you'd expect from a shelf-stable product.  I'm not a huge fan of the tins so I wouldn't base my buying decision on receiving a Checkered Tin."
4,"This product has been really great for soothing my gassy baby.  I've never had a problem with supply, so I don't know if it helps there, but it does help my baby in the fussiness department!"
4,"It looks pretty good, i bought one for my dog and one for my sister's dog. I think it depends on the dog, my sister's dog loves it! loves the kong as well and these sticks fit great on it, dog plays for hours. My dog was a bit more lazy and wasn't very found of the kong in general. But the sticks do work to be put inside."
4,"I ate them all anyway.  There are new flavors for gummi bears that I got in Germany in October and these were not the same, so I was a little disappointed.  But these are still better than what you get in the supermarket, so every now and then they're worth the splurge..."
4,"Was very pleased to get this item!  It had a variety of candy in lots of sizes to bring back the past!"
4,"So glad Amazon has these.  Can't find them locally anymore.  Nice when it's cold out and you come home ""chilled to the bone"", and want something hot, but not tea, coffee or cocoa.  Something different.  I'm really fond of the Hot Apple Pie flavor.  Beware, though, it DOES contain sugar."
4,"When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is ""THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says ""Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?"" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on ""Subscibe and Save"" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off ""Subscribe and Save"" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something ""different"" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY"">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review."
4,"This coffee is great, what I really liked was the Dark Magic, I wish they made a box with only Dark Magic."
4,"Just purchased my first bottle (chilled from local Duane Reade) and all I can say is ...IT TASTES LIKE WATER. Yes, the dark color is off-putting but taste-wise it was normal as compared to water-cooler water.<br />I wish it was less costly...won't be drinking 3/day, but that's only due to price.<br />I've read the negative reviews with fascination because my experience is the opposite."
4,"Guilty as charged. I do and have loved white asparagus since babyhood. Instead of white milk on occasions I was fed blended soft white asparagus at room temperature. By my own decree (I was very assertive back then) and later I learned the many gourmet possibilities that exist with this much understated edible. Most people being familiar with the green variety, which is not bad for I do love all things asparagus, that offers different ways of consuming. From raw to steamed to sauces to grill, the possibilities are not limited to either or.<br />Back in the old world the chinese population had a gift for chinese foods. A lot different than the ones here in US, somewhat a cultural blending with south american cuisine influence, they had the famous and much loved chicken rolled in asparagus. Really a highlight every time of the dinner.<br />This one gets a 4 and that is good enough for now for even though it is much appreciated it is not eaten with a lot of frequency or the bathrooms wouldn't be able to take for they do reveal themselves in that most basic of human function, the famous #1. Kind of a strong reminder of what one had for dinner.<br />Enough said and 4 well deserved stars for Roland White Asparagus peeled Spears, 27.8-Ounce Can (Pack of 3)."
4,"I have always loved Lipton teas. It is a daily habit.  I just bought a automatic tea brewer and loose tea for the first time.  Almost immediately I started getting an upset stomach.  It never occured to me that it could be the tea.  I have never had a problem like this.  After a week of stomach problems, and tring different solutions I finally stopped drinking the tea.  Immediately my stomach was better.  A few days later I started drinking the Lipton loose tea again and immediately my stomach was upset.  I looked on the internet and a few suggested I add a bit of honey and a bit of salt.  I tried that with no success.  Does anyone else have any ideas?  I hate to throw out six boxes of tea."
4,"Having tried the Mojito mocktail from Crystal Light I was a little apprehensive to try this because I really didn't like the taste of artificial sweetener.  I'm glad I did give it a chance because this flavor is very similar to the pre-mixed diet margaritas you find in your local liquor store.  My usual go-to margarita mix (which is delicious) is squeezing a few pounds of lemons and limes and adding finely ground sugar and takes at least a half hour to make.  This mix takes less than five minutes and is an okay substitute for the real thing.  It also isn't too syrupy or sugary like other mixes.  I add silver tequila to ice and top it off with this and am quite happy with the flavor."
4,"I bought these crackers on a whim when I was purchasing the pb2 powdered peanut butter. They are not bad for a low fat treat. I am on weight watchers and I am always looking for alternative snacks. They have a strong peanut butter flavor and a little bit of aftertaste though.  I would not purchase them again,I would prefer to make my own using the pb2."
4,"Nutrition/energy bars are an iffy proposition.  Even if it sounds like you might like it, you could easily find yourself biting into something that's a bit like a mixture of sawdust and rubber cement.  Fortunately the Eat, Think, Smile (Odd name, that.) Dark Cherry bar is pretty tasty, though it does suffer from a little bit of dryness.  Nevertheless, it's got a brownie-like quality that I enjoy, and if the cherry flavor isn't as cherry-like as you might hope, it's a small thing, really.  What you've got is a nice, nutty, chewy, cakey bar that has 6 grams of fiber per 200 calorie bar, and 4 grams of protein.  That's not bad, really.<br /><br />What ETS is promoting here is the antioxidant quality of cocoa. I'm as thrilled as the next chocoholic to think that my favorite indulgence might be good for me, but I really don't know how to evaluate the claim that one sort of cocoa is better than another, or that it's all better than green tea, and honestly if you're eating chocolate because you think it'll improve your health, it might be time to reevaluate the rest of your lifestyle.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these bars might be just the thing if you want a fast snack.  They're small; they'll fit easily in a purse or pocket. What more could you want from something that didn't come out of a bakery?"
4,"This product is a perfect substitute for the syrupy, cloying sweetness used in commercial mocha drinks. It makes a very satisfying home-brewed white mocha espresso drink. I buy it by the case if it is affordable.<br /><br />I purchased this recently from DiabeticFriendly LLC, who advertised a case at a great price, with shipping at an appropriate $29.81. Vendor sent me ONE bottle (@$10+ yikes!!! over twice the cost of Lollicup per bottle) and charged the Amazon shipping rate ($29.81)for a case of 12 bottles. When I contacted vendor, he got nasty and accused me of trying to rip HIM off. I had to contact Amazon repeatedly, before the vendor refunded, but the vendor continued to send nasty emails calling me names. Check out his reviews. . .it looks like he blames the customer when they complain about his high shipping charges. As well they should complain, Amazon has set shipping-by-weight that the vendor is required to follow. IF the product is listed correctly by the vendor, then shipping should not be in dispute or excessive. I would never have purchased from this vendor if he had listed the product correctly."
4,"I am gluten free so I am always looking to have grab and go items available.  My kids love these puffs, and so do I.<br /><br />Lots of them for a reasonable calorie count."
4,"I like this dog food for my 2 chihuahuas.  There are many foods out there that make my dogs ""go"" way too often.  And many that make their stool was too runny.  There's also many foods out there that my dogs turn their noses up to or ones that are very enticing to them that make them overeat.  My dogs free feed so that can be a big problem.<br /><br />My dogs have no digestive/stool problems with this food.  They don't turn their noses up to it and they don't overeat.  The variety in the bag is a nice assortment.  This food seems to be a very good option for my dogs and I'd recommend it."
4,"is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it."
4,"We like this espresso from Italy, it is rich and delicious. We get fast shipment, and have no complaints."
4,"I did a lot of research before deciding on this brand. For the price its one of the better choices. My dog doesn't like to eat all his vegatbles and will often leave the carrots on the floor near his bowl, but other than that seems to like it. This isn't one of the dog food's full of filler."
4,"Purchased this due to health benefits, be warned the flavor is bland and watery, like unripen raw pumpkin.<br />Purchased case in March 2010- Cans were slightly dented."
4,"GLORIA JEAN HAZELNUT K-CUPS ARE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE K-CUPS  GAVE AWAY MANY OTHER FLAVORS THAT I DID NOT LIKE  BUT I WILL NOT GIVE THESE AWAY"
4,"I liked the idea of the small popcorn.  It pops up really well in the popper but it doesn't have much if any ""popcorn"" flavor.  Was pretty bummed by that."
4,"One of these in the morning with an apple and I'm off to a good start.<br /><br />I like the Pecan Pie a little more as it goes better with orange juice.  These are a little spicy but a nice convenient healthy snack."
4,"I admit from the start I am not a coffee expert.  I like this.  It is smooth and good tasting.  I use it in my keurig (using a reusable cannister).  I like the flavor.....  not too harsh.<br />recommended!"
4,"I like this bar.  It does have an initial interesting taste, but I'm sure it's the mac nuts in it.  I would buy it again.  It is VERY moist and sticky - which is good cause it won't dry out your mouth like a lot of bars do.  I think I'd like to try other flavors as well.  I let a co-worker try it and she said, ""it tastes like lip gloss"".  I'm not sure how she got that opinion, but thought I'd put that in my review.  It is different from any other bar that I've eaten; sesame seeds, mac nuts, etc."
4,"These Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes are really very tasty, maybe the best I've tried so far but I was surprised to see how small these packages really are. That is entirely my own fault for not paying closer attention to the weight ~ these bags are only 3 ounces each, hardly two servings worth of dried mango per package. Considering the price, they aren't the best value in dried fruit but nevertheless they are still yummy. The pieces are quite small and rather bite-sized. The fruit is very sweet, soft and moist ~ not hard and shoe-leathery like some other dried mango products. They have been organically grown (although it states nowhere on the package that they are unsulphured like other Made In Nature fruits) and they are a product of Mexico or Ecuador.<br /><br />So I give Made In Nature Organic Dried Mangoes, 3-Ounce Bags an overall 4 stars ~ 5 stars for quality, 3 stars for value."
4,"I have a protein shake for breakfast every morning... usually I use powdered protein -- but when Im in a hurry it's good to have a pre-mixed liquid available.  These are pretty good.  I liked that they are organic, not too sweet, and creamy.  The variety pack is nice because you can try the different flavors.  I would have given it a 5 but there was a slight stevia-like after-taste, particularly on the chai that I didn't care fore."
4,"When I was little, my great aunt had been traveling somewhere (can't remember where), and someone gave her a tin of violet mints.  I'm not sure if these are the same brand, but she offered me a few and I've always remembered them. They did come in a little tin and they were round and smooth, as these are.<br /><br />The taste is slightly violet and a little sweet.  In the middle there is a very tiny bit of licorice. It takes a while to get there though. Unless you have teeth like rocks, do not crunch down on these. You have to be patient.<br /><br />I'm glad I found them."
4,"PRO BAR ""fruition"" snack bars have a robust fruity flavor. The sweetness is a natural compound of strawberry, apple and date. I love the fact that this is a vegan snack that has no cholesterol and very low sodium. One of these bars makes an excellent snack and contains only 160 calories.<br /><br />The one flaw is the texture which is not chewy enough. Everything including the oats and cashew nuts has been ground up fine and the result is a rather gluey texture."
4,"Understanding that these are diet Salad Dressings, having no fat, no gluten, no carbs, no sugar, and no calories, will go a long way in forgiving a weaker taste than in their full calorie counter parts.<br /><br />The two flavors we bought (Caesar and Honey Dijon) are good tasting and enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommended!"
4,"..............................U P D A T E...........................<br /><br />TASTE AND QUALITY OF PRODUCT.....5 stars<br />BARGAIN RATING...................0 STARS<br /><br />.<br />.<br />"" W I D A "".........RECENTLY, I bought myself one small bag of (other) potato chips, and one THREE MUSKETTEERS Bar.  I love both of these snacks a LOT, but I wanted to see which I liked best.  The potato chips won, (by a nose) -- and so I must come to the conclusion that potato chips, for good or ill, are my VERY favourite snack, and, (as I think I mention below), I have yet to meet a potato chip I do not like to eat!<br /><br />Also, as mentioned below, these particular potato chips are ESPECIALLY tempting to me, because the gracious living of the Old South, (and also in todays New South, in New England, Old England, India, Sweden, Canada, and wherever kind and hospitable people can be found...which is all over the world), is warming and comforting to me, reminding me that there are STILL outposts of civilzed behaviour, (and manners), all over the world -- and these potato chips, purporting to be of a ""Carolina BBQ variety"", happily remind me of this.  (I am also ""turned off"", (mightily), by the sad, recent trend amongst many people, (also unhappily all over the world), who take a ""who cares?"" attitude, are NOT gracious and do NOT have any<br />manners whatsoever.  Etiquette, (as Letitia Baldridge, former social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, has said), is the art and practice of making OTHER people feel comfortable, and there is NOTHING ""stuffy"" about it.  Too many people today forget this -- and grab, and gab in 4-letter-word language, and stab, by telling dirty, (and worse) ""jokes"" -- and it is a truly sad when people mistake manners for inflexible social stratification, while proceeding, (seemingly of their own free will), to slide down a few levels in civilzed behaviour, taking those with whom they come in contact -- if they are not aware, and prepared to do battle with such attitudes -- sadly along with them.  (II say ""SEEMINGLY of their own free will"", because I know that the unconscious, deadly influence of the mass media has SOMETHING to do with this slide downhill, by so many.  Or at least, some images portrayed by the media intensify this slide.....)<br /><br />At any rate, in my quest for ANY outposts of civilized behaviour, today, the lure of LAY'S TANGY CAROLINA BBQ POTATO CHIPS proved irresistable.  The hot weather often found in the Southern US can bring out the worst -- but also, the best -- in people, and, ever the optimist, I just could NOT pass up this chance to have a real ""taste"" of a sample of what I hoped to be the best the Southern US has to offer.<br /><br />In my main review, below, I mentioned I was NOT going to buy these potato chips because the seller did NOT mention how many bags would arrive.  But, upon taking a second look, I noticed that each bag would weigh a total of 10.5 ounces, and the entire package would weigh 3 pounds.  This would seemingly make for 3...or perhaps 4 bags of potato chips, with the extra weight given for the packaging.  Slightly more expensive than potato chips in the supermarket -- but not by much.  And besides, I had NEVER seen the ""Carolina BBQ"" style of Lay's potato chips in my local store.  These combined circumstances proved irresistable to me -- so I finally decided to buy one unit of these over-whelmingly tempting chips, and see what I could see, (and taste what I could taste.)<br /><br />Well, they arrived this morning.  In a US ""Priority"" Mail box, which presumably would take UP TO three pounds in weight.<br /><br />The box weighed far, far lighter than this.  It did not say ""Potato Chips"" on the outside, so I didn't know what was inside, until I opened the box.  Inside was ONE 10.5 ounce bag of potato chips.  Just ONE!  It was covered with stick-on bubble wrap, to protect the contents -- but also, I suspected, so that I could not easily duplicate my purchase, and send it back for a refund.  (The seller seems to know potato chip afficitionados well -- once we see the bag of p.c.s, it's hard not to open it!)<br /><br />The potato chips inside WERE quite good.  Somewhat like a ""light"" BBQ flavour, with just a small bit of barely-noticable extra sweetening for a different flavour.  But $18.95 (cost plus shipping), for a single bag of potato chips, (with the normal price marked as $3.98, there for me to notice only AFTER I had opened the bag)?  NEVER again!<br /><br />I could easily put all the blame here on a perhaps-far-too-greedy seller -- but, to be totally honest, I cannot.  I had sadly forgotten the fact that ANY seller can be contacted, before purchasing anything, through Amazon itself.  For those items NOT sold by Amazon, but through a third party, (as these potato chips were), all one need do is click on the seller's name, and see his or her ""store-front"" revealed.  This ""store-front"" page lists many things...including satisfaction ratings by customers -- AND A LINK TO CONTACT THE SELLER!  This link is sometimes difficult to find -- but it is ALWAYS there.  All I had to do, in this instance, was contact the seller, and inquire of him or her just HOW MANY bags of potato chips were actually contained in any one shipment.  I have contacted sellers before -- but totally forgot in this instance, for which I have only myself to blame.  Hopefully, though, this part of my review will help other buyers who have questions about products sold by third parties, to more easily ask questions of sellers. This said, (and my own inadequicy admitted), I still think that puting only ONE 10.5 ounce bag of potato chips into a carton stated to be of three pounds in weight, is a rather unsavoury selling tactic.  By my calculations, the seller here has made over a 300% profit -- at my expense.  (It would be a 600% profit, but I am not here counting shipping and handling charges.)<br /><br />I begin to wonder if the seller has some connections with the I.R.S.?  (Only kidding here, I.R.S.!) Yet I must admit, though the seller perhaps, should be taught the meaning of ""usury"", for his higher-than high profit on my purchase, I also must admit that I forgot the most rudimentary of buyer resources.  When In Doubt -- Ask.  Or -- W. I. D. A.!<br />.<br />.<br /><br />................O R I G I N A L.......R E V I E W...............<br /><br />...As a Northerner who yet yearns for the grace and polish of the Old South, (which can also be found, even today, anywhere civilized people comport themselves -- including, (in great numbers), people living the modern South, and hospitable places such as New England, Old England, India, Sweden and Canada, (but also, in smaller numbers, perhaps, in other places all over the world), and yet ever-mindful of the fact that the Confederate Anthemn, ""Dixie"", was actually written in Brooklyn, New York -- where I was born -- I, (being a potato chip affictionado in any event), obviously found the LAY'S TANGY CAROLINA BBQ FLAVOURED POTATO CHIPS -- 10.5 oz -- herein offered -- totally and absolutely irresistable.  Yet, I will resist (!)  Why?  The price given is $9.95.  Plus $8.95 shipping.  The NUMBER OF BAGS IS N_O_T GIVEN!  Will I then be paying close to $20.00 for 10.5 ounces, (one bag) of potato chips????  As the number of 10.5 ounce bags is, as I have mentioned, not included in the description, I very well could be doing just this, should I decide to buy.  For this reason, (and for this reason only), have I sadly decided not to. I have yet to meet a potato chip I do not like...and so I will chose another.  Maybe not as tasty, but tasty enough.  Any extra money I will save will go for ""the taste of freedom"", and my favourite political party!  PLEASE state the NUMBER of bags included in ordering these wonderful, southern-style potato-chips, in future!  Thank you!<br />Hopefully,"
4,"You can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall.<br /><br />This is higher quality dog food. I know you may not care, but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life.<br /><br />I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.<br /><br />Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots."
4,"I've had better five spice powder, but those cost twice as much as this. At this price point, I think this is a great deal."
4,"My husband drinks energy drinks nearly every day, so I'm always looking for a good deal.  These were on the Friday Sale, so I ordered a two-pack.  It's an ok deal, but if you watch sales, you can find them about the same price elsewhere.<br /><br />I do like having them shipped to me.  That's nice.  Packaging could be a little better, but that feedback was left in the appropriate place.  I just wish that it hadn't taken twice as long as any other product I have ordered with the Super Saver shipping.  I know that it came well within the aloted time, and I know that they said it takes a few extra days, but I'm spoiled with Amazon's amazingly fast shipping.  We had run out at home, and I was hoping to not have to make the shopping trip.<br /><br />In the end, my husband was quite happy to come home to a fresh 24 pack waiting for him on the doorstep."
4,"I have a soft spot for this coffee.<br />As mentioned before, it has no subtlety, and you won't be picking-out notes of blackcurrant or orange blossom or whatever - this is highly roasted stuff that just tastes of strong, strong coffee. I've had plenty of supermarket coffees in the past that were terrible due to being over-roasted to death (perhaps to disguise rubbish beans). Somehow this Costco Rwandan one works though, as a straightforward rich, bitter coffee. It's so charred that when I put it in my hand-grinder the beans just kind of shattered, giving no resistance.<br />Its main selling selling point for me is that it works nicely as a robust espresso (in my Solis Crema SL90), and as a punchy filter-coffee.<br />PS it's cheap.<br />Mmm."
4,"I tried the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee the day it arrived. I really love the individual coffee ""pod"" that is so handy and easy to dispose of. The directions suggest using one coffee pod to make an eight ounce cup of coffee. This makes a good cup of coffee with no messy coffee grounds."
4,"I have a 100 lb lab/weim mix who is a little over 2 years old. He has allergies that have progressively gotten worse as he has aged. I haven't had him tested yet but it is clear he cannot eat anything with oats, corn, and even potatoes seem to trigger allergies. His allergies are most commonly seen as stinky, black yeasty ears but he also will get patches on his skin that he chews on continuously, mostly around his feet/legs and dry skin - since he is black it is very obvious when his skin flakes - and hair. Vets haven't helped much besides giving me products to clean his ears - which didn't work! I've tried Dr E's Grain and Potato Free Limited Ingredient Buffalo (cleared his ears up but he hated it and I kept having to put other food in it. Arcana Pacifica - smells just like fish but his ears get worse and his skin flakes more (I think the potato?), Grandma Lucy's Grain Free Chicken - he loves this but his ears get worse; Wells Earthborn Holistic Primitive Natural Grain Free - got bad ears and horrible HORRIBLE dry skin flakes, he looked practically gray.  Prior to this his allergies really flaring up he mostly ate Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Chicken.<br /><br />Anywhoo - with this his ears are still runny but not as bad as usual (his right ear gets really bad but his left ear has hardly any stuff in it when I clean them almost daily) and his dry skin flakes have almost gone BUT he's been licking sores into his legs so clearly there is still something in this he is reacting to. I've started adding in Dr E's potato and grain free duck formula and his ears have gotten better but since his legs look worse so we won't continue on this. The only thing I can think is the alfalfa meal? because the Dr E's has tapioca and he never had a problem with that though I do know some dogs are allergic to that. Or perhaps the chicken? so frustrating and sad for my dog with trying to figure this out. He eats less of this then he had other foods and he isn't getting underweight (as he seemed to when he ate the Buffalo he hated) but his breath really smells on this. badly! so we won't be re-purchasing and the search continues.<br /><br />otherwise it came in a timely manner and was as described. if it had worked I would have continued with the subscribe and save, it is a nice savings. the local independent pet store here carries it but for a much higher price point."
4,"This is not chicken noodle soup. It has no chicken flavor because its not supposed to taste anything like chicken... its CHINESE noodle soup.  Chinese. Asian.  Says so right on the page.  Goodness people, if you want Dr. McDougall's (vegan)CHICKEN noodle soup go get that instead.."
4,"This tea has a very nice peppermint flavor, it is just a little bit too strong for me. It's easy to brew and smells fantastic. The package contains 20 tea bags which will last me a decent amount of time."
4,"I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me."
4,"I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.  I also found that the can needed to be bigger as I wanted more at the end!"
4,"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix is a dry mixture of ginger, honey & natural lemon flavor, packaged in foil pouches. It dissolves quickly & completely in hot water. I added one packet to an 8 oz. mug of hot water. Wow! the ginger was spicy! It was perfectly sweetened with a hint of lemon.  My Indian friend who  loves ginger thought it was too gingery & too sweet.  After she added twice as much hot water to her drink, she thought it was perfect.<br />The directions state: ""You can control the depth of favor by how much (mix) you add to your cup.""<br /><br />If you love ginger, you'll probably enjoy this beverage mix. And, like my Indian friend, you also might get more than one serving from each foil pouch."
4,"I've tried two varieties of Izze's natural sparkling juice, including this one.  It's a great drink - refreshing, fresh-tasting and just the right amount of fizz and flavor.  It's best served over ice or as a mixer with alcohol.  I've made great apple/white wine spritzers with it.  I'm a big fan of Jones' Sodas green apple flavor, though it tends to be cloying and far too strong.  This gets the mix just right - plenty of apple flavor, but not too sweet.<br /><br />This product is 70% fruit juice with the bulk of the rest of its content being sparkling water, although there are some vitamins thrown in the mix.  So: no added sugar or high fructose corn syrup.  Unfortunately, the cans contain a scant 8.4 ounces of drink, and at about a buck a pop, they're pretty expensive.  I can't see myself drinking them by themselves, though I would (and will) certainly use them for mixed drinks.  Some mention should be made that some of the profits from sales go to charity, which is a worthy thing."
4,"Stash has spoiled me for Twinings English Breakfast, which now seems bland by comparison. Stash E.B. has a heartier, more interesting taste."
4,"Muddy bears are an excellent movie candy.  They are gummy bears covered in chocolate.  It's not the most fabulous chocolate in the world, but they make for a great treat and do taste quite good.  As you can currently only get them in theatres, it's nice to have something different at home.  Try them out!"
4,"I have been eating this soup for several years. It is very good and I like the Tomato as well."
4,"The omnipresent Dona Maria mole has a stronger cocoa flavor but I like this one better.  I boil a chicken and use the broth to thin the sauce.  I char 3 flour tortillas on my stove and make crumbs that add a smokey taste to the sauce. I also puree a 28 ounce can of tomatoes and add to the sauce.  Learned from my neighbor who was raised in Mexico. Bone the chicken and add to the sauce.  Serve over rice or wrap in warm tortillas.  Would buy again over the Dona Maria brand if it becomes available."
4,"These are hard dog biscuit treats (like MilkBones) in a square shape about 1.5"" on each side and 1/4"" thick.  So for a small dog, they're pretty big. I tried to break it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn't about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as-is. This is the only reason I'm deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.<br /><br />We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats - especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It's like she can't remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she'll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.<br /><br />So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I'm going to give her the real treat - usually some kind of jerky - but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that's a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.<br /><br />In Amazon's 6 pack it breaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It's more expensive than treats I'd find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It's way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can't compare the two and this will not replace my dog's duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal."
4,"My dogs loved these treats, but they are little expensive for no more than they give you."
4,"I'm not sure I'd go to the store specifically to buy this drink, but that said, it's the sort of fruity drink perfect for a tall glass, lots of ice, and a good book. There is a slight ""diet"" taste to it, but that could be because I'm not watering it down enough and therefore it's a bit ""strong.""<br /><br />It's a great drink to accompany a long catch-up conversation with a friend or sit by yourself next to a pool. Either way though, I keep picturing it as a summer drink. I can't imagine it being quite so refreshing if you're wrapped up in a quilt huddling by a fire.<br /><br />The little to-go pack took me a while to figure out how to open. That cut they put in it almost looked like a mistake rather than the way you're actually supposed to open the thing.<br /><br />Watering it down might spread out the taste a bit. I'm more of a raspberry/blueberry sort of girl, but this is a pleasant diversion. If you like green tea you should give this a shot."
4,"Overall, I am very happy with this drawer.  It is nice and sturdy, and fits under the full-size Keurig machine with no signs of buckling, etc. from the weight of the machine.  There is enough room left over on the top of the drawer for me to put the sugar canister beside the Keurig.<br /><br />I was really hoping to clear up some counter space with this, by having the k-cups stored beneath the Keurig, instead of in a rack beside it.  In the end, however, I wasn't really able to save any counter space, because there is now a lot of wasted space behind the Keurig/drawer.  In order to be able to open and close the Keurig k-cup compartment on the machine with it sitting on the drawer, I had to pull the drawer and Keurig machine closer to the front edge of my counter, so that the k-cup compartment opens in front of the overhead cabinets, because it was hitting the bottom of the cabinet and wouldn't open enough to get a k-cup in there with the drawer pushed back against the wall!  Unfortunately, I have overhead cabinets over all my counters, so there is no way around this for me.  If your Keurig sits on an island counter, or other surface without a low-hanging overhead cabinet, this probably wouldn't be a problem for you... but to be safe, I'd measure how much clearance you have above your machine (with the k-cup compartment open) and subtract about 3.5 inches from that space for the drawer."
4,"My cat loves Newman's Own Organic Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats!  She had a picky eating problem and I simply could not find the right food that she would eat regularly.  After trying about 8 brands of cat food I finally landed on Newman's Own.  My cat, Souxsie has never looked better and even her vet has remarked how well Souxsie looks and how perky her behavior is.  Souxsie is 18 years old!"
4,"This item is labeled as ""NS"" (or No Stir) which means it should not separate. The item which arrives is not a ""No Stir"" almond butter.<br /><br />Other than the separation, this Almond butter is quite tasty."
4,"This is a GREAT alternative to peanutbutter for those watching fat, carbs or calories.  Comparing 190 calories for 2 TBLS to 15 calories for PB2, is unbelievable.  I've even bought this as a gift for ladies working to slim down before weddings.  My husband can add as much as he cares to his protein shakes and I mix it for an apple dip.  I tastes like peanutbutter, because IT IS.  They have just pressed the fat out.  Definite staple for the shelf.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I like the PBS chocolate powdered peanut butter even better."
4,"We really like the Special K Vanilla Almond and Cinnamon Pecan Cereals.  They have been the only cereal we have purchase lately.  I especially enjoyed the cinnamon pecan flavor.  I recently tried the Multigrain Oats and Honey flavor.  I like it even better. Good flavor. Stays crispier. The flakes don't get as soggy the other two varieties. I will buy the Multigrain Oats and Honey cereal again."
4,"These are definitely ""MINI"".  I guess I wasn't really paying attention when I ordered them, bc it looks like hamster food.  My dog still loves it.  I usually grab a small handful and throw them in her bowl.  She never complains.  that being said, here is my review from another order from this dog treat line.  It still applies to this product!<br />I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again."
4,"I have a six-quart whirley pop, and these packs say they make six quarts of popcorn - perfect, right? Not so much - I find that they make too much - by the time it's all popped, the popcorn is crushed a little bit because of how it's being compressed in the popper - if they offered a 4 or 5 quart version, I'd get that instead. Other than that, though - the popcorn tastes awesome, just like the movie theater.<br /><br />Pro tip: at Sam's Club you can buy a big (2 pound) container of Act II buttery popcorn salt for less than $4. It's just like the popcorn salt that comes in these packs - I add a teaspoon to the popper anytime I pop corn without these packs, and it definitely helps. Adds a yellow color too."
4,"I've ordered this selection of Kcups twice.  Very pleased with the selection.  A great way to try 35 different flavors.  I don't see a problem with the paper bag they are shipped in.  The cups go right into my carousel anyway."
4,"First, I have to say that when I got this product, my kids were quite excited.  They love anything with cheese in it so that was a plus from the beginning.  The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.<br />Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.  The kids loved it, of course...it's CHEESY!  It wasn't bad for my taste buds either.  I was thinking that if I make this again, I might just add my own fresh broccoli florets near the end instead of the freeze-dried packet.<br />The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit was a hit with the kids...I'd just leave the word ""broccoli"" out of it."
4,"Just the shaking of the bag and they come running.  I call it ""Kitty Crack""...and I am currently feeding about 19 of them.  One of the ways I can trap to spay/neuter them."
4,"This cereal is like a more grown-up version of Apple Jacks, with a roasted peanut taste instead of apple. The cereal consists of cherio-type rounds that have the same little sprinkles on them as Apple Jacks, only with a peanut taste. These sprinkles give the cereal a good, crunchy texture. The peanut taste is very pronounced and peanut lovers will delight in it. I've tried other peanut cereals and none tasted more peanutty than this. A good quality cereal, and the box came with a coupon for the next box on it - which I was happy to use after enjoying the cereal. Also has the usual offering of vitamins and minerals you would expect from a major brand cereal. Recommended!"
4,"i was having problems finding good reasonably priced beans out of season...here they are!"
4,"This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems."
4,"This is a great Chai to go along with the many other spectacular Chai's made by Celestial Seasonings. It is light, and a good drink before bed due to it being decaffeinated. I found this blend to be best with half and half with some light brown sugar to make it nice and creamy. This is a great tea!"
4,"I've been looking for a premium grade herbal tea that would be a good substitute for caffeinated black tea (my favorite has been English breakfast tea)and was pleasantly surprised when I tried this organic tea from Numi. I created my first cup with one tea bag, half-cup mineral water/half-cup organic 2% milk and it had a very pleasing taste.  Its the closest I've come in herbal teas to something that resembles black tea. Coming from the mountains of South Africa, I wondered what unique flavors the terroir in that region lended itself to this tea blend.  The packaging notes that it has vanilla notes, a universally appealing flavor, however, after savoring my first few sips, I detected a slightly fruity, woodsy taste, with a hint of tree bark or cedar.  After traveling over to a website to study this region, I was surprised to find that this mountain is known for its cedar trees.  The region this tea is from is called cedarberg so perhaps that is basis for its western name (I am sure there is a native South African name for this region as well, I just couldn't find it anywhere).  I was so impressed that I went over to Numi's website and found a very interesting story about the brother/sister team who created this company, very inspiring and a fantastic antidote to the major coffee chain stores we now see around every corner."
4,"the product itself is very good-i would definitely recommend this brand. i bought these with subscribe and save because it was so much cheaper to buy them this way (the price at the grocery store is about $1.60 more per can). when they arrived, 5 out of the 12 cans were dented so badly that i didn't feel safe using them. i emailed amazon and explained the trouble-and they sent me a new case for free. 2 cans in the new case were dented, so i might think twice before buying canned items thru amazon grocery again, but i appreciate the good customer service that was provided."
4,"This is the ""jack of all trades"" fertilizer.  I use it on everything.  At this size it is more affordable."
4,"...just be sure to wash each one before you give them to your dog(s) because during its processing, traces of chemicals are still left intact on the rawhides. My dog used to have upset stomach every time I gave him one of these, so I did a little google research and found out some disheartening information as to why he might be getting stomach aches. Otherwise these are great, his stomach no longer gurgles like crazy and he's keen on chewing these more than ever now. Just wash/rinse them with water inside and out and they'll be fine :)"
4,"My husband and I foster Australian Cattle Dogs and own one ourselves. With our most recent litter of puppies they were unable to do any damage to this toy! (That's a huge improvement over some of the other toys we bought them). Once the puppies were gone, I gave it to my destroyer-of-all-toys. After about a month of carrying it around and chewing on it, he has only managed to sever the head of the T-rex, which makes this the champion of toys in our household!<br /><br />I give this toy four stars just because I wouldn't recommend it for every dog-- it's rock hard and can definitely do some damage. If, however, you have a power chewer and are desperate for a toy that won't easily fall apart, I would definitely suggest this product."
4,"My daughter is autistic and allergic to wheat. Texture is VERY important to her. These are crispy, sweet, and only a tiny bit chalky. This is the ONLY gluten-free cookie that she will eat. There's one brand in our health food store (don't know the brand, but it has a Danish crown logo on it) which she chewed and spit out. Kinnikinnick chocolate chip cookies are good, too.<br /><br />And these are about 2/3 the price of the health food store. BONUS!<br /><br />(But best of all is the brownies made with Gluten-Free Mama's Almond Blend flour. Mmm!)"
4,"We recently got this, which seemed great because prior to this we purchased what we had thought to be ""paragon popcorn"" sold by amazon and we got this popcorn called ""snappy"" which really sucked because there were so many hulls, that we decided to buy this after reading the reviews.<br />upside: hardly any hulls<br />downside: the popcorn is very small, and not as tender as I would have thought it to be since the kernels are so small.<br />Overall, this popcorn is better than the one purchased before but I would probably look for something else."
4,"I have acid reflux for couple years.  It does bother me a lot. I have been taken Nexium for long time but doesn't seem to help.<br />A friend told me about this product so I try for a month.  Seems like I don't cough as much as before after I lie down.<br />I feel a lot better."
4,"Chocolate over marshmallow with a soft cookie inside.  Kind of like an Easter marshmallow bunny with a little cookie buried in it.  These are really good, and I guess I can't say much more than that about them. My wife prefers them microwaved for a few seoonds so they are melty and warm (be careful, they expand a lot if you nuke them too long!)."
4,"I found this once in a store but they don't carry it any more. I am so thankful that Amazon.com carrys it. My son says it's his favorite meal."
4,"This sauce is:<br /><br />1. Low in fat (.5 g Sat fat)<br />2. Low in Sugar (3g/serving)<br />3. Very very tasty<br />4. Packaged in hard plastic jars that can be microwaved or put in freezer.<br /><br />The Puttanesca flavor is authentic - with lots of olives and capers in the sauce. Buy this."
4,"I bought these for my daughters birthday cake. They were very easy to put on and looked amazing. Everyone asked where i bought the cake from because it look so good. I recommended these to everyone at the party for an inexpensive way to get an expensive looking product."
4,"After getting somewhat addicted to Starbucks White Mocha Frappe's, I decided I could probably save a lot of money and make my own.  I bought this and Torani's White Chocolate sauce.  I also like mine with a pump of Sugar Free Hazelnut, so I also bought Torani brand through Amazon.<br /><br />For coffee, I bought 2-lb bags for French Roast beans at Costco.  I grind and then make a strong pot of coffee (14 heaping teaspoons per 10 cups of coffee).  After the coffee is made, I pour it into ice cube trays and freeze them.<br /><br />The recipe is to add about 1 ½ cups of milk (I use 1%) in a blender, about two tablespoons of the White Chocolate Frappe mix, one ""squirt"" of the white mocha sauce, and one pump of the SFH.  Last, I add eight coffee ice cubes. I blend it all up, and it makes about 20 oz. of Frappe.<br /><br />Both my wife and I like it as much if not more that Starbucks, and of course it's much cheaper.  By using both our Prime membership and the Amazon Subscribe and Save, it's even less, the supplies are always on the shelf.<br /><br />The only little annoying downside (why I didn't give it five stars) is that the instructions say to add one scoop to make a frappe.  Unfortunately, they don't include a scoop in the bag, nor can I find a definition of a scoop.  So I just experimented until I liked the taste.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NBYPEI"">Torani Original Mocha Sauce, White Chocolate, 16.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RM"">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Hazelnut, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>"
4,"I wanted to learn how to use gluten in making wheat bread, and chose this brand because of the positive reviews I read on Amazon.  The quality is good and seems to work well.<br /><br />I would have loved it if this product came with some recipes and tips."
4,"good deal on the energy drinks. That's the only reason i decided to purchase them through your website and not somewhere else."
4,"I love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. Not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though.. so I wish they had more recipes available. It does taste more ""gluten free"" than some other options out there."
4,"Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough."
4,"I admit it, I've been a bad momma and my 3 year old Yorkie's dental health could be better. After a recommendation from a friend, I went out and got a few of the individually packaged ones just to make sure because my pup is a bit of a snot about what she eats. Much to my surprise, she ran off with her Greenie and hid under the chair so the other dogs couldn't steal it from her! It wasn't until weeks later that I observed the ingredients list. Shock of all shocks, my little carnivore is totally into these and there isn't a HINT of any sort of meat in them. Other treats have been snubbed, biscuits go uneaten and the money we spent on treats is invariably NOT worth it. Greenies changed that completely!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the steep price. I'm grateful to have such a little dog because I get more bang for my buck, but they're worth it. And it's probably much wiser to buy them here in bulk for a dog who's getting them daily. The vet also says these are pretty high in calories, but as our dog is 3 pounds and doesn't eat much anyway, I think these suit her well."
4,"The mango flavor is good but not necessarily five pounds worth of eating. The 12 flavor variety bag or even the orange only bag are better options than this unless you love the flavor. I disagree with the others saying that these are terrible but the fact is that they're not on the same level as some of the other flavors."
4,"The concept of the ""Portion Pack"" is great. Great Northern has great Popcorn!! really the only issue I had was the sheer amount of salt!!! Yes, I took into consideration my normal No Salt lifestyle and leaned to the salt Connoisseur's taste, Yet even still!! Wow!! too much salt!!<br /><br />Hey Great Northern!! Can you make a Low Sodium Portion Pack???? Please!!!"
4,"I had an earl grey green tea that I'd fallen madly in love with, and I discovered this candy while trying to recreate that experience without the caffeine that sets me vibrating.<br /><br />The candies come in attractive packaging with stickers and details that are designed to lend it a bit of charm and authenticity.  Delivery was prompt, and as you might expect, these smell lovely right out of the box.<br /><br />They do taste a bit like perfume, if perfume tasted good. They do not taste like Earl Grey, but they never claimed to.  I passed them around the office and the other tea drinkers were excited to try them.  Thoughtful head nods went all around, and the official, unanimous verdict was, ""Very interesting.""  I'm glad we got to try them, but I don't think it's an instant addiction.  I also don't think they taste at all like burnt sugar!  Just standard sugar and flavoring.<br /><br />They can be sucked on as a hard candy or chewed.  They're just at that point between brittle and soft that reminds me of that old bazooka gum, except of course these don't become bubble gum once you soften them up enough.<br /><br />I tried dissolving them in green tea and got candy-flavored tea that still didn't taste like sweetened earl grey.  Again, not something the seller ever claimed, but I suspect a few more earl grey fans will wander over to this candy in curiosity!<br /><br />I'm not madly, wildly in passionate love with this candy, but it's pleasant and interesting, and I'm glad I tried it.  I may try violet and other flavors in the future.  You only live once!"
4,"I enjoy these Krinkle Sticks. Before ordering I was a little worried but they taste very good.<br /><br />I am a big time snacker but I needed a healthier choice. I read the reviews and ordered a box. The bag was definitely packed with enough sticks not to feel deprived. I felt the saltiness was just right.<br /><br />Of course it's not like eating those high calorie high fat chips but it's a good enough substitute for me."
4,"This honey is great.I use at in tea 2 teaspoon every day in my  coffee.I also use at in my face as mask. It make you face smooth.It is good for you acne.I found t works great for cold sores. I often get at every month.It is really wonderful product  manuka honey.I didn't use at that often to see many result. I will keep updating.This is wonderful product. I would recommend to others. It has many great benefits."
4,"well it's a fave thing for my bf.. but i guess its a lil too small for a big KID like him..<br />ITS A GOOD BUY THOUGH!"
4,"WOW again!  This coffee is quite strong.  My husband and I drink our coffee black, and I usually drink 2-3 cups per day.  But this coffee is almost like drinking expresso. If you are looking for a dark, rich, very strong coffee, this one's for you.  Those who add sweetener and cream might also enjoy this wake up coffee.  Double Black.... perfect name.  However, I can only drink one cup a day of this brand."
4,"I was so happy to find these on Amazon.com. I love these things but can't find them anywhere anymore. They used to sell them at a store that was right across my house but one day they just stopped! I loved them, but they did taste a bit different that what I had before and the bags were smaller than I thought they'd be(though I've never been good with measurements) but they still tasted great and it was hard not to eat them all in one setting lol..."
4,"I was really looking forward to the apple cider when I got my Keurig coffee pot but I found it to be a bit weaker than I thought it would be. I even checked every local store before buying this 24 pack on Amazon.<br /><br />I will say that I am glad that I tried it, but it wasn't what I thought it would be, though that's not to say it was bad either.<br /><br />I will be more than happy to drink this whole box of my cider, but I don't know if I will have an urge to purchase this again or not. I think I may stay with simply putting a packet of Alpine cider (those ones that can be found at most stores in the coffee, tea, and hot chocolate section) and just running some water through my coffee pot instead. It'll be a fraction of the cost personally as I can get 12 boxes with 10 packs each (120 packs all together) for about $10 through amazon, which is a lot cheaper for my wallet."
4,"The chocolates consist of little raisins covered with bittersweet chocolate. The chocolate is very good, and raisins do add a little more sweetness, so overall, it is very nice.<br />Please, make note that those are not real black currants covered with chocolate as Ribus nigrum, small tart European berry, but little raisins, that are also sometimes called black currants for some reason. I would greatly prefer to have the real black currants covered in chocolate, but those are still good, so they get 4 stars for that."
4,"Overall the flavor of these is excellent.  They are actually a bit denser and dryer then expected, but not enough so to make them less enjoyable for me.<br /><br />But, I can't quite give them five stars.  The first bite, I very much enjoyed both the saltiness and smokiness of the beef stick.  But by the time I finished, the smoke flavor and saltiness had became slightly overpowering.  I may cut them into half sticks to be honest, a half a stick as a snack is about right given the smoke flavor and saltiness for me.<br /><br />Having said that, if you like a STRONG natural smoke flavor and/or like things very salty, then consider this a five star review.  As much as I did enjoy this sausage in small doses, I'd rate their jerky products a bit higher, most or all I've tried I've rated five stars.  Still, if you do like a very strong smokey flavor, again this is the product for you.<br /><br />As an aside, this company has always given me free samples of various flavors of their country cut jerky line, and this time also a free sample of a new flavor, ""maple-peppered"".  The maple-pepper flavor was excellent, the mix of the two worked well.  I'd probably rate the new flavor 5 stars, and next time I order from them I'll see if they have the new flavor ready to order.  Customer service has always been excellent as well.  This is a wonderful company to order from, and even the product I liked the least I rated four stars.  The ones I liked the most, five stars easily."
4,"NOT TO SHABBY SINCE EGGPLANT IS ONLY AN EASTERN VEGETABLE. THANK GOODNESS SOMEONE RECOGNIZES THIS TASTEFUL VEGGIE. UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS LITTLE NUTRITIONAL VALUE.<br /><br />NOW IF WALMART WOULD CARRY CAMBLE SOUP---PEPPER POT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"For what it's designed for it's okay.  No comparison to the real stuff.  Absolutely no comparison to real 100% Kona Coffee from watsonkabeicoffee.com in Hawaii.<br /><br />My kid likes it for the portability on the road.  So for what it is designed for it suffices."
4,"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  There are some great suggestions mentioned by other reviewers, like mint for example."
4,"I ordered this product in Sept. 2010.  I enjoyed this product very much.  I was introduced to Horchata through my aide who is from El Salvador.  I went to a BBQ and they had me try it.  I loved it so much I searched online and found this.  The first couple of boxes were excellent.  I have 1 open container in the fridge now.  I went to have some and it seems as though it fermented or just plain went bad.  I looked on the container and the best by date says  May 2011.  I have like 2 containers left, not open.  I'm afraid to try them."
4,"We enjoy using this product by adding to our breakfast cereal.  However, we would be happier if it were organic."
4,"It's  a great gluten free snack to have with you when you don't know what's available for you in the ""gluten free""  zone.  Some restaurants have gluten free food, some don't. At least you won't go hungry.  It's a delicious power bar snack.  Easy to have with you and much more affordable to buy online than in the store."
4,"I wish the local markets would carry this awesome product! I have ordered it several times and will keep on ordering it because you can't have enough turkey gravy. :)"
4,"These are really tasty!  I got the 6 type combo pack, which had plain sea salt, vinegar, cheddar, honey mustard and onion, jalepeno and honey barbeque.  The honey barbeque, honey mustard and onion and cheddar are my favorites!  These are similar in texture to the Andy Capp's Hot Fries.  I've lost over 80 lbs and am always on a lookout for low cal, yummy snacks and these fit the bill.  My kids really like these too and I don't feel bad letting them have them because they don't have a lot of fat or calories.  I would like to try the cinnamon ones soon!"
4,"Not bad but a little too bitter for our taste. Enjoy Coffee People extra Bold better."
4,"It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.  That being said, I thought the flavor was good, nothing that blew me out of the water, but it was pleasant.  My first 2 cups weren't really strong enough for my liking.  I think I will try using a bit less water next time.  Overall, I love the aroma.  This product is organic and fair trade certified.  They also claim to be grown on a biodiverse farm, with workers who are treated ethically, and through sustainable cultivation...all good points for me.  Each pod is individually packaged which seals in freshness."
4,"I have a 75lb, 10 year old Doberman-Weimaraner mix. He's been having slight joint issues that I've noticed lately. He's stiff walking around, having a bit of difficulty with the stairs & getting into the car.<br /><br />The main draw for me was the Glucosamine. I've been looking for a product safe to give a dog for the while and liked the sound of GreenDog. I've been sprinkling 1 teaspoon on his food once a day for the past two weeks. (The directions list a bit more for his size, but I'd rather err on the side of caution.) It's difficult to say how effective a product is from only two weeks of use, but he doesn't seem to mind it on his food. He doesn't go crazy for it either; rather he seems to not mind either way.<br /><br />I was very surprised by the very herb-y smell! I almost hesitated to give it to him (it certainly smells more like human food than dog food) & took another look at the ingredients.<br />The ingredients listed:<br />Gluosamine HCI (shellfish source)<br />Proprietary Organic Antioxidant Blend (organic algae meal, organic alfalfa)<br />Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)<br />Proprietary Joint Comfort Blend (Meadowsweet, Bromelain, Stinging Nettle tops, Ginger, Tumeric<br />Green Lipped Mussel Extract<br />Proprietary Ocean-source Omega Blend<br />(Wild salmon, cod, tuna oil)<br />Inactive ingredients (Cinnamon, cloves, natural sweet salmon flavor, organic flax, silica, sprouted barley malt)<br /><br />He's seemed a bit more playful lately. Though I'm not positive this was a result of the GreenDog Motion Powder I'm certainly not ruling it out. Overall, I will recommend this to friends with older dogs. I do encourage anyone to consult their veterinarian of course. If he shows improvement I'm more than happy to order more of the Motion Powder."
4,"Nice selection of coffee but too many decaf cups. I was just looking for a mix of coffe with no decaf or flavored coffee cups"
4,"Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, 5.3-Ounce (Pack of 6) These are tasty; however they have no nutritional value and unless you use them as a lunch time snack they can be costly. If you open the pack it is hard to eat just one bag as a serving. This is a four stars product.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts per serving:<br />Serving size-1 pack(30g); Calories -130; Fat Calories-25<br />Total Fat-3gram; Sat Fat- 2.5g; Trans/Poly/Mono Fat - 0g<br />Cholest - 0g; Sodium - 190 mg; Potassium - 30mg<br />Total Carbs - 24 grams; Fiber - &lt;1g; Sugars - 18 grams; Protein - 1 gram  MORE sugars then anything but it tastes good."
4,"I luuuuuv to chew on wax lips - and so do my grandchildren.  But they're so hard to find in stores.  Now I can get them online.  Thanks!"
4,"Delicious coffee. That being said, it really isn't worth the money.  I don't know why the Black Silk is more expensive than the Folgers Columbian.  The Donut House coffee is equally as good as the Black Silk and costs much less."
4,"This has a great chocolately taste, but it doesn't mix well in milk.  Tastes great on ice cream though."
4,"Quaker Oats Company has been around for over 100 years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good. As a matter of fact, that's what I like about them being singly packaged, it keeps me from going back for more!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins)"
4,"Our first taste of Super Veggie made my wife and I reminiscent of a Bloody Mary. So much so, that we squeezed some lime in along with black pepper, a dash of celery seed and tabasco. No alcohol though, so I guess it would be considered a Virgin Mary! It was delicious and now we have one each evening.<br /><br />I have been drinking V8 Lower Sodium for quite a few years and have recently switched to Super Veggie for the additional health qualities. When compared to V8, it seems to be superior in every aspect. Super Veggie has a lot less sodium, higher fiber, less tomato and more of the other juices. I feel that it is more comparable to an actual serving of vegetables than V8. I'm very happy with this product.<br /><br />I gave Super Veggie 4 stars because it is 3 times as expensive as V8. I have calculated that I pay about 15 cents an ounce for Super Veggie, and a little less than 5 cents an ounce for V8. Don't get me wrong, Super Veggie is worth it. I think the health benefits make this product a dietary necessity. I just wish it was a little more affordable."
4,"Wonderful!!You need to know that this is made with a lot of Ginger flavoring.  You taste a lot of ginger and then a few seconds after to swallow it, then you taste the spice. It's very unusual, but very good....<br />I'm so glad that we could find it on Amazon because I was about ready to give you hope of ever finding it again... Thank you Amazon.com for Having the Kitchens of India brands of food!"
4,"I am cannot say anything good or bad. My dogs all time favorite treat is a dingo, but THESE looked different and said ""Dental bone"" SO I thought they would be different but they are just a normal dingo with different writing on the package"
4,"...or like salty Cheerios.  You can taste the sweet potato in the chip but the sweet potato flavor made it taste kind of like salty breakfast cereal.  I did like the chips but probably not enough to get them again."
4,"The crisps are awesome. Give me English crisps over american chips any day! I recommend them to everyone. The smoky bacon are my favorite but the cheddar bacon are almost as good."
4,"At first, I was disappointed when I opened the package and found a few of the boxes with noticeable dents and tears.  However, the cereal did not seem affected by the damage to the box.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this item due to its convenience and low price.  And of course its great taste!!"
4,"My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.  The vet said there was nothing wrong and she was probably just eating too fast.  We immediately switched over to this Sensitive Stomach version and the vomiting frequency decreased dramatically.  Now she vomits only once every two or three months.  I'm skeptical that there is anything really different about this food, and it could have just been a coincidence that she stopped vomiting after we switched.  Still, I'd rather just stick with this kind than find out.  I took away one star because it is, in my opinion, unreasonably expensive."
4,"I can't say whether or not this is helping my cats' dental health b/c I don't feed it regularly enough; it's pretty expensive. I will say that it is, however, a very powerful treat for my critters -- they go CRAZY for these, leaping and crying. Other treats don't have this effect. I discovered recently these make good DIY ""pill pockets"". One cat is on a short course of antibiotic and steroid pills and he's impossible to pill by any normal method, so I've been taking a paring knife and boring tiny holes into these treats and stuffing in 1 pill per hole. Pill problem solved! I'm actually buying more in case I need to pill them in the future."
4,"First, let me say that I love this company.  They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose."
4,"a great alternative to Pepsi for my husband as he begins the switch from high fructose corn syrup soda.  You can make it as strong or weak as you'd like.  He is picky but like the taste.  I would love if they made an UNSWEETENED one."
4,"the flavor is excellent.  Most of the pieces in each bag are nice and tender, however a few are pretty tough.  Overall an excellent value.  Price is less than half what my grocery store charges for beef jerky."
4,"This water was crisp, clear and refreshing, I think it may have hydrated me better.  Nice sturdy bottle and a very generous size.  Definitely worth a try !"
4,"Although I prefer Lucaffe Classic, these pods provide a good caffeine kick and good taste at a good price.  The convenience and the wake-up kick make this coffee great in the morning."
4,"When I saw the box of soup I though maybe I should try it, seems fancy or classy or something.  They claim no BPA and the boxes are actually better for leftovers since they re-seal.  I was also happy to find that the soup is pretty good too.  It is not quite as tasty as ""Imagine Organic Creamy Tomato"" which I have since discovered, but it is still really good.  So good that I have stocked up on a six pack."
4,"I love Ghirardelli chocolates: for eating, baking and now for drinking.  This product is an intense, creamy, chocolatey powder mix that you can make using hot water for a rich chocolate drink, or make it with milk for an extra creamy taste.  It's great to take with you when you're away from home (it also comes in pre-measured packets that you can mix into 8oz of hot water), or keep it at work, or in your dorm room for that quick chocolate break.<br /><br />The 32oz packages are very cost-effective.  I keep the powder in a canister on the counter next to my Keurig beverage machine, and it's been hit hard this cold, blustery winter!<br /><br />PLEASE BE ADVISED, if you're expecting this item to contain ground chocolate and cocoa, you need to be looking at the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019SE6M0"">Ghirardelli Chocolate Sweet Ground Chocolate & Cocoa, 3 Pound Can</a> product instead."
4,"Ginger came via USPS quickly. The individually wrapped pieces stay fresh and tasty.<br />The cost of the product is high but inline with other providers.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMEEHE"">The Ginger People Original Ginger Chews, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>"
4,"This is one of my favorite mixes for the holidays.<br />Brings that festive feeling to life as you make it, serve it and drink it.<br />It's one of my favorite treats as well as my family's."
4,"My dog has agility training two days a week, so we are always trying new treats for her to assit in motivating.  We use the Zukes on a semi regular basis.  I like it because it is easy to tear the treats down to smaller sizes to make the product last.  The treat is semi smelly which is good because it helps focus are dog.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars is that my dog is very picky and she will defintilty try harder for certain treats.  She does like the Zukes but  she does respond better to more raw types of meat treats that we get at a specialty dog store."
4,"These things are amazing.  I wish someone would have invented them years ago.  all you do is slip the dogs medicine into the hole and give them the treat.  My dogs never even notice in there.  We use them daily."
4,"I just got my Baby Brezza.  I was a little worried about the recent negative comments about the blades not dropping down into the 'blend' position after steaming.  Guess what?  Mine had the same problem. When I pressed 'Blend' I just got a high whining motor noise and no blender action.  Not willing to give up so easily and play the Returns game I removed the five or six screws from the bottom, popped the top off, and immediately saw the problem.  The problem is that the drive belt had slipped off the blender gear during transit, probably due to the way the Brezza is positioned in the box.  I pushed the drive belt back onto the gear, closed it up, and now the blender works fine.<br /><br />My only complaint now is that it doesn't really puree very well.  We ran a batch of carrots through it and it came out chunky.  There were even several dime-sized pieces that I guess had gotten between the blades and were not chopped up at all.  So like all food processors there is no escape from the 'open the top, scrape down the sides, and blend again' method if you want a true puree.  I did pop the chunky carrots into my mini Cuisinart and (after several scrape/blend cycles) got a fine puree.  One thing my Cuisinart has that the Baby Brezza doesn't is a 'Grind' option that basically runs the blades backwards so that they smash rather than slice.  I think this really helped break up the tiny chunks.  I wish the Brezza had the same."
4,"Okay, there is something I'm not crazy about with this mix: made as directed the batter is too thick, making doughy pancakes. Even when I add extra milk, it quickly thickens up again.<br /><br />BUT, with enough extra milk and cooked before the batter can re-thicken, these really taste as good as regular mixes, better than Whole Foods' ""365"" mix (where egg is optional but you really miss it if it's not there), and 'way better than the recipes we've tried with egg substitutes. This is a blessing for my son who loves pancakes but is allergic to eggs, and for the rest of us who aren't allergic but just love pancakes on a Saturday morning."
4,"I once had a soy chai latte that blew my mind. I was driving through Missoula Montana. I have yearned for years to capture that taste again. I have tried chai after chai with no luck. This chai comes close. If you like spicey chai but without all the sugar and milk in the premixed, this may be your chai."
4,"I love Breathsavers Peppermint, not too bitterly strong and not overpoweringly sweet. My job involves talking a lot, and sometimes, it's inconvenient to be swilling down water every five minutes, and these mints do an excellent job.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars was that about 1/4 of the mints in each of the tins are crushed which is inconvenient."
4,"I was hesitate to buy it because of the bad review I read here but my son really loves milk with strawberry flavor. I used to buy the strawberry flavored milk from PediaSure. However, it's way too sweet and it's not organic. I decided to switch to organic milk since my son is eating better now. So far, Organic valley contains the least sugar compare to other organic milk such as Horizon. Horizon contains about 31g sugars while OV has about 24g. I tried the milk myself before I gave it to my son and I like it. I hate Pediasure although my son loves it but I won't mind to drink OV myself. Although the taste is nice, I hope OV can add even less sugar. 24g sugar is about 6 small packs of sugar. It's still little too much to a young child. However, I believe this is the best organic milk I can find on the market so far. I'm happy my son is drinking his milk every day and enjoys it."
4,"As the title says, this is a good basic cup of coffee.  We feel a little frustrated by the 6 ounce default pour - does anyone still drink coffee in these lilliputian quantities? Still, with a little time spent pressing the ""give me more"" button, we can get a nice full cup of medium bodied coffee. We generally alternate cups between this and Gevalia Vanilla Hazelnut on the weekends."
4,"If you like Sangria, you'll like this frozen spin on an old, sweet wine drink. More for those who don't really like wine. Sip by the pool on a hot day or in front of the fireplace."
4,"Unfortunately, my cats are not fans of the sardine and mackerel pack. The sardine & mackerel has actual chunks of fish, but it seems the cats prefer the flaked tuna and the tuna and whitefish. Amazon sells a tuna-only version of this item, so I decided to stick to what my cats like and keep the tuna-only dinner.<br /><br />The price is comparable to what you will find at your local Wal-Mart. With the added convenience of home delivery with Subscribe and Save, this is a good deal if your cats like the sardine/mackerel dinner."
4,"I started drinking coffee at the age of 2 when my grandpa would sneak me some in my cup. Ever since, I've required milk and sugar in my coffee as that's how I knew coffee. Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K-Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.<br /><br />There are other great brands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along."
4,"This is one of my most favorite Keruig k-cup coffees.  I like tasty, strong coffee, but not too strong."
4,"Cinnamon Oat Clusters:<br />This was yummy plain but fabulous with milk. I think I used almond milk. It is a bit on the sweet side, so I'd not want to eat it every day, but as a treat it's perfect and I enjoyed it very much. The abundance of large clusters make it easy to just eat it dry out of the bag, too.<br /><br />Vanilla Blueberry Clusters:<br />This was less exciting to me, although still okay, and it was marginally less sweet than the cinnamon one. I guess it had more of a cardboard taste. I was expecting something more fruity and there are no dried blueberries at all, just some blueberry puree mixed in."
4,"Octopus in Olive oil tastes great. Vigo has been using bigger pieces which is good but not as good as the little tentacles they once used. I rip open the can and have instant lunch. My buddies think it's a bit weird, but I love it."
4,"Certainly flavorful, but less body than I usually prefer. I think of Italian blend as a bolder, darker coffee. If you're put off by the stronger taste (think Starbucks)of the coffee house blends, this is the brew for you."
4,"I like pickles in vinegar, and those are real tasty. Its hard to find pickles in vinegar in the supermarkets. Ordering them is expensive due to freight, each can is heavy. Amazon price + free shipping makes it a real good buy."
4,"Great Grains Banana Nut Crunch cereal is really very good! Yum! I'm sorry that one reviewer no longer cares for it; but every time I open a new box of this cereal I get a great scent of the banana chips and nuts. It whets my appetite for slightly more than I intended to eat! I like that it has the fiber I need and it has iron, too.<br /><br />The expiration date is always a while off; that's another plus.<br /><br />It does have some fat, sugar, partially hydrogenated sunflower oil and carbs. (Uh-oh! I can't quite give it five stars because of this, in particular the partially hydrogenated sunflower oil.) If you're watching those (or anything else) closely for your diet, look first at the nutrition facts above to see if this cereal will fit into your diet.<br /><br />I have to admit I love this cereal! It's great anytime of the day!"
4,"I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)"
4,"Eating nutritious meals on the go is difficult; eating ""tasty"" nutritious meals is even harder.<br />When I saw this product I was skeptical as to whether it would really taste good or be filling.<br />My thoughts about the product claims:<br />1) A balanced meal featuring chili lime salmon spread, organic crackers, fruit and nut mix etc - I really enjoy the different flavors and textures of the meal - no boring taste here!<br />2) All-natural; 22g protein, 11g fiber and only 410 calories - a good balance of nutrition and calories (much better than fast food!)<br />3) No trans fats; No artificial colors - I appreciate that it is all natural<br />4) Perfect for school lunch, field trips, sports games, road trips, lunch at work or after school - the Go Picnic is easy to tote along to anything you are doing away from home. It is shelf stable and does not need refrigeration which is a big plus!<br /><br />Over all a great product with great taste that is good for you!"
4,"My two kitties love this stuff and buying it by the case makes the cost reasonable to feed high quality food.<br /><br />My older girl sometimes needs it heated in the microwave or some extra water added so that she can eat it.  I also sometimes add a few pieces of kibble to the mix to give her more traction to lick it up.  This would happen with any wet food.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because my latest purchase had many dented cans.  I hope this isn't a trend on amazon's part, but I thought it warranted noting."
4,"I like these with a glass of milk. They have improved the packaging for the shipping and arrived in good shape. I had order some previously that were not packed for shipping very well. They arrived quite crumbly, not this last time so I am getting another order."
4,"I found these to be a tad gummy but think that seems to be the case with most gluten free noodles. Flavor was fine and gave my daughter something new she can eat."
4,"I purchased multiple flavors of the Stevita Stevia drops and was pleasantly surprised. There was no bitter aftertaste and it is indeed very sweet (although I did have to use more than 3 drops to get it as sweet as I like it). The flavor is very mild, sometimes too mild to taste which is a real problem in coffee. I do think some experimenting will take care of that tho :)<br /><br />If you are hesitating, don't. It's worth trying."
4,"I bought this item at the local grocery store for $5.50 for a 9.8 oz jar which would be $16.50 for 3. I absolutely love this sweetener so I checked to see if Amazon offered it. At my surprise:<br /><br />Amazon wants nearly double that for the same amount PLUS over $10.00 in shipping for these 3 small jars!!! I am very disapointed in Amazon for this irresponsible price/shipping for this item and will not purchase this from them until they get their heads out of the clouds and offers this item for a competitive price and free shipping. If they would do this, I would do the subscribe and save option as I use this item every day. I would have given this item 5 stars if it wasn't for Amazon's price/shipping."
4,"The Red Caviar is very fresh and melts in my mouth in the way it is suposed to do.  I don't know how they can improve the packing, the can came all slime.<br /><br />It was send well packed (refrigeration) and it came on a timely manner."
4,"I will say I like only SOME vegetables and this makes it easier for both myself and family to get more of or veggies into daily life, if not always on the dinner plate."
4,"Seems to work reliably and gives measured amount of syrup ... that's good.  But be aware that the pump adds considerable height to the bottle, so that if you store your syrup in the refrigerator like I do, it's a potential problem.  You'll probably have to adjust a shelf to get it to fit."
4,"I really recommend this product. It is well packaged and protected. Also it smells and taste better than I expected!"
4,"****<br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea with Lemongrass & Spearmint has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen  are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as ""smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""lemon, mint"".  The web site also says, ""Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste."" I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Zen gets only four stars.<br />****"
4,"This is probably one of my favorites of all the honey bunches of oats cereals. Unfortunately, there aren't very many bunches, which are the things that make this taste really good. Nonetheless, it's still a great cereal and I will continue to buy it once in a while."
4,"All the Plum Organics pouches are great! This one has 2x the protein compared to the other fruit only pouches and seems to be sufficient to stop th e whining and tears until meal time. One watch out is that this particular variety has very little vitamins and calcium compared to other varieties. So not good if you're using this as a fruit substitute."
4,"Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests."
4,"I have purchased every kind of gf crispy rice ceral trying to find one my daughter would eat. So glad Kellogs finally started making gf Rice Krispies. She eats a bowl almost every day & loves them."
4,"Pedicure dog food is a decently good dog food. Our dogs love the meat and econally priced at twenty-four can package!!! Will buy again!!!!!!"
4,"Most people love peanuts. But, few brands provide quality, natural flavor, roasted just right peanuts. Feridies unsalted Virginia peanuts do. . All natural, no salt and roasted to achieve a great crunchy taste. I will buy more!"
4,"I've been using Swheat Scoop for years - switched from World's Best(which, alas, had too much dust for me.  Swheat Scoop is fine with the cats and doesn't get tracked around as much as some other brands.<br /><br />There is a problem with food moth and other bug infestations in our now hotter summers. Cure: crumple up a few bay leaves in the open litter tray and pop a few in the bag of unused litter.  This also works to protect your herbs, dried beans, grains, etc."
4,"Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars."
4,"My Australian Shepherd puppy loves these things! I was looking for chew treats made specifically for puppies, to avoid giving him something that would harm him, so I purchased these and have been giving them to him since he was about 8 weeks old. They keep him occupied for a solid 30 minutes or so, the only problem with them is that they leave an orangy trail on your carpet and, if your puppy is like mine and uses his paws to hold while he chews, they inevitably get it all over their paws too :-( It's not hard to wash out, just a pain and seems kind of silly to have a dog treat that bleeds orange everywhere if you have neutral colored carpet like me."
4,"Both my 1.5 and 3.5 year olds love these snacks.  They are a bit on the sweet side but no more so than most packaged kid snacks, and the ingredients in this item are pretty straightforward (i.e. not a lot of weird chemicals or fillers), so that makes me feel a bit better.  I also don't give them out all the time.  I tend to use them when I need a snack when we're going out and about.  This also makes sense because they aren't cheap, so to use them all the time at home would be a waste of packaging plastic and money.  I actually discovered these when one child was having a meltdown at Target and I needed something FAST to quell the outbreak and this is what was handy.  After that discovery, I found Amazon to have the best deal in bulk.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/6/2012 - Kids still love these snacks.  I alternate them with other stuff, but especially good size for younger kido.  Not too big."
4,"Upon searching for a dog treat for our labrador puppy who has food allergies, I came upon these Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison treat biscuits. We were already using the same brand of dog food with great success, so when we found out that there were treats with similar make-up & limited ingredients, we gave them a try & they have worked perfectly as a treat alternative to the normal food kibble in between meals & for training. They are just a little bit on the expensive side, but there are very limited options in treats for dogs with food allergies, & these are the best. Just get enough volume to take advantage of free shipping."
4,"My dog, a half Yorkie half Bichon, recently decided to start being picky about her food.  I tried taking it away when she would it etc, but then she'd end up eating only half her food in a day, and after several days of that (and several months of trying other techniques to get her to eat), I gave up and finally switched foods.  She wasn't happy with anything for more than a few days (dried food, that is), so I decided to try Taste of the Wild's salmon and lamb flavors, since they had lower protein and fat content than the other flavors.  She ate both for a few days, then wouldn't eat it, so I started adding a teaspoon of one of Merrick's canned foods (a super moist one), mixing it all together, and now she loves it (thus I'm taking a star away since she wouldn't eat it plain after a few days).  What I liked about this food is that I was able to switch immediately, no transition period, without a glitch (hey, she wouldn't eat the other food, so I didn't have much choice!).  And, bonus points, her stool is, for the first time in her short year long existence, perfect with this food.  It never was before.  So on the stool count alone, I decided to stick with this. It's been a month and she's still eating it - I give her salmon in the morning and lamb at night, I didn't feel right just feeding her fish and no meat, but am switching the two flavors back and forth hoping the variety keeps her going.  So far so good.  Oh, and I'm not noticing the difference in the coat that others have mentioned, but maybe four weeks isn't a long enough time to notice."
4,"When the labled this product ""extra bold"" they were not lying!  So far, it's the only coffee I've used in my Keurig where I changed the size of the cup so that I had more water.<br />Perfect for Monday morning's or travel mugs!  Daily coffee I prefer something not quite so strong.  My housemate added hot water."
4,"The storage container is exactly what I needed.  Optional wall mounting choice  vs stand alone is nice for me.  Saves on counter space."
4,"I ordered this because my husband is from Pennsylvania, which seems like to only place I can find Utz's chips. The only reason this rate 4 stars for our family is because we only seemed to have gotten one bag of the nacho chips, few of the plain or kettle cooked chips, and a TON of the regular bbq or salt and vinegar chips. If it had an even number of bags per product, we could enjoy this more. But overall these are the chips my hubby and kids love."
4,"This sauce is excellent. Medium hot with smoky undertones and a distinctive sweetness. Goes great with a variety of dishes from different ethnic origins.<br />The company that sells it is a different story. No customer service ethic at all. When ordering strongly request good packaging, otherwise you will receive the product broken and the company will not even acknowledge responsibility."
4,"This stuff is very tasty and a great source of protein, but not cheap - even at Amazon prices.<br /><br />Maybe someday they'll genetically engineer turkeys whose meat automatically turns to jerky.  Until then, I guess this'll have to do."
4,"This is a tasty and refreshing beverage. For those on the go, like most of us are these days, it is a valuable supplement to our sometimes neglected daily dietary needs. I take a glass a day, and then try to make good choices at meal times. The big question is; does it work? Does it indeed give you all that your body needs from fruit and veggies? Well, I don't know. If I could be sure that it did, I would raise my rating to five stars. Definitely more palatable than the original V8!"
4,"Wow - this is a lot of turmeric and sealed in a heavy duty plastic bag - non-resealable though.  Has a carry strap but not very functional once the bag is open.  I plan on transferring the powder to a container after I've filled the 1000 oo capsules I bought.  Like any turmeric , will stain orange so take care in handling.  Best deal I found price wise.  I'm not all that up on quality though..."
4,"just what I ordered and in the usual prompt manner"
4,"This Marley Coffee has a beautiful strong aroma before brewing, like fresh ground beans, I am amazed it smells so good and strong then brews up very mild, almost weak, but that sounds like a negative and that's not what I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and have for years and love a strong brew most the time, this coffee is so mild I can drink it plain. I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.  So I give it a four, because it may not be as strong as I like but comes in individual packets so stays fresh, portable for my frequent camping/hiking trips, brews up to a taste that can be sipped plain, and organic with a amazing pre-brew aroma."
4,"Came as advertised but the interior package had broken open and the santas were roaming free in the box.  It is for my child's school project so I haven't tasted them."
4,"The price for these k-cups on Amazon is ludicrous.  They are actually cheaper in a department store paying sales tax."
4,"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!"
4,"Chances are you will be dipping them into something savory enough. The very low sodium content makes this the perfect chip for the healthy conscious. They are not always 2/$4 @ the grocery store, so I thought this large box of 12 was reasonable."
4,"These corn cakes are excellent.  Because they are thin they keep their crispy crunch. If they've gotten a bit less crunchy than you like, they can be easily crisped setting them on the rack in a 200 toaster oven for a couple minutes.  They're great with both sweet and savory spreads; peanutbutter and jam to spicy hummus or cream cheese.  That they are gluten free is a plus for entertaining friends and family with allergies to wheat. Other varieties are also great; particularly the Flax and soy and Cracked Pepper and Lemon."
4,"I have been eating package quick oatmeal for years, and lately the quantity and quality has gotten lower and lower thanks to the corporate bean counters!  After getting sick on some of this stuff, I decided to try some other kind of oatmeal to see if something else is better.  I went to Amazon's web site and found Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats.  This does take longer to cook, but it tastes a lot better than the package quick oatmeal I have been using, and it doesn't make me sick!<br /><br />Now after saying this, I have since then found something that taste even better than Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats, and that is Bob's Red Mill Steel Cut Oats, which is also available at Amazon. The problem with this steel cut oatmeal is that it takes a lot longer to cook than the Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats, ( 40 minutes verses 10 minutes). If you Google ""steel cut oatmeal"", you will find hundreds of great recipes for steel cut oatmeal!<br /><br />Compared to package quick microwave oatmeal, I would give Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats is FIVE STARS.<br /><br />But - I am only giving Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oats FOUR STARS because I feel that Bob's Red Mill Steel Cut Whole Grain Oats is way better, if you have the extra time to cook it."
4,"Let me just out myself from the get-go here--I am a HUGE chocoholic.  I am also an almond lover and eat a small handful of dry roasted, unsalted almonds nearly every day.  So, when I saw dark chocolate cocoa-roasted almonds offered on amazon, it seemed a match made in heaven. :)<br /><br />What surprised me most, I think, about these delicious cocoa-roasted almonds is that they are not over sweet (only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving).  I worried that they would taste like candy and that is not something I need more of (I am already slave enough to the Sweet Monster!).<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise was that the almonds are not salty.  I have hypertension and need to limit my salt so, when the almonds arrived and I reviewed the nutrition label, I was pleased to see that they only have 25 mg of sodium per 1/4 cup serving and that they are made with dry-roasted vs. oil-roasted almonds.<br /><br />In my chocoholic fervor while ordering, I hadn't paid attention to what size cannister the almonds would come in, so I was again pleasantly surprised to find that they came in a generous 11 oz. cannister.<br /><br />I had some friends over last weekend and put out a dish of the almonds on the table.  I lost count of how many times I heard ""Mmm! These are GOOD!"" but I know that the dish was nearly empty when they left."
4,"I finally found a product that my dogs absolutely love. I have tried numerous brands and in several varieties but my dogs never seemed to wait so eagerly to be fed. I have tried all three flavors of this brand but they seem to like the chicken and rice flavor the best. It makes their coats shinier and it gives them a general all around healthier look about them. Now that I've found something they truly enjoy I hope they don't raise the price. A good value, in my opinion."
4,"We are a big cereal family around here and Crunchy Nut golden Honey really hit the spot.<br /><br />Within 72 hours of its arrival the boys and the family polished off the whole box, what wasn't eaten as a breakfast was munched on as a snack.<br /><br />This is a very good sign for a cereal there are plenty of choices out there so often one is the same as the other.  This one is not.<br /><br />Price wise it's a tad iffy.  but if will pay the extra buck for the box your taste buds will thank you."
4,"First off, every cat is different -- so if you suspect your cat is a picky eater, get a little bag before you try and save out on a giant one. All cats are different and it is absurd to rate a product low simply because your cat didn't particularly care for it. Second, of course it has some smell, the primary ingredient is fish meal. Almost any quality cat food will have SOME smell. If it doesn't it's probably not fresh or most of the ingredients are grains (not great for cats) and don't smell.<br /><br />The only downside of this cat food is that it does have some grain content, if you're a cat food purist this will probably deter you from buying this brand -- but you're also likely to spend a bit more (sometimes quite a bit more) on a grain free formula. Otherwise, the product is great. The fish is ethoxiquin free (ethoxiquin is a preservative that has been linked to cancer in high dosages), the chicken is free range/organic, and the 3 of the first 5 ingredients are named meat products (with no by-product). This is a high quality food at a great price. Will your cats survive on cheaper food? Sure. On the other hand, better food will improve their quality of life and can certainly reduce some potential health problems later in their lives."
4,"Knorr gravy, like all other gravies, is rather salty, but when you don't have time to make your own, you learn to sacrifice."
4,"This brand was highly recommended to me for quality.<br />Just beware that this is PORCINE gelatin.<br />If you want the beef gelatin you have to buy the KOSHER one, which amazon also has at about the same price.<br />I didn't realize all this before ordering."
4,"I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.  I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />""...let's get together and feel all right""  Indeed."
4,"I usually buy peppermint tea loose from my local Whole Foods so I haven't used herbal tea bags in a while. This product is very finely balanced to not leave any aftertaste and although I initially though it was a little weak, I've warmed to its more delicate flavor. The tea bags are individually wrapped and like most other herbal teas you can use the bags twice without any noticeable weakening of the drink. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other flavors."
4,"These cookies are delicious, a little messy but have a great taste, my kids also enjoyed them, it is a lunch bag must have."
4,"This popcorn was pretty good although like some of the other reviews read ... about half the seeds popped.  Maybe we'll order again,  but for now we are using the big bags of popcorn and coconut oil that are sold separately.  They pop bigger and nearly all the seeds pop using them."
4,"I have had two or 3 shakes and it has a mild flavor. I like it compared to other smoothies i have tried. It doesnt have that funny after taste."
4,"The Nylabone Healthy Edibles are a great product that Puppy loves. The Lamb and apple flavor is a real treat for her and she really enjoys them."
4,"Good flavor and texture. Individual wrapped, stays fresh for 3 or more months. Flavor chocolate with pecan over cookie base. Wonderful with cookie or tea."
4,"Cheaper to buy in Amazon than in the store around my area. Add rice/noodle to the food to make it last longer. My baby love it. Only wish there come with different varieties in a pack, this will make meal a little more interesting."
4,"I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each.  For breakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts.  They inhale the food in about 2-3 minutes.  This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K"">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.  Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food."
4,"This product seems to be a definite cut above average.  When dumped into water, it dissolves quickly and completely.  Raise the resulting mixture to your lips, and you're in for a treat.  I had the pomegranate flavored mix:  very slightly effervescent, very tasty, mildy sweet with just a touch of tartness.  As with many sports related drinks, the EBOOST comes with a long list of difficult to establish claims.  I can't state that I smashed any personal records after drinking it, but this much is true:  it was pleasant to drink, rested easily in my stomach, and gave me a mild and pleasant boost in energy.  Placebo?  Who knows, and since it felt good, who cares. I liked it better than any of the other drinks that I've tried over time, and if the price is reasonable, will be using more of it."
4,"I bought a Wolfgang Puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites, so I ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it.  This is a classic, medium-roast cup of coffee.  It's very smooth, with no bitterness.  I would say that if you enjoy Donut Shop, Tully's Kona, and Caribou, you will like this blend.  The label is adorable and makes me smile when I pop it in the Keurig each morning."
4,"I support this company, and this product is good. The little boxes are useful at exactly 8 oz... But it's a lot of garbage in the long run, when you could just make your own stock once every couple of months (look up recipe online) and freeze it in ice cube trays then toss them in a freezer bag and pull out what you need. I make super strong broth and just add cubes to plain water or mixed with a little Marigold Swiss Vegetable Bouillon. They're better than the big containers because I don't make soup or use stock *too* often and the big boxes would get opened and go bad before I could use the rest, so this was convenient in that sense, but after the first purchase I thought what the hell am I doing? and started making my own broth."
4,"Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon beverage really is a natural alternative for stomach ailments.  I was having a hellish day with my stomach and this arrived just in time for me.  The beverage does not have an overpowering ginger smell and taste pleasant.  There is no sharp ginger taste so ginger sensitive individuals can drink this.  Only a few sips helped calm my stomach down.  After 30 minutes I was so much better.  I took off one star since this is quite expensive."
4,"Can be a little annoying to cook on a pot because it takes more than the usual 30 minutes of simmering but the quality of the rice is great and 10lb for $15 is a great deal."
4,"This chip is one of our family favorites to dig into chili, guac, or other hearty (meaning thicker) foods.<br />Unfortunately Amazon has taken it off the subscribe-n-save, so off to the local grocery store during sales..."
4,"These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.  I find them sticky, which makes them a bit messy if eaten while hiking or on a road trip.  Everyone I share them with polishes them off quickly.  Personally, when I look at the ingredients in Kind bars I don't have many fantasies that they are particularly healthy.  Honey is sugar.  Fruit and nuts are concentrated calories.  Healthy fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy will do a much better job of ensuring that I get the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that I need. Gluten free might help some folks.  I do not doubt that if you eat little pieces of the bars spaced out over several hours they don't encourage glycemic spiking when compared to a Snickers or some other candy.  Otherwise I simply regard them as a tasty snack that should not be expected to be anything more than that."
4,"While brewing the coffee produced a great, room-filling aroma, I was slightly disappointed with the strength of the brew vs other k-cups I've tried.  Still, a delicious coffee at a great price."
4,"We made this cake for Christmas and EVERYONE raved about how moist, rich and delicious the cake was. Some of our guests even took an extra piece and there were other dessert options available! I would definately use this mix again. I only gave it 4 stars however, because the shipping charge is outrageous and cost almost as much as the mix itself."
4,"Of the organic gummy snacks to choose from my toddler loves these the most.  My husband and I like them too.  They aren't too sweet and they are very soft.  I would have given the item 5 stars, but I had to take one star away because of the price."
4,"This Sauce(more like a dressing, since the off-white product has a texture like ranch dressing) has a definite, strong Jalapeno flavor and kick, and though the heat won't burn, you can definitely feel a slight trace of the heat on your tongue,even after you finish consuming it. At first, I tried this sauce with tortilla chips, and, while it can be used like a salsa, the product is packaged in a bottle shaped like a salad dressing bottle, which suggested that I should try it with vegetables, so I tried dipping baby carrots into it, and found that dipping vegetables is an ideal use for this product. I suppose that it could be used as a salad dressing, but in the quantities that you'd have to use to reasonably coat a salad, it might prove to be too powerful."
4,"Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand."
4,"This coffee is a little strong for me, but with a little bit of sugar, milk and/or creamer it's perfect. I have a cup of this almost every morning!"
4,"I bought these since I love the Mon Cherie and thought they would be similar,they were not .To each his own! There is not allot if cherry and the chocolate quality poor in my opinion.Just a sort of mild cherry filling and not much.the cherries are not whole but puverized.There was also no expiration date to be found on the box and they were oldi believe,the chocolate was turning whiter,but I ate them  regardless. My seller was great! Ottos Hungarian Deli and shipped them right out with my Mon Cheries which are excellent!Check the expiration dates ahead with your seller.Try the Mon cheri if you are a fan of Liquer and cherry."
4,"My only tweak to the super-simple cake recipe on the website was the addition of 1) 1/4 cup high-quality dark chocolate, for a deeper chocolate flavor, and 2) 1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt.  The cake turned out beautifully -- moist and flavorful.  Rice flour in the mix gives the texture a slightly delicate quality, but not so delicate as to cause crumbling. In my experience, gluten-free baking mixes often have a cornmealy, metallic, or milky (whey protein) taste -- none of which I detected here. Highly recommended if you've already tried the major brands (like Bob's Red Mill or Pamela's)."
4,"Although a little bitter, I do like the IZZE sparkling pomegranate carbonated fruit drink.  With a case of 24, I was able to share and get the opinions of friends and co-workers as well.  They noted the bitter taste but one friend mentioned how that could lend itself to be excellent in a mixed drink...come up with your own cool creation.<br /><br />Carbonated fruit drinks are always my favorite. I always mix ginger ale or club soda with my fruit juices.  It's especially great cold.  For me, the 8.4 oz size is perfect.  I tend to waste when I have 10 oz or more.<br /><br />This is something I would definitely buy and I would love to try the other flavors.  In addition, I love that IZZE has partnered w/Global Education Fund to help children around the world. A good drink, great cause...wonderful combination."
4,"This has been one of my dog's favorite treats forever, and she has not complained about them. However, over the last year or so I have noticed that they are softer than they used to be, making them less suitable for helping to keep her teeth. I have expressed this concern to the manufacturer, but so far have not seen any improvement. I do wonder if the extra water is to add weight to the product.<br />This supplier got them to me quickly and at a better price than at the nearest store (25 minutes away) that stocks them, so I think UPS delivery is a greener option than driving to get them."
4,"Smart product, even smarter cat.  For the first couple days we were so happy not to have to force pills down kitty's throat...then she figured out the pills are inside and stopped eating them.  Worth a try tho!"
4,"If you've ever had frosted mini-wheats then this ""Little Bites"" version will already be quite familiar - it's essentially the same thing but smaller. I'm not quite sure what the point is of making mini-wheats even smaller, but it does seem to be a bit easier to scarf down a couple of bowls.<br /><br />I definitely like the taste. It has a cinnemon flavor, which is easily noticable as soon as you open the box, with (what tastes to me like) a hint of vanilla. I suppose this is supposed to mimic a ""cinamon roll"" flavor, but I don't think that's a very accurate description. It's sweet but not too sugary, and it has a very fiberous texture. Overall very pleaseant, except that the mini-wheats tend to quickly soak up the milk which makes it heavy and soggy.<br /><br />The nutrition facts are pretty typical of a cereal like this: 190 calories (w/o the milk), 1 gram of fat, 46 grams of carbs, an assortment of vatamins, etc. It's not bad for you, but it isn't a cereal for the health-nut either. A nice middle-of-the-road cereal which, I assume, will appeal to both children and parents."
4,"I'm not a big fan of the taste. I've tried mixing it with water (as instructed) and with soy milk. It just doesn't taste very good to me, but not bad. For an easy vegan meal replacement, it does the trick, and the price is good. I'll try the vanilla next, as that might mix well with some fruit in the blender."
4,"Love this hot chocolate and I feel it I got this product at a very good price.People should try it it is delicious and so great to have on a cold winter day or anytime is a good time."
4,"The mixer works quite well once the overall jar has been mixed a bit.  It does not work well to initially mix the whole jar.  The bottom nut butter needs to be stirred up and loosened slightly first"
4,"I purchased these Granola Bars because I REALLY LIKE the cereal! (As far as Granola Cereals go in general, some are almost too hard to chew. This Pumpkin Seed Granola cereal is light, crunchy, and tastes great!) However, the Pumpkin Seed Granola bars aren't as good. My hubby seems to enjoy them though."
4,"Of all the gluten free snacks I've tried or my baby he lkes these the most to me they were just okay didnot quite catch the cheese taste. But they where for my son whose is on a GF/CF diet  to him the were a hit."
4,"Nice flavor, even if it is a little more on the sweet side. I usually prefer real barn-burners and extra spicey sauces but I like this one on almost everything. It is especially well suited for soups and stews!"
4,"The oil is pretty thick and scented a bit strong.  Keeps the hair firm and in place - lets you work your hair the way you want it.  It is particularly suitable for people of Asian and African descent who have thicker hair.<br /><br />The bottle itself looks cheap, but dispenses oil pretty well.<br /><br />Be warned that the oil smell is feminine - guys please do not use this.  Tried it on a Friday evening and realized that I need to shampoo before I meet anyone else !"
4,"I'm restricted to gluten-free food products. I've tried other brands when this would disappear off the shelf in my local market. The others were worse than unappealing -- They smelled and tasted like paper mache' paste. So I took to ordering this by the case from my local health food store. I switched to Amazon's subscription to receive it because it costs less per box and I only have to get 4 at a time (I don't have to figure out where to keep 12 boxes).<br /><br />The subscription service is GREAT! You choose how often to receive delivery. When delivery time comes up, you have the option to delay it if you want, and there's no shipping charge. I now receive several items in this manner because it's less expensive and I don't have to worry about them not being on the store shelf when I need them.<br /><br />Case to case, the cereal can be a bit inconsistent, not in flavor but I find I may have to adjust the cooking time a little bit (a difference of seconds) to get the consistency in texture that I like.<br /><br />I DEFINITELY recommend this product and hope I never have need to smell paper mache' in my kitchen again!"
4,"**First time review in Amazon**<br />I thought the space food was great...<br />The freeze dried apples were DELICIOUS!!!  They were extremely good - Crunchy, tasty, sweet apples with a little bit of cinnamon.  I would buy a box of just that.<br /><br />The Ice cream were really good too and really cool/weird/interesting to eat.  They are nearly weightless and rectangular freeze dried ice cream cubes that melt in your mouth and really taste like ice cream when they melt in you mouth.  Pretty cool.<br /><br />The bananas I didn't like that much -- others may like them.  They were too sweet for me.<br /><br />The protein sticks are like little bigger tootsie rolls kind of but a little less sweet and more proteins and vitamins.  But that in no way shape or form did it stop my hunger at anytime...  they are little snacks kind of.  They were good also tasted like chocolate.<br /><br />So if you want to tried Freeze Dried Astronaut food well here is your chance finally  :P  I think you will like the ice creams and LOVE the APPLES."
4,"I generally make my own shakes from Whey Protein powder and add either yogurt (Yoplait vanilla is a favorite) or bananas, then blend it with a hand blender. The pre-mixed protein shakes I have tried are generally not as good. After trying this recovery shake though, containing both casein and whey proteins, I would have to say that it was actually pretty good. It was a little high in carbs (44gr) but I've never been one to worry about those.<br /> A good protein shake overall."
4,"I am in love with everything rose. I wear rose lotion ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087L6T"">Rose Milk Skin Care Lotion - 8 fl oz</a>), I burn rose candles (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00069ZDJS"">Yankee Candle Large 22-Ounce Jar Candle, Fresh Cut Roses</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OEWDH6"">Votivo Aromatic Candle Rush Of Rose</a>), I use rose lip balm (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049XKXRY"">Rose Love Balm (Limited Edition) - 15ml/0.5oz</a>) and I drink rose tea (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017SZTRI"">Teas' Tea Rose Green Unsweetened Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>.) I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this, *rose preserves*, literally preserves made with real rose petals, I couldn't wait to try it. Oh, the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster, I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent, eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles, toast, ice cream, fresh fruit & yogurt, and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet, that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness, even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet, there *is* a definite rose flavor in this, and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently, according to another reviewer who has tried other brands, Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So, while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes, occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I"">American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>, Joelle's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4"">American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>, and Lisey's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO"">American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch, because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact, I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed, I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover, or looking for a unique gift, perhaps a cute and clever new spin on ""a bouquet of roses and a box of candy"", I highly recommend these rose preserves!"
4,"I'm not an on the go dieter.  I work at home and live with someone else who loves unhealthy snacks.  I'm not blaming that person for my lapses of willpower in grabbing for a bad snack instead of a healthy one.  But this product makes it much easier to keep on track.  It's not as filling as a smoothie and the taste is okay.  But I find it to be just sweet enough and you can't get any easier as far as preparation.  As long as I sip on it instead of drink it quickly, it keeps me from getting too hungry between meals or going for chips or candy."
4,"This is a pretty solid alternative to peanut butter. If the instructions on the label are followed, the peanut butter ends up a little more liquid-y than one might expect, but that is easily remedied by adjusting the amount of water. This works well for sandwiches, and is an awful lot less messy than trying to add proper peanut butter to a smoothie. I've not yet tried using it in baking, but it seems like it would be satisfactory, so long as the amount of water is reduced when making the paste."
4,"It is good and soothing to drink. I have not tried it too many times yet. I am sharing with my sister."
4,"I can't find the ""Sugar-Free"" version of this in my local supermarkets. So, hello Amazon! I have been drinking Carnation Instant Breakfast for years, I bet 20 years at least. It mixes easily with milk, even skim milk. However, I have cut back on as much sugar as I can. Now I mix it with Blue Diamond Unsweetened Almond Milk and it doesn't come out as well. I have to slowly pour in the powder while stirring vigorously, and I still get small chunks that won't mix. But at least my blood sugar is down. I was surprised at the amount of sugar in milk!<br />Anyway, it still is the easiest and most satisfying breakfast for weekdays. It keeps me full at least until lunch."
4,"Fine dog food,  would want to give more stars- but I'm going to petfooddirect. With auto ship I pay $15 less for. 35lb bag. Dog food is good- switched from royal canine for my GSD as it got so expensive. I can actually feed her less with this- so obviously better quality."
4,"If I had an unlimited budget I would buy Green Mountain Dark Magic. Since I don't, the Coffee People Jet Fuel is just fine. My husband and I both like really strong coffee and we are happy with this. We also liked the Coffee People Wake-up call, but I think the Jet Fuel is better."
4,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle is the great smell of lilacs, not too strong but very pleasing. Of the three other brands of shampoo I use, this one left my hair fuller and shinier. I thought it was milder and left my scalp as soft as a baby's bottom.<br />I'm not as conversant with the chemicals in this product so I defer to the opinions of the other reviewers on that score, but I personally like the results this shampoo produced."
4,"This bag of brown rice is delicious and cooks up quicker and tastier than the 100% brown rice. I thought it was a bit pricy but good quality for sure. 100% brown rice takes longer to cook up tender but these only has half the brown coating with most  of the whole grain outer layer removed so it doesn't take as long to cook and has a milder flavor without the bitterness of 100% whole brown rice. I still believe these has better nutritional value then 100% white rice. I get mine from an Asian store now which is much cheaper."
4,"I haven't owned a portable fence for horses until now, but I am impressed and liking this product very much. Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. It's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it won't hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I don't think we'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!<br /><br />The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.<br /><br />We're very happy with it's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, I think!"
4,"After reading and hearing so much about truffle oil, I have build up large expectations in my mind. As one of the few remaining, who never had truffle oil before, I did lot of asking around and checking to help me pick correct brand.<br />This one came out as one of the best and I just chose it arbitrarily.<br />I have had it on several pasta and vegetable dishes and it was interesting. Even though both taste and aroma are very intriguing, I have to admit I was expecting more.  Not sure what exactly, just that it does not seem as wildly fantastic as many people are describing.<br /><br />I am sure if I was not hyped up prior to tasting it, my experience of it would have been different, more open minded and less critical.<br /><br />I will be happy to finish the bottle, just that I have to use really only a little bit at a time, as it did have strange metallic taste when I took a sip of it.<br /><br />Obviously I am no truffle expert, this is just my personal opinion.  Once I've had other oils to compare, I will come back and write more about the comparison."
4,"Ok after eating Blair's Death Rain Hot Wing chips this is like eating a cracker. That aside, these are a pretty good chip, especially if you don't like `em hot and spicy. These are tangy, crunchy, and hard to stop eating."
4,"howdy y'all,<br /><br />this is a rather fine, quick meal. i prefer it with sliced, grilled sausage and chuncked chicken breast added, but it is enjoyable on its own. quick to cook, easy to cook ... and it tastes good! [*grin*]<br /><br />rated a FOUR since it does all that i expected _plus_ it tastes better than expected.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee"
4,"My cat was continually getting hot spots after we go a second kitten.  We couldn't figure out what is was.  We eventually ended up trying this food because it was ""Limited Ingredients"".  It worked like a charm, and he didn't have his hotspots coming back.  We figured out it was grain because one morning he drank some milk with Mini-Wheats in it and the next day he got a hotspot after not having one for a while.<br /><br />So if your cat might have a grain allergy definitely try this food. The cats had a problem with it at first but they love it now that they know they aren't getting the other stuff anymore.<br /><br />I took 1 star off for the price, though it is cheaper then going the raw food route, I still feel it's excessive."
4,"I had been waiting for my regular coffee to become available again (Jet City Whole Bean Espresso), when I received one container as a gift and brewed it in my drip coffee maker just as it came out of the package.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee.  I had no real expectations that it would be any good.<br />It was better than most commercial Mainstream coffee, but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />Then I decided to run this ground coffee through my Capresso Conical Burr Grinder (with it set to the finest grind), and lo and behold this coffee was transformed into a pretty damn good cup of coffee. I purchased a pack of 6 and it is the best commercial coffee I have ever used.<br /><br />While I prefer my Whole Bean Jet City, this coffee is far more than just acceptable.<br /><br />So, if your regular coffee is not available, try this one and Grind it on Fine and give it a try.  It will hold you over until your favorite is available and the price was not bad at all."
4,"I like this, but the biggest scent and flavor it has to me is clove.  I find myself thinking, ""mm, I'd like a cup of that clove coffee.""  Good stuff, just more clove than pumpkin."
4,"My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.  We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included ""Dark Extra Bold.""  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups."
4,"I wanted a sugar, artificial color, and aspartame free gum. Spry provided. I'm a heavy chewer and buying gum in blister packs costs a fortune so I was happy to find a gum that came in bulk. The flavor is a nice fruity one, but it does fade fast, which doesn't really bother me that much. My biggest issue is the texture. I ordered both the fresh fruit and the green tea flavor (really does taste like sweet tea, for a little while). I'll chew a piece of gum for ages so long as it doesn't loose texture. The green tea flavor keeps texture well, the fresh fruit flavor gets soft and slimy fairly fast."
4,"I have bought these a few times now, they are really good if you cook them right. I make Veal Parmagian with these. Put them in the fridge overnight, & sautee in olive oil & butter, to brown the outside, then place on a cookie sheet, top with Mozerrella or Manchesco cheese & place in a 450F oven for about 5 min. Top with your homemade pasta gravy, they are delicious! My friends & I absolutely love them!"
4,"It is a very good coffee......but not great!!  However, it is tough to ""argue"" with the value and the freshness of this coffee.  So, we have good coffee with great value; then we also have great coffee as well."
4,"I bought this to compliment my growing Stash Tea collection at the office. Like my friends they expected a sharp lemon taste with this tea however upon trying it you notice the ginger seems to have the stronger taste. I like the tea though - it is a strong tea (former black coffee drinker here) if you let it sit for awhile. Definitely recommend."
4,"I was able to use this in making pancakes, putting it in yogurt and smoothies, and other things with good results.  It is nice to have around for deviled eggs or for the kids' oatmeal.  I do think it could be a little better quality, but overall we liked it, especially for the price with super-saver shipping."
4,"One of the best values in raw honey. We subscribe and save, and this honey from the Florida Everglades is delivered to us every month. My wife uses it in her green tea and also in warm honey water. I spread it on my toast and pizza crust."
4,"This is very good jerky seasoning. I mixed the original with the spicy as I saw recommended, and while it was spicy, my wife was still able to eat it, and even preferred it to the straight Terryiaki flavor (which was also excellent)."
4,"It is so wonderful to have access to chewing gum that doesn't use NutraSweet®/aspartame that it is hard to complain about this gum at all. Even so, there isn't much to complain about. The gum tastes good (if you like Juicy Fruit), and it stays chewable for a couple hours. The only problem is the flavor doesn't last long - maybe a few minutes. I can live with that."
4,"I really liked this soup. With a little pepper and spice you got yourself a fantastic meal.<br /><br />Heads up to an 4HBers out there. This soup does contain potatoes. I wish I knew how much of the cards came from potatoes, but since I wasn't able to tell I stopped eating eat while on my 4HB diet. It's a good off-day snack though! :)"
4,"I tried this cereal out when I saw it at Costco. I really like it for the fiber content and flavor. It tastes like Cheerios with cinnamon and sugar. It is definitely more dense and much more filling though and I am guessing that is the extra fiber. It has 35% of the daily recommended fiber. I was disappointed though when Costco stopped selling it. Very excited to find it here at Amazon and an even better price than Costco."
4,"When reviewing cat food, you really can't go with taste since cat food is disgusting, but my cats really seem to like it. When I open a can they run to the bowl. Not that they don't usually run to the bowl but they are very enthusiastic about this stuff.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that it's in little cans so there's not much. I have three cats. And it's a little too watery. The food and ""gravy"" quotient is heavy on the ""gravy"" side. Also it stinks a little. Most cat food stinks but I distinctly smelled this one. So it stinks more than usual.<br /><br />Beyond that, if you can afford it and you have finicky cats, give it a shot."
4,"The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.  Is it good coffee?  No, not really.  Is it good coffee for 60 cents a cup?  It sure can be.  These K-Cups taste good on both size settings of Keurig machines.<br /><br />I would like to point out though, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Donut Shop</a> brand of K-Cups are sold for the same price.  The Donut Shop coffee is a bit smoother in my opinion, and again, it's only 60 cents a cup.  Either way, the coffee you get won't be great, but it will be good for what you pay for."
4,"I purchased this product as a healthier alternative to the heavily-advertised energy drinks.  It does help with my mid-afternoon energy slump, but--and I guess this is a good thing--it is not a substitute for getting enough sleep and eating well!"
4,"Exactly what I was looking for in a recipe that I had been about ready to give up on & a recipe site said to go here & order it."
4,"I love the taste of this product.  Great texture and a good kick.  But, I am not crazy about the ingredients.  Wish there were some natural options."
4,"This can be used on any food or snack that needs a little extra zip. Great on tacos, tostados,and burritos too."
4,"A year ago, my dad received a Keurig for Christmas, and with it the K-Cup variety pack. I tried a couple coffee brands without milk and sugar, and this was the one that really caught my taste buds' attention. It's very mild, borderline light-bodied, with a subtle flavor and not too bitter. It doesn't taste like you're chewing on beans, but it's not watered down like some sub-standard brands you find in stores (I'm looking at you Folgers 10lbs jug of ""ground"").<br /><br />A few months later, a co-worker brought a Keurig to work and offered access to it. I purchased packs of Green Mountain Nantucket Blend the same day and enjoyed 48 cups of it, dreaming of the day I may have a Keurig at home. That has happened now, and I've got this on subscription.<br /><br />Strongly recommend if you are a fan of light-bodied coffee. One of the best K-Cups you'll find in that category."
4,"This is the canned food that my dog(miniature schnauzer) has eaten the longest.  I began mixing it with the Core dry food, and it did well for some months.  Gradually, she lost interest, and I had to try other flavors.  I still present it about once a week, and can get her to eat it with some persuasion.  It seems to be one of the better foods for her, but not as readily accepted."
4,"My dog likes it, and I've used this brand for years. Pretty good price. Yes, it has corn as a main ingredient, like many brands. I've tried ""organic"" dog food, and my dog wouldn't eat that stuff. This Purina Dog Chow, however, my dog chows down on (pun intended). Very happy to see this product on Subscribe & Save."
4,"I love green tea ice cream. Thats why i bought this product so i could add it into my ice cream maker and it was delicious! I also added it into sugar cookies making them green tea as well.<br /><br />I ordered this on a Sunday and it was in my possession on Tuesday. I've never had anything ship quite this fast!<br /><br />The only thing is that you get such a small amount for a medium price. You only need to use a small amount at a time though. I think i used two-three tsp at a time.<br /><br />I love the stuff, but want to see if they have it at an Asian market around the burgh for a cheaper price before ordering again. But if not, or if it becomes incontinent i will definitely order from this company without blinking an eyelash."
4,"One of the more widely marketed health aids in recent years has been alkalized water - Kangen and other companies have been selling devices to create alkaline water and sharing stories of amazing health benefits in those who consume this type of water. Those units can be very expensive, so if you wish to try this type of water for a while to see how it is for you without investing in a special system then Essentia's 9.5 pH water may be a good option. It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes, though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits. Since it comes in a plastic bottle you'll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn't make the water absorb plastic chemicals. If you are getting bottled water this is a pretty good option, though to be more eco-conscious you may wish to invest in your own water purification and pH control system to avoid the plastics."
5,"amazing...is the only word i can say to describe it!!!!! Now for those who aren't on a strict diet and arent used to not eating  chocolate foods as much wont find this as satisfying, but still will. however, for those who are have been missing that chocolate this is HEAVEN!!!! i JUST got it and kinda hard to just eat by itself bc it has a different after taste, but eating it with anything else u can't even tell!!!!!! i ate it with a sugar free vanilla pudding (this stuff is good too, only 60 calories, one gram of fat and no sugar) i mixed it with that and added some fiber one cereal to it and bam it was like my only little ice cream mix SOOO GOOD..also dipped a piece of light wheat bread (only 40 calories) into the chocolate dip and it was like a little chocolate donut/cake/eclair!! AMAZING!!! HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT IF U NEED THAT CHOCOLATE !!! :):)"
5,"If you love coconut, you will love these bars.  I feel like they taste like coconut macaroons without the chocolate.  I absolutely love them.  They have no artificial ingredients in them and they taste phenomenal!!!"
5,"Utterly delicious and often hard to find in grocery stores here in<br /><br />bucolic San Francisco."
5,"This is hands down the best cereal I have ever had. The taste is so unique from the other cornflake type cereals I've tried. I've been eating it for 20 years now and nothing comes close to it for taste. It also doesn't get soggy in your milk like so many other cereals do. I don't understand why I can't find it on shelves anymore. I love that I can get it here now. I will continue to. I would be lost without it."
5,"This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON."
5,"I found this on Amazon while I was looking for a snack other than chocolate.  I decided to order this without even trying it before.  When I received the order, I didn't know how it would taste.  To my surprise,  this was exactly what I was looking for...Nice, sweet taste. Definately a renewable item."
5,"This is really good cereal and is one of my favorites. It's very lightly sweet with wheat, corn and rice flavors. Very crunchy at first, then gets a little soggy, but still tastes great. It's also organic and not loaded with sugar. Since it's one of my favorites, 5 stars."
5,"These candies are a perfect combination of sour and sweet.  The three flavors: strawberry, pear, and apple, provide a nice variety."
5,"and it's much cheaper to buy in bulk through Amazon, than through their coffee club or website.  With a big enough order, shipping is free!"
5,"First, the actual product: Love this stuff. Tastier than bouillon cubes, easier to deal with, and the price is comparable given the large number of servings. We live in a vegan household and wouldn't ever be caught without it. Having said that, it's usually about half this price at the grocery store, not quite sure why Amazon's costs so much.<br /><br />Second, to the MSG haters: there is going to be no such thing as an MSG-free broth unless you make it yourself. Make sure you leave out all naturally-occuring sources of it as well. Furthermore, a cursory search for medical journal articles doesn't turn up any reputable sources concluding that MSG consumed in the quantities found in this kind of product possess any adverse health effects. If you'd like to share some citations, I'll be listening. In the meantime, I'm going to continue to use this product in every soup/gravy/ice cream topping I eat."
5,"I liked Chai Tea...that is until I tried Big Train Chai Tea.  It is  truely the best blend of spices with tea ever made! I've had Chai Tea at Starbucks, Borders, Jidders, Fry's Supermarket,...and other coffee houses, they were good, until I tried Big Train given to me by my sister.  The first time I tried it, it was like tasting ""heaven""!  It's really that GOOD!<br /><br />Trust me, try it, and you'll be glad you did.  The taste is superb.  Simply mix it with water, real easy.  I drink mine double the amount suggested on the bag, ah....truely yummy.<br /><br />I must admit I love it so much, I only drink it while on vacation and holiday's as I drink it too much and am weight conscious.  However it really make my vacations and holidays special.<br /><br />The best tasting of all the Big Train brand I have found is the Spiced Chai and the Spiced Decaf Chai.  The others taste a little odd to me.  Of the two mentioned, I prefer the decaf, it has a smoother taste and I can drink it at night, whereas the other will get me awake for hours.  That being said, when I need to clean my house or yard, the Spice Chai is perfect, gives me a real lift.<br /><br />Buy Big Train Chai, it is simply the Best Chai Tea you'll ever drink!!!"
5,"The flavor of this soup varies somewhat from from batch to batch, and I feel that overall, it is not as good as when it was first introduced. I still eat it several times a week though.  CAUTION!!  Do not get the ""Health Request"" variety thinking it has the same good taste... it is poor by comparison."
5,"I typically make my own dogfood but when I'm short on time, I cook the veggies & use this canned chicken. My dogs love it!"
5,"So I am not really a hard core athlete or anything. Just an average person trying to take better care of myself. I recently started walking 5 to 6 miles a day and reducing my caloric intake (about 1200 daily currently) as I am about 50 lbs over weight. I work with kids and have a very weird schedule, with that it sometimes difficult for me to get a good healthy meal in.<br /><br />So, I found these last week on Amazon and decided to try them. I got the creamy chocolate fudge and it's scrumptious! I threw mine in the freezer for about 10 minutes before I drank it, that's just a personal preference because I like milk products very cold. I have no complaints at all. It doesn't give you that funky after taste I've experienced with other drinks. I am happy I put this on my monthly subscribe list!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
5,"Junior size Bumble bars are just right to stave off  an energy drop.  Fewer calories and great flavors.<br />I carry these with me all the time."
5,"It's a pleasure to be able to mimic a crunchy peanut butter sandwich again,<br />without the annoying food allergies often associated with it.<br />I am intolerant to peanut butter and to wheat bread, due to migraine headaches.<br />I am able to enjoy SunButter Sunflower Seed Spread on gluten free bread.<br />I love the creamy consistency and the undeniable crunch from so many sunflower seeds. The texture is neither too dry, nor too oily; it is in fact perfect eaten as is; fresh out of the jar with a spoon!<br />I may be 50, but the little kid in me adores the fresh, excellent taste."
5,"I had been drinking Crystal light on & off the past few years but now I am drinking almost all the time.  I now have my Mother-in-Law drinking it also.  The Raspberry Ice Tea is really the greatest!!  It is the only one I really like."
5,"With a delicious strawberry flavor, these fruit twists have a great texture, easy to chew  and they are organic!  I liked them a lot better than the fruit strip type products, which tend to be sticky and a bit tough to bite or chew."
5,"My 7 pound poodle was always resistant to eating until we tried the sunrise products from Cesar.  Now he eats breakfast every day!  For additional goodness, remove lid and mircowave for 15 seconds....your dog will go crazy for it!<br />I have now purchased this to be delivered every two months--subscribe and save is a great deal for this item!"
5,"Polar Kipper Snacks are sweet, smokey and firm fillets. They are less expensive than some other brands I used to buy, and of much higher quality.  In addition, ordering them through Amazon was fast, simple and a pleasure.  This was not my first order of this wonderful product, and it will not be the last.  Try them."
5,"These are very good bars and being individually wrapped stay fresh a long time. My husband carries them in his car for a quick and easy snack."
5,"If you like the original, you may be pleasantly surprised by this product.  It has a sweet rich flavor with the familiar bite.  Pepper Plant has a winner with this one.  It is great on chicken as a baste for bbq or as a dipping sauce."
5,"I love those Kind Bars my favorite by far are the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio & the Cranberry Almond.  I'm not that crazy about the Fruit & Nut just didn't turn me on like the other 2 flavors.  KIND Plus Nutrition Bars, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants 12 ea"
5,"This is a treat that makes you feel as if you flew to France and spent a fortune on fine chocolate.  Wonderful, smooth, a chocolate dream!"
5,"This offer is impossible to pass up. Dollar for dollar it is the one to act on.  As for Season's sardines; not all sardine brands are created equal.  Overall, the Season brand brislings are better in just about every respect.  They have a higher consistency of quality and taste good.  If you are new to sardines it can be daunting to find the right ones.  Generally, you will only want to focus on the ""Brislings"" because of their smaller size and subsequent better taste.<br /><br />Verdict: eat this<br /><br />PS.  Alton Brown does a splendid job of explaining the sardine and gives some ideas on preparation in this vid...<br />[...]"
5,"It is very strong and pure! you just need a little bit to get a great flavor. Helps with digestion but the smell is strong!!"
5,"After going back and forth between pet stores exchanging bags of treats over and over again, i finally found that my 14 week old shih tzu Bailey loves these. He also loves the Wellness Just for Puppy canned food as well - gobbles it up. He is one of those pups that is super particular about his food. With other brands of food, he wont eat just dry - it must be mixed with wet AND must be heated to a certain temperature. With Wellness, he gobbles it all up mixed with his dry food, no matter what the temp.<br /><br />All the other brands of treats that i have tried with Bailey, he would sniff then then turn his nose up at them and walk away. I was getting frustrated that i could not find any treats that my spoiled little pups would like! After seeing how much he liked the Wellness puppy wet food, i thought that i should give these a try. He LOVES them. now we can really make progress on training Bailey. Its impossible to teach a pup anything without treats he likes!<br /><br />Im so happy with this brand and i cant wait til we finish his old dry food so i can switch him to the wellness dry food as well!"
5,"These seeds are a good side and consistency.  They have an authentic BBQ flavor with an underlying sweetness from the whiskey.  Like almost all flavored seeds you can't eat more than a serving at a time without your mouth feeling a bit raw, but that is part of the seed experience. Dig in!"
5,"I LOVE THIS BRAND OF FOOD FOR MY 2 SHELTIES.IT'S THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED FOR THEM AND THEY LOVE IT.I HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT BRANDS ON THEM SINCE THEY ARE PICKY EATERS AND THEY LOVED THIS RIGHT FROM THE START.I HAVE TO DRIVE TO ANOTHER TOWN TO BUY FROM THE PETCO THERE BUT IT'S WORTH IT!"
5,"I have tried many different brands and types of chai, and this is definitely my all-time favorite.  Lovely with a splash of milk, or try the recipe on the box of brewing in a saucepan with milk and sugar for added flavor and creaminess."
5,"I am a diabetic and of course I have to watch my sugar intake. Before becoming diabetic, I enjoyed my morning drink of orange juice. I have found that Crystal Light Orange drink is an acceptable replacement drink at breakfast. Thank you for the product."
5,"I don't know why grocery stores in our area have stopped stocking this item.  We make an excellent chicken & broccoli recipe with this sauce.  We mix the spicy Szechuan with the milder Classic sauce to our taste.  We can still find the Classic in stores.  We have used this product for years and are very satisfied and happy to find a place to buy it."
5,"When you want a cup of something warm and tasty, this is it. Sometime I want something warm, but don't want a sweet drink like tea, coffee or cocoa this stuff hits the spot.  It's only 60 calories per cup of soup. this is also filling and better than some other food choices you can make.<br /><br />I like the fact that it's rich and creamy tasting. it's salty but not overly so.  I used to always drink this as a kid - and by far this flavor is my favorite.  Amazon is the only place that sells it for this GREAT price."
5,"I buy these often, I'm always satisfied. My dog loves them, and they keep her teeth clean, and breath not so stinky."
5,"My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it's $10 cheaper and free shipping!"
5,"Even though it's all natural the taste is rich with fresh fruit flavor.  In this way it's even better than standard dried fruit."
5,"This food is a vast improvement over the store bought crap. My dog's coat got softer within days, his breath stopped stinking immediately and he smells a lot better. He is more active and seems healthier and happier. No more rendering plant floor sweepings for my dog! $20 a month is a small sacrifice to make for my dog's health and well being. I honestly don't know why everyone isn't more concerned about what kind of inedible junk they put in regular store bought dog food."
5,"I love my Twinnings Earl Grey tea and purchasing through Amazon.com is easier and cheaper than going to the supermarket."
5,"Good for him and makes him come in at night, what's not to like? Not enough words meow meow meow"
5,"Upon receiving these, I was very surprised regarding such good packaging of the product, but upon eating it was amazed. This vegetarian product is one of the nicest I have had the pleasure to enjoy for quite a while. I cannot compare this to the real thing, since I have never tried the real thing, but if this is not acceptable to vegetarians, vegans and non vegetarians, I would be most surprised."
5,"...that we didn't know about this product about 2 years ago.  It took both of us, one to hold and pry open our sweet cat's mouth and another to deposit pill(s) and squirt in the water, twice a day.  We had both gotten bitten before, but the most recent bite on my left thumb was pretty serious and got infected. Fun! Anyway, a client told us about Pill Pockets and price be d**ned, I'd pay 4 times as much just to not get bitten again.  These things are heaven sent. Thanks, Pill Pockets! :)"
5,"This product is great you would not know it was sugar free wish they made more products like this hope they keep making this."
5,"I have been having this product for lunch 5 times per week over the last six months and it it has contributed to my loosing 50 pds."
5,"I have the lazy couch potato dog that the first reviewer described.  An overweight black lab adult female who is quite lazy.  Switching foods from Purina to TOTW Bison, and not measuring daily feedings, and feeding her as she pleases, she has more energy, is more playful, and has already lost 10lbs. and is five pounds away from her ideal weight of 75lbs.  I highly recommend this food to all dog owners."
5,"I love, love, LOVE this brand of protein bars...great taste, not to sweet and a lot of nuts in the bars. I really like this particular flavor."
5,"I purchased this curry paste to make Butter Chicken. There are no Indian food markets in the rural area in which I live, and I was delighted at the quality and quantity which I received. I will definitely purchase from this seller again. Thanks!  Melanie"
5,"this is the best, most flavorful maple syrup I have ever tasted!  The price beats any atthe grocery store. the only diwn side is the plastic bottle. I lrefer not buying any plastic if I can help it. I will pribably buy the more costly organic brands at the store because they are in glass.  what a shame.<br /><br />It was shipped almost next day, is organic and I hope they start using jars or glass bottles soon"
5,"My daughter loves the A1 Steak Sauce flavor of this particular Jack Link's beef jerky.  With Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, I can make sure that she receives a care package of her favorite beef jerky at school every month.  I get a reminder that it will ship, the shipping is free and I get a discount to boot!  I can't beat it, especially since this flavor can be difficult to find in stores."
5,"These cookies are great! Of almost all of the favors, they are the only ones my husband, brother and his wife like...even over the chocolate! The spirulina  ones taste mostly like banana, so they are good too, but my tasting audience thiught they looked weird.<br />I like the crispness of the carrot ones (spirulina often softer/chewer) and while there is no overwhelming carrot taste, there is no overwhelming any taste which is actually nice as all the favors simply mesh well together to create a tasty, crunchy ""cookie""."
5,"My husband loves this creamer and can't find it in the stores so we ordered a few cases from Amazon.  When they arrived we saw that they were not packed in shrinkwrap, but were left in the box individually on their own..therefore a few broke open and we had a very sticky sloppy mess!  We were not pleased at all...yuckky to clean up.  We still love the product, but heartly suggest they are wrapped tightly inside the box to eliminate this mess!"
5,"My 9 1/2 year old pug seems to have developed a senesitive stomach as he got older and lost some teeth.. So I had to put him on some soft food that would not upset his tummy.. I bought these for him and Thought he was gonna eat right thru the bowl the 1st time I put it out for him.. Needless to say he absoutly loves his food! and it seems to agree with his tummy."
5,"This was a great price even with the shipping charge added on.  Prefect for diabetics and weight watchers."
5,"I was introduced to these treats when I took my dogs to the vet, and saw her giving them these treats.<br />The dogs went crazy for them!<br />Not only that, but there is nothing in this but pure liver.  No added salt, etc....<br /><br />Healthy treats that my dogs love.  And the price is right, too!"
5,"I have tried a couple of flavors and the cheddar is by far my favorite.  The Sour Cream/Onion has an off-putting sweet yet salty powder.  These are a little high in sodium and they are not like regular chips, but they are a delicious chip-like snack.  I recommend the individual serving packs because it is very easy to eat more than one serving of the larger bags."
5,"Love Zico coconut water!  I order 2 cases a month and have been extremely please with both the quality of this product and the service.  No complaints here!"
5,"Definitely the best! You don't really need the butter in the recipe (I put tons of butter on top).  We have been using it since we stayed at LaQuinta in CO (2010).  We have the Oster belgian waffle maker (flip), and they are amazing waffles. We ate waffles every weekend for a long time they were so good!  Can't go wrong here."
5,"I had a sample size pack of three Eagle Pack varieties. (Lamb, fish, and duck.) Last night, my super-picky Aussie mix suddenly decided this fish variety was as good as some of her higher end training treats. I'm not sure how long the novelty will last, but I'm always excited when I find a kibble that works as a treat at class."
5,"Timothy's Decaf K cups has a very consistant and great taste.  Many friends drink it without realizing it is decaf. Medium roast and delicious flavor."
5,"My older cat recently spent time in the animal hospital due to a blocked bladder. When he came home and the vet gave me pills to give him, she warned me that the pills stink and they had a hard time getting him to take them. I spent the first three days crushing them up and mixing them with tuna, then had to sit there and make sure he ate it - and that my other cat didn't!<br /><br />I found the Pill Pockets review when I googled ""how to get a cat to take a pill."" The idea was amazing, and the first few reviews were promising. I went to PetsMart and bought it the same day, and wow! My kitty ate that treat-covered pill like he was starving, and after he was done sat there and meowed at me for another. He even crunched right into the pill and never thought twice about finishing it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to every cat owner - salmon or chicken, doesn't matter, but these things work!!"
5,"Since my husband brought this coffee back from Costa Rica we haven't bought any other kind.  It is truly delicious, smooth and no bitterness whatsoever.  You will not be disappointed and you will be hooked as well.<br />JTH from GA."
5,"This tastes great and is unusual. I'm a big fan of marzipan. This gets an A+."
5,"My little Rat Terrier is 5 years old and "" our baby "".... She has no earthly idea she is a dog...... She gives this senior couple much joy and companionship.<br />After 5 years and many, many bags of treats we only spend our money on this TREAT !!!...It is the only one she will eat !!!!<br />Smells good and looks good... BUT KEEP IT IN REFRIGERATOR OR YOU WILL LOSE IT !!!!! WE FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY !!!!!<br /><br />5 STARS FROM US AND PUDDIN !!!!"
5,"My now 4 month old baby Doxie, Fenway Franks, absolutley LOVEEESS his chicken soup. I'm still trying it work out the balance of wet and dry cuz my poor baby alternates between diaherra and constipation. (Before anyone gets on my case, vet says its normal for his age) but i have a boy with a very high food drive and he just LOVES this stuff. He cleans the bowl for me. I still have him on his kibble Welness but I bought the dry of this food and will soon switch him over"
5,"I love this formula! It's great for babies and not full of tons of chemicals and waste.  I started my daughters on this formula to supplement because I couldn't keep up with her appetite. Other formulas taste HORRIBLE, and had a bad metallic taste. This formula tastes much better and smells better too. My child didn't have any problems with constipation but her BM's where much more pasty compared to the watery breast milk ones. If you do feed this is an infant make sure you give them a **VITIAMIN D SUPPLEMENT**. This formula does not contain enough vitamin d, but and neither does breast milk (so no biggie). But it has just enough and (in most cases) more vitamins than other formulas! It's nice to know you're not giving your baby crap. I would recommend this, BUT do not go with Earth's Best, it contains hexane which is dangerous for babies. My only complaint would be that it is foamy, but if you let it sit for a few minutes then it goes away. :)"
5,"Hempseeds is one of my favorite foods.<br />it has a lot protein and fiber. I like and trust this product and label. Since I am vegetarian, I use hempseeds daily. My use of this food is too numerous to mention it all. You could try it on your salad , baking bread or pastries, as snack in a bowl of nuts, raisins,dried cranberries or whatever else that you might like. This food is so delicious that you could use it by itself and be happy with your choice. I recommend for people who do not know this food to give it a try. I do not think you could do wrong.<br />those who know this item, happy eating."
5,"This stuff is absolutely incredible.  I'm allergic to just about everything, including the dust that rises off of traditional clay and silica litter.  If you have a special room for your litter, you'll notice that regular dust gets on every surface.  It's disturbing, really.  That stuff is going into your lungs you know.  Feline Pine has NO DUST.  Pour it out, and your litter area smells pleasantly of a lumber yard (well, I find that pleasant).  When cats use the box, urine breaks down the pellets and is absorbed.  Solid waste sits on top.  You only run into trouble if your cat has gastrointestinal track problems - loose bowel movements are more difficult to scoop.  The pellets track a bit, but they're large and a litter mat will slow their progress across a room.<br /><br />Now, I will offer one caveat: this litter is terrific, but only if you use the right box.  If you use a regular, non-sifting box, the pellets will break down into sawdust, and the sawdust will then just sit there.  This sawdust can track further than the pellets, because it can stick to kitty feet.  The solution?  A sifting litter box.  Either the Tidy Cat Breeze box or the Feline Pine litter box works, the latter better than the former.  I have both.  The Tidy Cat Breeze litter pads also work nicely with this product in the holding reservoir of a sifting-type box.  Put the Feline Pine on top, shake the box or move the sawdust around with a scoop, and sawdust will fall into the reservoir under the top tray.  Et voila!  No sawdust on top, fresh pellets are not wasted with constant litter changes.  Just make sure to shake the broken pellets into the bottom and there's no tracking.  Scoop feces and flush down the toilet (yes, this litter is flushable too!).  If you use the Tidy Cat Breeze pads, they will help soak up any moisture in the sawdust that falls into the reservoir, eliminating any odors.<br /><br />Also a bonus: you only need about an inch of litter in the box.  A bag will stretch for quite awhile.  As pellets turn to sawdust and fall into the reservoir, just add more pellets.  No litter changes necessary.  Just remember to empty out the litter box reservoir as it fills up.<br /><br />In terms of getting cats to use it, just mix the Feline Pine with your regular stuff for about a week, gradually increasing the Feline Pine and decreasing the regular stuff.  I trained a 9-year-old cat to use the litter in a week.<br /><br />In short, this is a miracle product, especially in a multi-cat household."
5,"I'd had these many years ago, and hadn't seen them. I was SO glad to find them again.  They are just baked cheese- nothing else. The flavor is intensely cheesy, and a bit on the salty side- but something I'll buy again.  Outstanding for those with carbohydrate restrictions (hey, diabetics- I'm one of you, and finding these to be just right for that salty snack urge). I also like the portion control.  :)  BUY THEM !!!"
5,"I rarely write reviews but for this product it is well worth it. This stuff is amazing I eat it everyday on my morning toast. And put it in my hair and skin. Makes you glow and does not make you look oily. LOVE IT!"
5,"These crackers are a healthy alternative, to most other fast snacks.  They taste fantastic and go well with soup or salad.  They also taste great when topped with Turkey, Chicken, or whatever else you choose.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOQHAI"">Ry-Krisp Seasoned, 8.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>"
5,"I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.I love them,but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them."
5,"This makes my mornings complete without having to drop a lot of dough at a coffee shop. It's the only way to go."
5,"If you like a cup of bold coffee, then this is the one for you.  I read the reviews and was a bit skeptical but I was surprised.  Anyone who likes Starbucks would enjoy getting this.  A great kick in the morning without the bitter taste.  Enjoy!"
5,"It really does make ""mushroom"" popcorn. It's  more expensive than regular popcorn but It's well-worth a try, whether you are an aficionado or not. I tried it with the Barleans organic coconut oil and it was delicious! It comes with instruction too, which is nice."
5,"We got these [...] for $7 a box which was a great price!  My daughter is 1.5 yrs old and she LOVES them.  When we ask her what she wants for a snack she says ""Ap-ple""  It is great, she gets a full serving of fruit and there is nothing in them that is bad for her. I think that the prices here seem high, however when you take into account that each bag has one whole apple, you would pay that amount for fresh produce and end up throwing out some of it anyways.  My daughter easily finishes an entire bag and what she doesn't we can save for the next day.  WE LOVE these apples!"
5,"The Rapunzel no salt added vegetable bouillon is very tasty, both as a stand alone broth and as a fabulous alternative to cooking with oil. Instead of sauteeing our vegetables in oil we now add a bouillon cube to water (with garlic and other spices to taste) to sautee mushrooms, spinach and all other manner of vegetables. Dishes are less greasy and oily, and this bouillon subtlely enhances the natural flavors of food with minimal added sodium. An excellent, versatile, low-caloric healthy product. Highly recommended!"
5,"These cookies didn't last very long in our household.  My young children enjoyed them very much including their friends.  It was convenient to have them in bags to take along on car rides, picnics, and for snack after swimming."
5,"I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews this has been given. I thought it was very good! It does have a bit of a different taste, slightly like molasses, I thought; but the peanut flavor is there. I didn't find it to be runny at all. Maybe the earlier reviewer hadn't refrigerated it. (It must be refrigerated after opening as there are no added preservatives.) I have stayed away from PB for years because of the fat content and calories- now I can have it again! (And, no, I don't work for the company, either!) I find it to be very satisfying even without the extra calories and fat. So I would urge others to judge for themselves. If you need to limit your calorie and fat intake you just might want to give this a shot. I'm sure glad I did!"
5,"If you drink a lot of Gatorade, mixing your own with the powder is MUCH cheaper than buying the bottles. Your water quality will affect the taste, but we have good tapwater where we live, so this isn't a problem."
5,"This looks like it is meant for a store counter, not a gift or home purchase.  The tins would make nice favors, hostess gifts, stocking stuffers, etc.<br />They don't mention it, but the bags are pods.  Not that you can't use them as a bag, but still a surprise.  I also didn't expect the tins to be as large as they are, I was thinking pocket size. The tin is about 3.5"" square by 1.5"".  The eight bags are sealed in a foil package so you know it is fresh when you open it.  The tin has a tight fit so they won't go stale right away after you open the package.<br /><br />I am not a big tea drinker.  I love the tea I get in Chinese restaurants, but I have never been able to duplicate the taste.  I know it is good for me so I have experimented a lot this year.<br />So far I have only drank the pomegranate.  It smells divine. I used one pod to make a small teapot of tea and it steeped quickly, has a rich color and a sweet and delicate aroma.  I detect no bitterness to the tea itself.  Success!<br />I am pleased with the Bentley brand and have given it as a gift to great acclaim.<br />I recommend it."
5,"My grandson is a beef jerky addict. We don't have much to choose from here so I ordered this. He absolutely loves it!!! He says it's not hard and has such a good taste. It's not too hot which would okay with him if it was.  He'd like more but he eats it so fast that it's going to be a sometime treat for him. The first day he ate 3 bags."
5,"Being British in America and finding a good ""cuppa"" is almost impossible. but I think with the stash breakfast tea I can happily live here forever."
5,"This has got to be the most unappetizing picture of any ""food product"" I've ever seen on the 'net. For those die-hard veggies who think that this is cruelty at its worst, look at the bright side. This graphic image of a fluffy happy bunny being stripped of its fur, its head and its bowels, could be enough to push me to the veggie side of life and then forever abandon my occasional meat-eating tendencies.<br /><br />What will Amazon sell next? Uranium in a jar? Oh, never mind. They're already selling a handy one-use size jar of Uranium Ore 238 on this site for people who might choose to cook their bunnies in a conveniently sized mini-nuclear reactor. Hey, it's a swell idea for those fun folks who live off the grid in those isolated cabins high up in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. You can have your well-cooked bunny and have it glow in the dark, too.<br /><br />God bless the internet."
5,"My dog loves them, and we received them very quickly!  I highly recommend this product, especially to owners with dogs who love to chew."
5,"This candy bar is about the best there is!  The chocolate is very nice and the rum is proportioned just right. It's strong enough to taste but not overbearing.  I was so happy to find it available at Amazon so I can order it more often.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good flavor of rum every now and then."
5,"I really like this product as a sweetner on almost everything I use a sweetner for.  Will definitely purchase again."
5,"I have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year, and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also. When I look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food, it is downright nauseating! I bought some of this Newman's Own and my dog loves it. She usually gobbles it up the minute I put it into the bowl."
5,"I came across this soda entirely by accident when I went out with some friends to a Peruvian restaurant. They didn't have much to offer for beverages and even though I normally don't drink soda I decided to give this Peruvian favorite a try. I liked it! It reminded me of cream soda with a hint of lime and very carbonated. I can't beleive that I ordered a six pack off of Amazon but I wanted to introduce it to some family members. Instead, when it arrived I stashed it away and lovingly and selfishly enjoyed each can until it was gone!"
5,"I have used Sportea for years.  It is the best--refreshing, with no calories, and great for energy without the lows."
5,"The El Sabroso Guacachips are the best tasting guacamole tortilla chips on earth!  They have a very smooth, NOT spicy, NOT hot taste and I can eat them until I am STUFFED!  These are absolutely delicious and a ""must-have"" for a true chip lover!  If I could, I would buy 10 cases of them!  I LOVE these El Sabroso Guacamole chips and everyone else will too!"
5,"These bars are great!  Very soft.  I feed them to my toddler and I have to give him small pieces in his mouth, otherwise there would be seeds stuck all over.  Nutty with a slight honey taste."
5,"I love the cheesy buckwheat casserole made with the recipe on the back of the box. We're served it to numerous people and everyone loves it! It's a great vegetarian entree, too!"
5,"This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5"") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try."
5,"Great price, and they are fresh too.  I've ordered some other products in bulk, and they were stale.  So, I was thrilled when I re-ordered this prodcut and it was fresh.  I usually order the chicken ones, but I went off of someone's review and ordered the duck ones.  My dog likes the duck better.  Great price and I'm happy that they are very fresh and flexible.  So, they are good for a dog who has only a few teeth or has problem chewing.  You can also break them into smaller pieces.<br />Thanks."
5,"I have a Delonghi BAR32 espresso machine (about $90) and these pods produce fantastic espresso every time.  I put a pod in, make sure the little paper tab is folder over so the whole pod is in the pod adapter, tamp it down a little (I just use the built-in tamper on the Delonghi) and that's it...  20 seconds later I have a great cup of espresso with lots of crema.  I tried the Illy (black), but for 3x the price I actually think they make much worse espresso.  These Lavazza pods are cheap and work great.<br /><br />The only thing they could improve would be to make the pod wrappers recyclable."
5,"Most mint teas tend to be herbals- peppermint, spearmint, and the like.  What I like so much about this tea is that it combines mint with black tea.  I'm very much a black tea drinker.  I love a variety of flavored and unflavored black teas, so for me, having a black tea mint option is a great thing.  On to the tea itself- I find this tea to be extremely smooth, with a nice mint kick.  The mint flavor is certainly strong, but it's not overwhelming.  This works well as an after-dinner tea, if you don't mind the caffeine.  The mint is refreshing, but I find it helps me relax more than wake up.  The tea offers a very clean taste.  Absolutely recommended for those who like mint and flavored black teas."
5,"Teens love em, adults love em...somehow the little 5 year old doesn't like them though.  He's just a strange little one though.  These are really good!  Bag is light, which you'd expect for 100 calories, but it's still more than we expected for a 100 cal snack.  Seems like a good price too, compared with other snacks I've seen in the grocery store (haven't seen these  yet).<br /><br />EDIT: haha! the 5 year old caved, he likes them now too!"
5,"The products were a nice blend of different teas, all at a good price. I would recommend this package if you are not sure of what teas to settle in on."
5,"This is the best tea I have ever had. It has a unique fruity flavor that is both tart and a tiny bit sweet at the same time. This is also a really good deal considering that if you buy 80 tea bags from the company's website it would cost 13.95 (not including shipping and handling which costs ~$8) and buying from amazon you get 108 tea bags with cheaper shipping."
5,"This is a wonderful product.  Most manufacturers do not consider many people are unable to eat almonds and this is an unusual and delicious combination -- thank you so much for this new combination....only down side -- difficult to find in many stores.<br /><br />Thank you"
5,"I love the Peanut Butter Candy Cakes so much. They remind me of my childhood lunches in grade school. They are delicious!! They ship well, give them a try if you have not already indulged in the best Tastykake item ever.Well, that and the Butterscotch Krimpets. Mmmm...."
5,"I started noticing a difference after 48 hours in my 13 year old daschaund after starting use...it has been 4 days and I am glad I got this from vine and am sure I will buy more for my old boy"
5,"First saw this item at my sons house and knew I had to have one.  I didn't need another thing on my counter and loved the quality.  The holder was out of stock at the time.  When I contacted CoffeeKeepers they advised that the item would be back in stock within a week and then notified me again when it became available.  Their customer service exceeded my expectations and the holder is great.  Can't wait to show everyone."
5,"Since starting Wellness wet food, not only does my cat love it, but certain problems she has had cleared up - throwing up, and chronic watery eyes have disappeared. One thing - she gets finicky about eating it when it's cold. At room temp she devours it!"
5,"Since I am not a diabetic, I cannot comment on the reviews by others who found that this pasta affected their insulin levels.  I can, however, report what I have learned.<br /><br />I discussed the pros and cons of Dreamfields pasta products with my gastroenterologist.  To begin with, he tells me that this is the only pasta he eats at home.  It leaves him without the gassy, bloated feeling associated with other pastas.  (I also find this to be true.)  When I questioned him about a reviewer's findings that, acids (tomato sauce) change the ability of this pasta to remain a low-carb food (and thus, rendering its claim to be invalid), he told me that this makes no sense.  Tomato-based products are low acid.  Our bodies' own digestive acids are extremely strong.  If they weren't, we would be unable to properly digest our food.  As the pasta passes through the stomach and intestines, the carbohydrate level does not increase.<br /><br />For those who are gluten intolerant (Celiac disease), this is not a gluten-free product.  But, for those of us who mildly react to gluten, you may be pleasantly surprised at how well your body tolerates Dreamfields pasta.<br /><br />Eating this pasta product in normal quantities (2 ounces dried), as with any pasta product, is important.  If we follow the example of Italians, pasta is only a small portion of the meal.  To eat a large portion of pasta without also consuming a helping of vegetables, a salad, and a protein, is not healthy.<br /><br />As for texture and taste, Dreamfields pasta is excellent.  It looks, feels, and tastes like any regular brand of pasta.  You can use it as you would with any of your pasta recipes.  With the A+ rating it gets from my doctor, this will be our brand of pasta from now on."
5,"These Porcini Mushrooms are beautiful. They are whole sliced mushrooms. If you want Porcini Mushrooms save your time looking, just buy these... You will not regret your decision. Happy cooking!!!!"
5,"Great cofee, great price, especially when you use Amazon subscription service.  Can't go wrong with Gloria Jean's if you like mild."
5,"This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it."
5,"Most dogs LOVE Greenies, and they are supposed to be great for their teeth, but they are also quite expensive. I found this 96 count package on Amazon for under 25.00!!!! Note that this is the petite size as I have little dogs, so if you are looking for the larger Greenies you need to check the pricing. The product arrived within a couple of days, and is a great value. Normally a package of 6 or so petite Greenies cost aprox 7.00!"
5,"This is one of the ingredients I insist to add to almost every spicy Indian dish that we cook. It adds a special taste to any food. The packing was good, no leak.."
5,"I had a sample size pack of three Eagle Pack varieties. (Lamb, fish, and duck.) Last night, my super-picky Aussie mix suddenly decided this fish variety was as good as some of her higher end training treats. I'm not sure how long the novelty will last, but I'm always excited when I find a kibble that works as a treat at class."
5,"I liked the flavor and texture of the tortillas.  They are not spicy, but the taste is not bland because of the olives. The chips are small and the serving size in the bag is just enough for a quick, satisfying snack."
5,"I really like the organic Zero product.Other products similar have an aftertaste or do not agree with me but this product is very good.I ahve recommended it to friends and they like it as well.I would recommend it to others."
5,"I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE"">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market."
5,"I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea...One time I bought Senna tea out of the blue, just for the heck of it...and decided to drink it one night and the next day I was exploding downstairs.<br /><br />So I decided not to do the same with this one. This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal."
5,"This was my first time to try anything with carnivorous plants. I looked around at a few websites about how to care for them, I am by no means an expert. Its been a month since I received my plant and it is thriving. Just follow the simple instructions and you will have a great plant. A word of warning though, don't expect a plant that looks like the pictures, that's just an example of what it will grow to look like. Also something I learned is that Venus Fly Traps will actually go dormant and look pretty much dead, but with some watering and sunlight they will come back just as healthy. After having the plant a little more than a month I'm already about to re-pot it into a larger pot. Great product, quick shipping from Hirt's. I just ordered a pitcher plant and sundew from them since I was so satisfied with my Fly Trap. I'd recommend this plant to anyone who likes unique things. I'm actually working on a CP garden to try and rid my backyard and deck of annoying bugs without spray or chemicals.<br /><br />Overall, Great buy at a great price."
5,"I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!"
5,"Rice bran is a healthy way for those on a gluten free diet to get fiber."
5,"Everyone loves Life cereal!!  This is a great price, better than any of the sales I have ever seen!! Please note, this is the smaller size box!! Even still, great value."
5,"I love this soup. I only tried it recently and went back to my local store to buy more. I have found locally that different stores carry different varieties of the Campbell's Soup At Hand and the Creamy Chicken is not carried at all my local stores, so I was very glad to find it at Amazon. Although it does not contain much actual chicken, this soup has a wonderful chicken flavor. It is so creamy and good and tastes like real comfort food. It is great for a quick lunch or dinner, either alone or combined with a salad or sandwich. I almost wish Campbell's made it available in larger cans, but that's true of all the Soup At Hand flavors.<br /><br />I hope that Amazon will continue to carry these soups, as the price is much better per container (about $1.30 each) than the individual prices at some of the larger grocers."
5,"Granted, Matt is now 21 pounds and needs to lose weight (maybe 4 or 5 pounds according to the vet) because he will eat just about anything, but he really likes this cat food.  We have to measure his food and can never leave any out for him because he will eat all day if left to his own devices.  No, he does not get any people food.  He did love Natural Balance from the start, and we have never bought this particular brand before.  Matt is 12 years old, so he is considered a senior, just like me.  I do not like doing this, but because he is so particular about his litter box, I have to scoop it every day (otherwise, the consequences are not pretty).  So, before starting him on Natural Balance, I noticed that his stools had become pretty loose over the last couple of months.  That immediately changed with the Natural Balance; everything is more solid, plus he is a little more regular than he was, although older cats do not always go number 2 every day.  Anyway, he is happy, and so am I.  I will revisit this review once time has elapsed in order to report on whether this product has helped Matt to lose weight."
5,"I have three very picky cats who quickly get bored with the same old food. As a result, I am constantly on the lookout for different varieties of cat food that they will eat. Forget about any of the veterinarian supplied cat foods. My cats' response to those cat foods is consistently, ""you must be kidding!"". The weruva chicken cat food was very well received and gobbled down. But please remember, in the world of cats, variety is the answer! I rotate the foods I feed my cats each day. Just like people, cats do not like eating the same thing day in and day out, and don't hesitate to let you know their dissatisfaction."
5,"I think this is just as good or better than lindt or any of those fancy names in chocolate. These guys have deleciouse and VERY UNIQUE flavore combos. I love this one with the real ginger bits , if you dont like ginger of course I would try another dark choclate one!! SO good.I like the other reviwers comment. It is that good."
5,"I love this stuff! When I ordered I didn't read the description, so when it arrived I was pretty surprised to see a jar of powder! After reading the instructions I mixed some up and tried it out... AMAZING. so good. As other reviews have said, mix it with jelly! It taste just like a regular ole peanut butter & jelly sandwich, for under 200 calories. Try the chocolate one too! Mix it with marshmallow fluff!"
5,"Items are just what we requested. They stopped selling these dog treats at Cosco and Sams. Glad they were available on-line"
5,"THIS WAS MY SECOND ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT.  SOMETIMES ONE BAG CAN BE A LITTLE SALTY, BUT IN GENERAL, WE REALLY LIKE THEM.  I PUT THEM IN OUR MICROWAVE FOR 2 MINUTES AND PRESTO, YOU HAVE WARM PORK RINDS.  BE AWARE, THEY DO NOT MAKING A POPPING SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU MAKE MICROWAVE POPCORN, SO DON'T WORRY.  JUST MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION AND SHAKE THE BAG WELL TO MOVE THEM AROUND.  YOU CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THEM IN THE STORE, SO IT'S GREAT THAT AMAZON CARRIES THEM ON THEIR SITE.  FOR LESS THAN A DOLLAR A BAG, YOU HAVE WARM FRESH PORK RINDS."
5,"Prima Taste Rendang Curry is mighty tasty. I'm no expert on Singaporean food, but I have traveled and lived in Asia so like various types of curry. The box contains powdered coconut milk and the curry paste in separate bags. Additionally, the recipe calls for 28 oz. of beef, 2.5 t. vegetable oil, and 4/5 c water. Serve with rice or mashed potatoes. The package says there is no added MSG, artificial coloring, or added preservatives. The package also says it contains the following common allergens: soybeans, wheat, tree nuts, and milk products. It is a product of Singapore. I didn't have enough beef thawed so I also used some chicken. It is easy to prepare.<br /><br />Both my husband and I liked it.  I don't mind the bits of leaf in it. Sadly, it is quite high in fat and contains a bit of sugar. Serving size is only 2 tablespoons of the mix and that has 9 grams of fat and 5 grams of carbs. I realistic serving is probably 3 times that plus the meat and rice or whatever you serve it with. I may buy this as a treat, but I can't have it all the time. Maybe, it would be ok if I broke it down to very small servings...which is what I did with the leftovers."
5,"My mother loves oatmeal raisin cookies but she is hard to please.  I like healthy foods,,,we found the perfect combination of both with these,,,,they are super for people with food allergies, no eggs, no corn, no refined sugar,,,,but are absolutely moist and scrumptious,,,it's rare that my mother and I can find something like this that we both agree on,,,but these hit the mark,,,,,,,,try them, you won't be disappointed!"
5,"I love this product. I am already almost out of it and need to order more. Shipping was fast. Thank you"
5,"I got my cat at a shelter and they feed this to the cats there. My cat Wanda loves it. Never any waste and it makes for a cleaner litter box. Cuts stool odor down 90%. No dyes that can stain either. Keeps Wanda happy and very healthy."
5,"These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips.<br /><br />These chips are technically ""multigrain"" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these chips!"
5,"My son is supplemented with formula, and sometimes when we're out in town it collides with a feeding. Nothing has proven to be more useful and convenient than these bottles. They are premixed and measured, all that is needed is a nipple and it's ready for feeding! A lot of reviewers apparently don't realize that Amazon's prices fluxuate and you don't rate a product on the price. While at one point they might have had this insanely overpriced, currently it is 7.97 - cheaper than Babies R Us - and ships for free with Super Saver or Prime. Hands down, a better deal than a brick and mortar store. But, setting price aside as it could possibly change again, the product itself is fantastic, and I will continue to buy it."
5,"Great imaginative movie. Tim Burton is a genius!<br />Acting is great-funny, creepy, realistic given the unrealistic underpinning of the movie!"
5,"My son recently began eating gluten-free, and he enjoys this cereal. I am happy about the contents. I like him to start the day off with whole grains. Also, I enjoy the cereal. It tastes and smells a lot like vanilla wafers, which are a favorite of many childhoods. This will become a regular purchase for our household."
5,"I feed my two Pugs and occasional rescue Newman's Advanced Dog formula. I like this better than the regular Newman's, because it has less ingredients. I supplement with high quality can food, organic free range chicken, healthy powder and salmon oil. My boys are healthy; their coats are amazing. Highly recommend but with supplements--see above."
5,"I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them.  The fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price, was wonderful.  I would definitely make the purchase again.  THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich."
5,"This is such a great blend, very impressive!<br /><br />It has a very complex flavor, and is not flat by any means. I do drink it straight, but I will say you would prob like to use this in milk based drinks more than drinking it straight.<br />When in good milk, has a very earthy chocolatey flavor. Sometimes I think I am drinking hot chocolate! It has a very dense flavor on the tongue, and the first time you drink it you will want to savor every sip to just appreciate the complexity of the blends flavor.<br /><br />I am biased and prefer dark oily roasts. But I always keep a big bag of this in the freezer and have it every day or 2 when making a cappuccino. It also supposedly has less caffeine than the other Lavazza blends, and I can attest to that. Dark roasts sometimes miss the department in complexity with flavor, but sometimes you want a nice strong kick in the morning or in a straight shot. But for all the other times? Get this, very very impressive."
5,"This is a delicious medium bodied coffee that leaves only the lingering taste of the wonderful brew.  You can make it stronger by selecting the smaller cup on your Keurig Brewing System.<br /><br />The Subscribe and Save is the way to go.  Not only saving you money but delivered to your door. Much cheaper here than Target or Costco.......Love it!"
5,"I have a very high tolerance for energy drinks, so I was pleased that this one gave me a noticeable boost in my energy level. I deliberately waited until a morning when I when to bed ultra-late and got up ultra-early, to see how well it would work, and I was pleased. I wasn't bouncing off the walls or anything, but I didn't have any issues with sleepiness and my energy was consistent. Focus also wasn't a problem.<br /><br />Energy drinks tend to have a characteristic sort of 'herbal' taste to them, and this one is no exception, but I actually enjoyed the flavor. It's flavored with grape juice and more generic 'fruit juice' (per the label), and it tastes good- sort of like a carbonated fruit punch. There IS an aftertaste, but it's really mild and brief.<br /><br />I don't normally use or recommend energy drinks, but I enjoyed this one and it worked."
5,"This is the only product I've found that actually has real passion fruit flavor.  My only quibble is that it is a little too sweet for my taste, but at least they don't add high-fructose corn syrup.  Nothing a little lemon or lime... or tequila... can't fix."
5,"This was my first purchase of any gluten free cheese curls and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the crunch.  My husband even likes them and he is very picky about his snack foods. To me they taste better than the other name brand cheese curls and with less fat and calories."
5,"I started finding it a pain to pull the box of kosher salt out of the cupboard, so I decided to buy this, thanks to seeing Alton Brown use it on ""Good Eats"". The look of this item works with our kitchen, as we have granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances. The lid has a gasket which keeps moisture out of the vessel itself. The glass bowl sits perfectly in the metal holder, and can be removed for washing.<br /><br />And excellent buy, for me!"
5,"So this is basically like the display box you'd see at a 7-11 full of pop tarts.  Not that I've actually ever seen pop tarts on display like that.  But that's how it's designed.  The box is the display and the pop tarts (two to a package) aren't in blank foil like the grocery store version - rather, they're in bright colored branded pop tart wrapping. So each packet of two pop tarts looks like something you'd grab off the counter and buy individually.  So that's not a bad thing, just an observation.<br /><br />What's different about the pop tarts themselves is that they appear to be designed NOT to be toasted.  They're actually flakier than the grocery store version so they crumble quite easily when you pull them out of the bag.  Be careful when eating these in your wife's brand new car.  Ahem.  And that makes sense too - because if you were to buy these as an individual serving at a convenience store, odds are you wouldn't have access to a toaster in the first place.  And if you're like me, you don't toast them to begin with.<br /><br />So that being said, if you're not a pop tart toaster, then these are actually better made exactly for that purpose!  Now I haven't toasted one yet so I don't know if they toast just as well, so I can't review on that.  I'll post when I do!  But I can say that quality control of the frosting is MUCH better with these versions over the grocery store version as there's significantly more even distribution of frosting to pastry.  In the grocery store version I've actually had one of my kids throw a pop tarts back at me because of its poor frosting-to-pastry ratio.  Shame on you... whoever you are Mr. Pop Tart Maker!  But in this CostCo sized carton of pop tarts, perhaps because they're chancing that the one pop tart you pull from the box may be your last one, they do a much better job evening out and applying the white gold.<br /><br />So that's it - try it, you'll see what I mean.  It's not worse, it's different, and for grab-n-go non-toasters, you might actually prefer.  I accidentally bought two boxes as well, so I'll let you know how they taste (errr toast?) after the apocalypse being as I'm sure I'll still have plenty by then."
5,"Although I can't make myself eat Pam's chocolate chip cookies (tasteless), these dark chocolate, chocolate chunk cookies are so delicious that I prefer them to other ready-made cookies on the market. And I'm no longer on a gluten-free diet, but still buy them whenever I can and gifted these to my sister and niece who were wowed by them, big time. If you're a chocolate lover at all, these cookies are super chocolatey and satisfying to that great craving. And they're healthy - a big plus for me. And the price at Amazon is terrific. Enjoy!"
5,"Item shipped fast. Taste delicious. This is the second that I bought Graroto here. Highly recommend this to those love Brazil chocolates."
5,"This is the ONLY type of treats my kitty will eat. I've tried buying at least three other types, and she won't have it. This was the first treat she ever got, and its the only one she wants. I like that the top is easily to close and open, and that I can shake it to let her know she's been a good kitty and is going to be rewarded. It's a good training device. Plus they're good for her teeth!"
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GLIMJ0"">Douwe Egberts Aroma Rood Whole Bean Coffee, 1.1 Pound Package</a>My daughter and I first tasted this wonderful coffee while she was confined in the hospital. For five long weeks, she was only cheered by the prospect of getting a good cup of coffee from the visitors' lounge. When she finally was released, we both found ourselves longing for a cup of that wonderful coffee; so I went online to find it. It's going to be a staple in our homes from now on!"
5,"Discovered this wonderful honey mustard in a Havelock, Ontario supermarket and liked it so much took 5 or 6 home with me each summer. About 4 years ago it became available at my local KingKullen. They could not keep it on the shelf and then lo and behold it disappeared. When I inquired I was told the the distributor was not supplying it anymore. Delighted that is now available from Amazon. It is a terrific mustard"
5,"We have a Senseo coffee maker and my wife usually drinks decaf coffee, but she doesn't like the Senseo decaf.  After looking around, these Aloha Island pods seemed like a good (but comparatively expensive!) option, so we tried them.  She loves them - we're absolutely going to keep these on hand from now on."
5,"If you want something different than your plain white or brown rice take a chance and look into this rice, this is real good yummy rice. On top of that this rice is healthier for you than white rice, it is easy to prepare and can be used in other rice dishes, if you like  a change of pace from the normal rice dishes then check this rice out. I love love love this rice and I highly recommend this rice for all you rice lovers like me."
5,"I tried this tea after having a delicious cup of chai tea latte at my favorite caf&eacute; spot.  I decided to try my hand at making my own chait tea latte, using this tea as a basis.  Delicious!  It has the perfect blend of spices and black tea and when mixed with a blend of milk and honey, it's wonderful.  And when made into a latte, it's also filling as a breakfast.  I highly recommend this tea, and if you want to try another great tasting tea, I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6UX8I"">Zhena's Gypsy Tea Fireside Chai, 22 Count, 1.55 Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a> (the gypsy fireside chai tea is actually my favorite)."
5,"My favorite snack ever. Just wish they had more yellow chex pieces, but that's not really Amazon's fault now is it? :)"
5,"When I received my package in the mail it came in a white envelope clearly labeled Red Leaf Tea! I was surprised at how quickly my tea arrived! The matcha itself came in a shiny golden envelope with lovely labeling and the type of matcha I ordered printed on a smaller label stuck on it.<br /><br />When I opened the bag containing my tea the smell was intoxicating! Vanilla, Cream, Butter. Those were the aromas that struck me.<br /><br />It is a pleasing flavor if you like rich, and creamy with a full lingering after taste!<br /><br />It tastes exactly like what you get in the middle of a doughnut! Oh yes...its good! :)<br /><br />This is on the top of my list of favorites from Red Leaf Tea but I dare you to make a list of only 5 or even 10 as they are all so very good!<br /><br />They taste exactly like what they say they will!<br /><br />Impressed as always!"
5,"This hard-to-find candy was a perfect purchase through Amazon. The price was the best compared to any competitor and the candy was fresh and in perfect condition."
5,"If you follow the instructions, you'll have a box filled with lush, green, grass in about a week. The stuff the seeds are in is very light and blows out easily so be careful when you add water. For some odd reason, my cats loved this grass at first but they soon lost interest. They seem to much prefer outside grass. No clue why but it is what it is. In terms of working as intended, this is a good product. I don't think I can fault them because my cats ignored the grass - maybe my cats are just more used to yard grass?"
5,"My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.<br /><br />I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.<br /><br />Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!<br /><br />Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)<br /><br />Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to ""encourage"" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives."
5,"Just got this tea in one of the IntoTeas gift sets and I'm loving it!  It's replaced my morning coffee and it much much healthier than the former with the same amount of caffeine.  Also, I have noticed that the caffeine ""high"" (for lack of a better word) is not as jittery as coffee but still gets the job done and gives me the energy I need in the morning.<br /><br />The taste is fantastic as well, and it's very unique.  I can't quite place all the flavors, other than of course the chai, but I'm very impressed.<br /><br />Here's to hoping the other Teavana teas I've got coming are just as good!"
5,"I enjoy this product and many other Dove products.  The men's wash is hard to find in the stores.I use the wash every day after my gym work outs and it makes me feel great."
5,"If you love macaroon texture and you love almond flavor - these are for you.  They are by far the best cookies I have ever had in a macaroon.  I order them one day, and they are delivered within 2-3 days.  They come fresh, soft, well packaged and wonderful.<br /><br />They freeze well if you get them frozen within a day or two of receipt.  Also, wrap them very very well to maintain their texture."
5,"Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  ""dark brown sugar"" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is ""green cut."" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

Making delicious coffee shop drinks at home every day. I thought 3 bottles would last forever ....I am back a month later to reorder!"
5,"Wolfgang Puck's Colombian coffee is delicious!  I find it to be a smooth and flavorful dark roast with a lovely aroma, yet without a bitter or acidic quality that might leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  It is a bit expensive, like all k-cups, but I think it's worth it due to convenience and exceptional flavor.  I definitely recommend this coffee to others!"
5,"This was my first fruity matcha from Red Leaf and I had really been looking forward to trying it because of the great reviews. The delicious aroma of this selection made my mouth water as soon as I opened the packet. I have enjoyed boysenberry syrup on many occasions in the past, back in the days when I used to eat waffles and pancakes. This definitely captures the essence of boysenberry nicely with a great balance between sweet and tart. I did what others have suggested, and mixed it up with 2 oz of hot water , then added  some almond milk, a splash of cream, a small amount of sweetener, and some ice cubes and shook it up to make a chilled latte. I will eventually try it hot, but I have really been in the mood for the chilled lattes lately! So this was the third flavor I've had from Red Leaf, and all have been outstanding. I'm afraid they could be somewhat addictive. If you haven't tried boysenberry, you should! I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,"What is not to like about the finer American Chocolates?  A piece a day keeps the dentis happy!  (and the sugar nuts crazy!)"
5,"This is a great product.  So easy to use,  makes consistent coffee every time"
5,"I used to like Oregon Chai - but then my friend gave me a big bag of this.  I wasn't thrilled at first but now I LOVE IT!!!!  I tried Oregon Chai again and cannot go back.  Big Train is soo good.  I sometimes heat it with water and then add some dry milk.  It's tasty that way and I'm not using up all of the regular milk."
5,"My son and I love the flavor of this soup and use it as a side dish with sour cream and salsa. My favorite one of all the soups!"
5,"I've been eating, actually devouring & loving, Joray Apricot fruit rolls since the late 1960's. I'm presently 46 and I love them as much today as I did when I unfurled my first roll nearly 40 year's ago. In my humble opinion, they're the best fruit snack I've ever had the arrant pleasure of savoring. One further note of interest; the Joray Apricot fruit rolls have been difficult to locate of late. I've searched my local super-markets, as well as continuously perused the Web, and occasionally have been fortunate enough to locate a box. Amazon.com, thus far, remains the only trustworthy website I'd buy from. Other sites I've ordered from failed to deliver my orders which ranged from one box to five boxes. If you're like me and you're addicted to these fine fruit snacks, do yourself a huge favor and purchase them from Amazon.com. And it's not like I'm being paid for rendering Amazon.com kudos for a job well done, as well as for their professionalism, with regard to dealing with the public at large and for offering, actually gauranteeing, swift delivery. Amazon deserves to be commended for providing a fantastic product, as does Joray, and I thank them both..!!!<br /><br />[...]"
5,"I thought this creamer was a bit high but since it only takes 1/2 as much as all the other creamers i've bought over the years - it's a bargain & I really like the vanilla flavor !"
5,"I'm not one to write reviews, only when I love / hate the product and for one thing, I HATE coconuts. However, I first tried the passion fruit flavored Zico and thought, this doesn't taste like coconuts at all! I loved the taste and soon got addicted to how good I felt post workouts. I tried the other mango flavor, and liked it too, so thought I'd venture to the natural coconut one. To my surprise, it wasn't what I remembered coconuts tasted like, in fact, it was more refreshing than the other flavors!<br />I love the new bottle Zico has come out with, it makes drinking and cooling Zico so much easier. The Lime and Pomberry additions are amazing! The bottles make traveling with it easier, and now, I don't have to drink in one sitting.<br />Best time to drink a Zico though is after a hard night of partying. I don't know what it is, but after a night of drinking, I always reach for a Zico and the next morning, its as if nothing happened the night before. I'm a firm believer in the natural remedies of coconuts now, post workout, post drinking, post anything where you exert energy. I still won't eat a real coconut, but I will drink a Zico. I've tried the other brands out there and cannot stomach it, but for some reason, love Zico."
5,"This coconut oil is fantastic for all my culinary needs, works great in stir fry, smoothies, raw cookies, etc.<br />I also love that it's organic."
5,"While sitting next to a boatload of sauces right now, I can honestly say this is the best tasting of the bunch.<br />Heres a rundown:<br />Melinda's XXXXtra Reserve -- decent, but not that hot<br />Asbirin Extra Strength -- obscenely salty<br />Ass Blaster -- salty and vinegary<br />Dave's Ghost Pepper -- bitter and nasty, it has a creeper heat to it<br />Mad Dog 357 -- hot as hell, probably a contender but only for certain foods since its too sweet for me<br />Dave's Insanity/Temp Insanity -- good, no real complaint, just not as good<br />Da' Bomb &lt;all> -- taste is ok, heat is unbearable<br />Pain 95/100% -- decent sauces but not that hot<br />Mad Dog Pure Ghost -- tastes like the 357, only not hot at all<br />El Yucateca Green/Xtra Hot -- these are good sauces with minor heat, too minor for me<br />Mad Dog 357 Mustard Sauce -- great stuff, limited usage due to flavor profile, pretty warm<br />Pappy's Moonshine Madness -- awesome, but its a barbecue sauce, decent heat for such<br /><br />So, based upon all that experience right there, I recommend this sauce for flavor and heat as a primary ""use on whatever"" sauce. I just ate a spoonful off of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E7S5BO"">Light My Fire Titanium Spork</a> and its great all by itself. I barely pull a burn from it. I highly doubt its 550,000 rating. My bottle of Mad Dog 357 is hands down at least 2x/3x as hot -- confirmed by testing just now in the same amount. I'm actually starting to wonder if there was some mistake or I got a fluke bottle of 357, because its the hottest thing I have aside from my Da' Bomb lineup. It literally sets my mouth on fire and feels more like about 650,000. I have and have eaten some Da' Bomb Final Answer and this is around half that heat or so I think. I don't have the collector's edition either.... Oh well, YMMV. Have fun chileheads!<br /><br />Update: I got the Mad Dog collectors edition in the mail today. It is twice as hot as the original so there that is. I also have Ultra Death sauce now too. Its not much hotter than the Mega Death that I can tell. I'm thinking that the Mad Dog line may be the truest to its claimed Scoville rating that I have come across. Everything else has been all over the board, no wonder you have to be careful testing sauces. Go hit some Ground Zero with 214,000(my ass) Scoville rating."
5,"This was very tasty tea and the company had great customer service.  Their product is very healthy and I'd recommend it to anyone."
5,"If you like lemons you will love this marmalade.  Shreds of lemon rind throughout.  Very hard to find and I was so happy when I found a source on Amazon."
5,"This is the second 54-ounce jar I have purchased. The first time I went through a different website. It must have melted during shipping, so when I got it, it had leaked out of the top a bit. This time it came in perfect condition! Great value for the money!"
5,"We just bought our first Belgian waffle maker and based on other reviewers bought this mix.  It is delicious.  The waffles cooked up crisp on the ouside with a light, fluffly texture on the inside.  Great flavor & everyone raved about them.  I am not a cook that typically takes the easy road and prefer homemade recipes and avoid box mixes.  But I'm sold on this and am hard pressed to think I'm going to take the time to make them from scratch.  Just be forewarned that based on the amount of batter your individual iron requires per waffle you may not get as many waffles as the box states you'll get.  Two pouches are supposed to make about 10 waffles and we got about half that."
5,"This does provide 5 hours of energy, no crash at the end, and no jitters during the boost."
5,"These are k-cups, great price and great flavor came really fast it was a good product. These are the best deal online for k-cups"
5,"we have 8 little and big dogs...they all like these and they are good training size...They smell like an oatmeal cookie...um...Ingredients are pretty good too..."
5,"Everything from shipping, packaing, speed, product quality, health benefits, etc. is GOOD! Amazon shipped it fast with an AWESOME (new) packaging style. Very secured and safe. Honey tastes very good. I'm a honey person and have tried many out there, especially high-end ones. Some of them give me diarrhea, which is on top of my regular stomach problems. My digestive and colon systems are very sensitive. After a couple days taking this...I feel great (and normal again)! No worries of looking for a bathroom when going out. It's really worth the money..believe me :)"
5,"This is the best one we have found for our Kuerig Brewer........everyone loves it. Kids, husband, and me!"
5,"This a my favorite Altoid flavor by far, it is very tasty, it is however pretty ""hot"" so if you do not like heat these mints are not for you. I am the only one in my family who really likes them they can be intense but then I love Atomic Fire Balls as well."
5,"This is the first time I've ever done one of these reviews. I bought my aerogarden back in February and I absolutely love it! It's easy to set up and maintain and I have more herbs than I know what to do with. Before I got it, it would just kill me to make a dish calling, for example, 2 tbls. of fresh basil, parsley and cilantro. That would mean having to buy about $10 worth of herbs and then only using a small fraction of them. This product will pay for itself many times over!"
5,"Not just salty water and color.  You can definitely taste the olives in this mix.  This is even better than the brine from those bulk cocktail olive restaurants use!"
5,"The Bahlsen Delobas are my favorite so far. Call them biscuits or call them cookies they are just plain good. Light and pastry like with a nice burst of sweetness from the red current jam. Try Them!"
5,"It's awesome.  Extremely intense flavor.  Also, it makes an incredible dark and stormy if you mix it with a good dark rum."
5,"I was so happy to find these after eating at a German restaurant and sampling spaetzle noodles.  These work well in many dishes from soups to casseroles and the size of the box is (9 ounces)is a good size for two people.  Delicious and a Great Product!"
5,"when i first tried this, i like it right away!  great option for vegetarians and vegans especially if you used to eat meat and enjoy foods with tough textures.  the peppy pepperoni is my favorite flavor out of all of them but the rest are good too."
5,"This tahini is from Lebanon.  Its flavor is fresh and it has a wonderful consistency.  I have found all the products I have bought from Lebanon have been excellent.  They are the best to recommend!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZI5U2W"">Al Wadi Tahina, Ground Sesame 100%, 32-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a>"
5,"This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes."
5,"This is the most wonderful snack around.  I love, love these chili rice crackers.  Did I say how much I love these crackers!"
5,"This is a real gourmet product. You can add them to melon cut in dices and it makes an excellent entr&eacute;e. You can add to ice cream as well,and unless you are anti alcohol, no one will be dissapointed, but probably most surprised, it's delicious.<br />We discovered this in a fancy gourmet store in the heart of France, and are very pleased that it is also available in the US and Canada."
5,"These treats are great! My Charley loves them. They are kind of like hard oyster crackers. They are not moist meaty treats that stick inside you pockets. I do recommend them."
5,"This is the 2nd time I've order these Wasabi Rice Crackers from this vendor and I will continue to do so.  They are shipped promptly and with the cost of shipping they are still less expensive than I can buy the locally."
5,"We gave this to our grandsons with a movie.  Since we cannot take them to a movie, they can enjoy the hot Chocolate with their wives and see the movie at home.  Great little extra for them."
5,"Great tasting and plenty of spice. I like it hot. (not insane hot, but hot) This fits the bill. Taste like it is made with top quality ingredients. The best tasting hot BBQ sauce I have found."
5,"I wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as I think the 4.5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves. However, I think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the Internet, especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option. I would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality."
5,"I first tasted this tea at my local PF Chang's restaurant and was immediately impressed. I am a long-time tea drinker and buying teas on a regular basis from different sources- from Teavana to small boutique tea houses . This one is  an outstanding green tea for everyday use. You will not find a better price and quality. Disregard the incoorectly posted reviews and enjoy this addicitively smooth, yet potent brew."
5,"This product was perfect for my daughter's 4th grade report on Germany.  She gave away gummi bears to show a sampling of a German product.  Lots of bears for a great price!"
5,"I just discovered a new flavor of Larabar:  Carrot Cake.  I love carrot cake, and this bar is awesome.  It tastes just like carrot cake.  The yummy, scrumptious ingredients of dates, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, unsweetened coconut, carrots, cinnamon, and extra virgin olive oil all put together is heavenly.  This is one of my favorite flavors of Larabars.<br /><br />I can't sing enough praises for Larabars:  good taste, healthy, convenient.  It's good to have a few (or a lot) on hand in case you get a little hungry or weak.<br /><br />And, oh, I must mention:  These bars are created and made in Colorado.  I know, that has nothing to do with the goodness of these bars.  But Colorado is my new favorite state, so I mentioned it.  The goodness of these bars are just as wonderful as Colorado is beautiful.  And if you know how breathtaking Colorado is, then you know I am comparing these bars to something awesome.  Awesome, healthy, tasty bars that are convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.<br /><br />Carrot cake highly recommended if you like carrot cake."
5,"...and something seems to be working! It could be this alfalfa tea which tastes just like...alfalfa tea. My aunt has pain too and does not like to be without this tea."
5,"I purchased the large 15 count pork chomps and my dog loves them. They are way better than regular rawhides and they last longer too, not too mention they are healthier and won't expand in your dog's tummy. Will definitely purchase again."
5,"These are great to have!  I toss one in my daughter's lunch...have a few in my purse for a ""pick"" me up, etc.  Tasty, tasty!  Other people are so curious when I whip one out.  They are amazed it's a straw filled with honey.  This is the place to find the best price on these honey sticks.  Thanks for having them on subscribe and save.  Great program!"
5,"Ordered this for my grandson's birthday to be used in his new popcorn machine that I also ordered for his birthday.  He loves this popcorn."
5,"Was waiting for our airplane & wanted something healthy to snack on - to my delightful surprise, I found your product (Multigrain one), looked at all the numbers on the back of the package & was amazed how good they were; then was further amazed how good tasting they were.  To my further delight, I have now found them in my local market (Vons in California)and want to try all flavors - then I shall order from you via the internet for more savings.  Thank you so much for the people who developed this product!!  Tina in CA"
5,"My vet recommended that we use this product for a special ""treat"" for our dogs.  We don't have Bulldogs but my dogs go crazy when we pull out the container and give them these chunks as treats for good behavior.  It's nutritious and good for them and they think they are getting something really special!"
5,"The First Time I Try  GINGER TREE  GINGER ALE .I  WAS AT THE CASINO LOUNGE  SO I TRACK IT DOWN ON LINE AND ORDER A CASE OF 24  I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. I DRINK CANADA DRY ALL OF THE TIME. BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER AND SMOOTH. IT CAN BE MIX WITH ALMOST ANYTHING ESPECIALLY WHISKEY OR Just ALONE. KEEP UP THE GOOD JOB I CAN'T WAIT TO ORDER MORE....GINGER"
5,"Keurig brewers product, tastes great, brews quickly, and disposes of easily,  will definately purchase this product again in the future. Price again a factor - and delivered right to your door."
5,"I bought this kombu with the idea that I would make dashi (Japanese broth) but I found it is also good for making pickled vegetables. I put cukes, daikon, raw green peppers, and anything else that I would like in a crunchy salad, in a glass jar with some sea salt, leaving it in the refrigerator. The vegetables give up their juices and soak in a brine of salt and juice.<br />  The vegetables stay crunchy and flavorful. I put them on hamburgers and in salads. Even on a cracker with some cream cheese!<br /> Shredded kombu (cut it with scissors after it has soaked a good long while in the salad) is a flavorful addition."
5,"This product is very good and the supplier was very prompt in shipment.  Expectations of this product and the service were far exceeded.  Superb."
5,"This product is great I have bought the tea from a grocery store before and it is pricey I am so glad I found this because it is such a good deal and the packaging cuts down on the waste"
5,"I love all things hot and Chipotle peppers are on the top of my list.  I usually buy pounds of dried Chipotles during the Hatch, New Mexico Chile Festival.  The heat of Chipotles are not overbearing (they are, after all, smoked Jalapenos) but the taste is warm and full of flavor.<br /><br />I had been buying the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T8XGW"">La Costena Chipotle Adobo Sauce</a> and liked them fine.  I recently tried the Roland brand and found them to be even better.  The sauce seems richer and the peppers hotter.<br /><br />I often chop these up and mix them into ground beef for Chipotle burgers or, if I include to Adobo sauce, I can make Chipotle meatloaf with it.  I keep several cans of both this and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046LCJZ8"">Roland Chipotle paste</a> on hand and I use them often.  They taste great to me!"
5,"1st I have to say the customer service is excellent!!! I misunderstood the item I bought, thought I was getting 6 of them. Lawrence contacted me as soon as the payment went thru to confirm the item. Thank you. I not only bought one.....but I just had to buy 6 more! We use this on everything!!! Pastrami sandwich here I come.<br />Thank you Honest Foods for great service and communication!!!"
5,"Full flavor, smooth taste, pleasantly surprised.  I received the coffee maker and the coffee for Christmas, but wasn't sure how well a ""single cup of coffee"" could be made.  Wow!!!  One of my best gifts ever."
5,"I love this gum and could no longer get it any where here in Wyoming. So I tried the internet and here it was. Thanks so much."
5,"We have sampled a good number of different coconut juices from different companies and these Amy & Brian juices are the best, hands down. A number of the other brands had a bitter taste and/or after taste, or seemed watered down (lacked flavor). Amy & Brian's juice is sweet through and through, no nasty after taste, and reasonably priced.<br /><br />The only thing I think they could do better is to package the juice in a better container. It is somewhat annoying to drink the juice from the can due to the ""tinny"" taste and because the pulp pieces zip through the small opening, which is disconcerting. I just pour it out into a glass and enjoy it fully that way. Another brand we tried had a glass, wide-mouth container which was easy to drink from and cool because you can see the pulp pieces suspended in the drink. If Amy & Brian adopted packaging like that, it would improve the product by a lot!<br /><br />Still though, despite the packaging, this is THE BEST coconut juice out there that we have tried."
5,"This stuff is FANTASTIC.  Throw salmon in skillet, sprinkle some of this on, and voila!  Most delicious home-cooked salmon you'll ever have, no sauce necessary."
5,"for some reason, this flavor is no longer available in any of the grocery stores around here.  thank goodness for amazon.  the taste is great and the calorie count even better.  thanks!"
5,"I love the Rasam rice, and is very close to home-made rasam. I eat it with papadam, I love the combo. It is like comfort food."
5,"Arrived early, in good condition. Sealed and fresh just like I would have bought it at the pet store, and for 5 bucks cheaper."
5,"Absolutely my favorite pretzels.....will be getting more!! Very soft & stays fresh. Wish these could be bought in a store though!!"
5,"These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites."
5,"I am 13 weeks pregnant with twins and really suffering with severe morning sickness. These are the ONLY thing that I have found to relieve nausea! They are quite strong but worth it for the relief you get from constant nausea. I actually like the taste myself!"
5,"This is delicious hot or cold! There is enough that I could share w/family & friends. The flavor is strong & doesn't need that much of a sweetener."
5,"My family loves these chips.  We bought a huge box of them for my son's bar mitzvah and they were a hit at the party.  The company makes a great product and they ship very quickly.  You can buy small bags or larger quantities.  Order them and you will find that not only isn't one chip enough, one bag isn't enough.  Also the price on Amazon is amazing.  Enjoy!"
5,"By far the best stevia.  I've tried others, but none compare to this brand.  I go through a lot of this particular product in smoothies and green drinks."
5,"I'm not a huge flavored coffee person, but I really love these! The coffee is mild to medium bodied and the flavoring isn't overpowering. It's got a great aroma (the co-worker next to me always loves when I brew one of these) and a clean, distinct taste.<br /><br />I've got these on Subscribe and Save!"
5,"My cat is 10 years old and he used to get UTI's ALL the time(like every few months) not only was his vet bills expensive, I hated that he was in pain. I used the very expensive food I bought from the vet for cats who get lots of UTI's but since I am not Donald Trump I decided to give the Purina One Urinary Tract food a try. For years my cat didn't have a single UTI so one day at the store when they were out of the Purina One, I decided to give a cheaper Urinary Tract cat food a try. Within a month my cat was whining in the litter box and I knew he had another UTI. I took him to the Vet and sure enough, he had another UTI.<br /><br />I immediately went to the store and bought him Purina One Urinary Tract and that is what he has been on ever since. I will NEVER again try a different brand of cat food, that was over 4 years ago since I tried the cheaper cat food and he hasn't had a single UTI since. My cat LOVES his food, he is very picky but thankfully he loves his UTI formula.<br /><br />If you have a cat who gets UTI's I totally recommend giving this food a try. It costs more than the cheaper food but what it saves me in vet bills and having a happy & healthy Kitty is well worth it : )"
5,"Eight O'Clock is the best tasting morning coffee at any price.  I've been drinking it for years and haven't found anything better."
5,"These are the best pretzel snack out there.  The broken pieces really soak up the flavor which a whole pretzel would not.<br /><br />And what everybody else said!"
5,"This almond product is wonderful!  I am so excited to have healthy options that curb my sweet tooth.  It has on 5 sugars for an ounce of almonds.<br /><br />Wahoo!"
5,"We used these in making ""Cherry Bread"" in our bread machine. Works really well with a sweet dough recipe. The price is good at this time. These cherries are not overly sweet, but have a more of a tart to them. They also hold together well in our machine. They also make a good substitute for raisins in trail mixes. We store our excess in Mason Jars in fridge. Recommend them highly."
5,"I bought these so I could get free Super Saver Shipping. Well, my dog LOVES these! She doesn't like to share, so she will take her biscuit into her crate to eat at her leisure. They are not super hard, they have a bit of softness to them, so it's not all ""crunchy crunchy."" They are a nice size for my medium-sized dog. It's the only way she'll let me trim her nails--offer her a treat, and she'll lay there until I finish and give her a Woofer. Gotta love that!"
5,"Decided to give the Moroccan soup a try.  Wow!  Great flavor and texture.  Robust and thick.  Would highly recommend it.  Can't wait to try the other flavors."
5,"One of the best tasting cocoa mix I have found , So easy to make just one cup for myself and the cup is<br />easy to clean with no grounds invovlved. Use with K cup lids"
5,"My husband and I love Kodiak cakes and make them often on weekends. We add some blueberries or bananas to the batter and top them with natural crunchy peanut butter and agave syrup (instead of maple). If you are interested, you can check out my full review here: [...]"
5,"I am a lifelong celiac who has had to avoid oats.  I ordered the Lara oats a few months ago to try them and have had great success.  The oats themselves are high quality and taste very good.  My wife likes having oats to use in baking again.  Had them in meatloaf as well.  I make oatmeal in the morning.  I followed the suggestion on the box that you start slowly in incorporating them in your gluten-free diet, and have had no problems.  I am back at the item now because I am placing another order.  Enjoy."
5,"I haven't sampled this myself but I can tell my dog really loves it because he eats it all literally every time I put it down. In the past with other foods he has let it sit out for a few hours before finishing it. We started him on this type of dog food about 6 months ago because of some elevated liver numbers and his numbers are down now and he has lost a few pounds too. So, it's a win win for us. He loves the taste and it is healthier for him. 5/5 stars."
5,"We tried Swheat Scoop strait off when we got our new kitten.  We liked it pretty well, but decided to shop around a bit.  We tried World's Best and were not impressed.  It was really light so she when she dug in litter box it ended up all over the ground, second, we did not enjoy the corn smell and did not feel like it masked odors as well as Swheat Scoop.  We next tried Feline Pine- we did not get through the whole box. It tracked everywhere!  Not to mention it did not clump at all.  So we are back to using Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />Reasons we like Swheat Scoop<br />-Controls oder wonderfully<br />-Does not track too much<br />-Is safe for little kitties<br />-Clumps well for easy scooping<br />-Is flushable!<br />-Is cheaper than other clay-free litters."
5,"Love the taste, esp at this price. Cheaper than at the store, and it comes to the door. I don't have to carry and put in the car."
5,"I don't write reviews unless I feel strongly about something.  My dog was recently diagnosed with lymphoma.  I read that a grain free diet can be beneficial to dogs with cancer.  So I did some research on brands and this was recommended. I bought it locally, not on Amazon, but wanted to write a review anyway.  My dog had pretty much stopped eating for several days.  I bought both canned and dried of this.  Gave him half a can to start and he scarfed it down.  Gave him the other half and he scarfed that down.  Next meal gave him dry and he ate that heartily too.  He just LOVES this food.  Our next dog, I will start right out on this food since I have learned that dogs are not really built to eat grains and this is such a good dog food,  It is worth the extra cost."
5,"I've tried every single flavor of Pop Chips they make.  They are all tasty, but barbecue is IT for me!  These have been my salvation while dieting.  One serving practically fills an entire cereal bowl, but has way less fat and calories than traditional chips.  I'm hooked!  I highly recommend trying these!"
5,"My dog lives for these treats!  Can't wait to see us leave in the morning when I give him a few."
5,"So happy to get my favorite pudding, don't know why they don't still sell in the store. They brought out a bunch of new flavors, that have already gone away. They need to bring back this one. It is in a different box than it was in the store, but yes it is the same (yummy). Buying a case seemed a hard way to get a box of pudding, but when you have been craving something for a long time, well you just got to do it. I Just put the extra case and all in the freezer and bring out a box a little ahead of cooking it. Haven't had any problems."
5,"Love this.  Even shared it with meat eaters who liked it. A little messy but still great on the go for a tasty protein snack."
5,"I was stunned at how much my cats love these Whiskas Temptations.  Some of the other flavors weren't so thrilling but this one is a winner."
5,"Arrived within a week, just as planned, and these soups taste awesome.  They are extremely easy to store and prepare, and are also composed of quality ingredients.  Highly recommended for travel, camping, or even for a lunch break at school or work.  All that is needed is water, a heating source, and a spoon."
5,"When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.<br /><br />I am glad that they still taste the same.<br />Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.<br /><br />Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!<br /><br />And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!<br /><br />I recommend the good ol' slim jim!"
5,"This is, without a doubt, the best GF baked product I have ever tasted. Even my wife, who can eat whatever she wants, thinks it tastes great. Prep time is a tad long at about 15-20 mins for an inexperienced baker such as myself, but well worth it. I did add about double the cinnamon to the topping along with a sprinkling of xylitol. I also used real natural butter."
5,"These pretzels are yummy!  I can't stop eating them!  Just placed a second order within a week!  I am addicted."
5,"I first bought these at Whole Foods and enjoyed them immensely.  I now keep them at my desk for when I need a pick me up while working.  Definitely a snack-type essential for me."
5,"This is awesome. Yes you will want two bags after you purchase this product. Delicious. So much better then the Bunny stuff we are used to.  Love Raw Cacao"
5,"I first tried this k-cup as a sample.  I was hesitant at first because most teas for the Keurig brewer are either bland, weak, or both.  The sample I tried came in a pack of 4 different iced tea flavors from Celestial Seasonings.  They were are suprisingly very good brewed over ice.  But, this one was by far my favorite.  It has a nice blend of ""teaness"" and lemon-y sweetness.  A pack of equal or splenda really brightens up the flavors.  I was instantly hooked and ordered a big box of this stuff on Amazon right after trying this drink.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there is one big caveat to this drink.  It is a caloric drink.  So, if you are looking to restrict your caloric intake in terms of sugary beverages, becareful with this k-cup.  There isn't a whole lot of calories (about 1/2 a can of soda's worth), but it's still there and considering how good this drink is, it's hard to just drink 1.  Other than that, I think this is the best non-coffee beverage available on the Keurig brewer."
5,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the pouches open easily. They don't reseal, but that's fine because there are never leftovers."
5,"Excellent coffee. I rarely ask restaurants about the coffee they brew, but last year I was so taken by the coffee that I asked and was told it was Douwe Egberts Dark European Roast. I was unable to find that particular roast, but this one is excellent as well, offering a bold flavor without being bitter."
5,"I'm actually drinking this as I type. So this is my PMS-y review.<br /><br />This tea makes me... not feel homicial? Okay that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I do have a big emotional jump the week before my period. Seems to make the cramps lighter and the period shorter as well. On the box it says it helps to flush the kidney of the excess hormones or something like that- which explains a lot.<br /><br />The taste leaves something to be desired. I describe it as, ""Cigarette Butt Water,"" sadly, I know how this tastes ;Q but hey, my palate is a bit less sophisticated than some. With a tablespoon or more of honey it tastes ok. I'm not dropping a star because of that, it's tea, I drink a lot of them, they work. Sometimes they taste good, sometimes they don't.<br /><br />I definitely recommend trying this if you feel a bit crazy or achy before and during your period."
5,"My dog loves the treats!!! I have a yorkie and they are just the right size for him. I let a friend give her dog some and they loved them also."
5,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend as a Gold Box special.  She's recently become a ""tea snob"" so being the sensitive guy that I am, I figured this would get right in on her good side.  This gift set was 100% successful with that.  The bamboo box is unique and reusable.  The small tea pot is the perfect size for brewing a couple cups of whatever her favorite tea is that day.  The real gem however, are the flowering teas themselves.  They're basically dried tea leaves and dried flowers hand sewn together so that when you pour hot water over them they magically bloom right before your eyes.  Pretty neat even to a stilted coffee drinker.<br /><br />She says the tea tastes great too so I guess that's a plus."
5,"A mung bean is a fuel capsule full of all the nutrition required to create life. By germinating the mung beans you unlock the nutrients & enzymes that lay dormant within the bean. Once germinated I blend them into a batter with a little salt and water. In a large skillet I heat 1/3 cup of coconut oil at high heat and pour a couple of tablespoons of the mung bean batter on the skillet (like a small pancake (about 4 per skillet) I fry them till golden brown on both sides. I love them  plain or drizzled with maple syrup or honey.  I also love them when mixed with chopped raw spinach and green onions. I add a beaten egg white, cumin powder and cayenne pepper. They are just amazingly delicious and so healthy!  Here are instructions how to germinate mung beans and how to make mung bean pancakes  [...]"
5,"I bought this product to calm heart palpitations that were caused by a magnesium deficiency. After taking it as directed for a couple of weeks, the palpitations had pretty well stopped. I continue to take it daily."
5,"Island Coconut is so calming - it reminds me of the islands.  You can really taste the coconut and paired w/Caffe D'Vita  Hawaiian Mocha, it's my favorite."
5,"Yellow grits have not been available in our local supermarkets for quite some time, so when I needed some to make my new favorite, Zea's Corn Grits, I searched online.  The first brand that I tried made much of being ""stone ground"", but the texture when cooked was too coarse for the dish.  These Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Corn Grits were my second purchase, and they have the perfect texture.  They cook quickly and are full of good corn flavor.  Highly recommended."
5,"Very fine powder.  Make sure you shake it good.  Organic.  Only good things to say about it.  No stomach aches."
5,"If you order this on the ""subscribe and save"", you will save more than by ordering it from the Tassimo Direct Order. I absolutely love this morning blend because it makes a HUGE cup of coffee to get me going in the mornings."
5,"I enjoyed the Salba much more so than flax seeds.  It has a nice nutty taste and can be mixed well with oatmeal or eaten alone.  I didn't find that it gave me more energy as some websites have purported, but knowing it is good for me is enough for me."
5,"My dog has never stopped loving these treats for over a year.<br /><br />Service was great and shipping was prompt."
5,"I like these...very addictive tho.  Just bought the EXACT same bag at CostCo for half the price....<br /><br />Opened and tried them and went back in and bought 2 more bags!!"
5,"We all know how graham crackers taste like by now.  We've used them in our ginger bread houses back from elementary school building our marshmallow buildings.  Okay if that wasn't you, it's fine.  Back to Nature's Golden Honey Oat graham crackers - they are perfect for the health conscious afternoon snacker.  They're 100% natural (no preservatives, flavors, colors, and no high fructose corn syrup).  They're similar size to your Honey Maid crackers but does taste more natural.  There's more of a crunch to them and you can see the dried pieces of oats on top.  They're slightly less sweet as the Honey Maid brand but overall very satisfying."
5,"I was hesitant to spend $10 on three plastic discs, which looked cheap and flimsy in the images. The are actually hard plastic, and thick. They do work very well. Very easy to use and clean. I would highly recommend trying them out."
5,"The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Dog Chews is one of three steps that have worked well at removing tartar from my dog's teeth. I give her two a day, one in the morning, one at night, and her teeth look better and whiter than before.<br /><br />But remember, these are not a substitute for brushing and rinsing your dog's teeth. Make sure you continue to brush and/or rinse your dog's mouth and teeth after giving your dog a hygiene chew.<br /><br />Other customers have complained that their dogs choke or have a difficult time swallowing the remains of the chew after it has softened. I've experienced this a few times, but my medium-sized dog seems to gain control of the chew after a few wears on it. For the most part, the medium-sized chews are large enough for dogs that weigh between 11 and 25 pounds.<br /><br />Following the three steps to better hygiene (chew, rinse, brush), your dog's teeth will look cleaner, whiter and a whole lot healthier in the weeks and months that follow.<br /><br />T.B. Grant<br />7.8.12"
5,"I was skeptical about buying these in a can, but they are every bit as good as fresh. Plain with lemon or with food, you can't go wrong. Plus, the price is right."
5,"I love these chips, the Chili Nacho is definitely the best flavor.  I prefer the individual bags because they are one serving, but these are the best chips and so healthy for you!  Plus, they are made right here in my home state of MN! :)"
5,"I love this cereal and any other Kay's Naturals products. I have tried their cereals, Almond Bites and Crackers. They offer a great taste and perfect balance of carbs, fat and protein. The almond taste is just enough. Team it up with almond milk and you've got an awesome bowl of cereal."
5,"I haven't eaten other Jack's products, but this one is great - bought on impulse, which I seldom do.  Kind of wish I wouldn't have as I can see these becoming a craved addiction.  As other's have said, they're a little spicy, but certainly not hot.  As a grease-o-phobe, I didn't find them greasy at all."
5,"This product has been a favorite of mine for many years. To be able to purchase this 72-ounce is not only a bargain but also a great convenience. I use this product daily to enhance several beverages such as tea, lemonade, orange drink etc. Very please with this product!"
5,"I have been drinking this tea for many years and absolutely love it both hot, iced and lukewarm.  If it is too strong for you, use a larger cup or glass and water it down.  One bag can go a long way and it is deliscious without sweeteners.  Best price I have seen in years."
5,"I love these individual packages!  Now I don't have to waste half a can if only one person wants it.  My sister sends these in her husbands lunch.  They're great!"
5,"I found that coffee wasn't agreeing with me. I had no experience with tea but sent for Bigelow Chai Green Tea on a whim. I'm happy with the taste and apparent health benefits. I'll continue to order these k-cups."
5,"This bouillon is great. I use it almost daily in my cooking. Unfortunately my local grocery store stopped selling it so I'am so pleased I could find it here. I received it fast and without damage and will continue to buy it regularily."
5,"My male Van is very picky with his litter, but ever since I have started using this regularly he has not had one single accident or urinated on any other surface than in his box.  Great litter, great price."
5,"My dog loves these. Totally unaware that she is taking a pill. The pockets are nice and soft, and can be squished around to totally cover the pill. My dog doesn't seem to know the difference of flavors, so I just get the ones that gives me the most for the least dollars and cents. It's only a small price difference, but, hey, it is a difference."
5,"Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!"
5,"These make giving pills much easier.  We have two cats that take multiple pills each day and I can mold a pill pocket around two or even three pills and pop them into a cat's mouth without much trouble.  Unlike other reviewers I can't just put a pill in a pill pocket and let our cat eat it because when he chews the pill becomes separated from the pocket.  But he's happy for me help him swallow it whole.<br /><br />And here's a tip: Moisten the pill pocket just before giving it to the cat and it will go down more smoothly.  This is helpful with a cat with a small mouth and throat, like a Persian, or with pockets wrapped around big pills.<br /><br />These soft Pill Pockets may not appeal to cats that are used to only dry food and dry treats.  But the pockets are still helpful to hold several pills together."
5,"This was a gift and the receiver just loves this product. She said that it is something new each day and wants it again for next Christmas!"
5,"I like trying different salts, so when i saw this, i had to snag a jar for myself. It actually arrived early, which was nice.<br />The taste is quite bright, and is a great finisher. I just tried it with chicken, and it really made the flavor pop. I plan to try it on a chocolate mousse next.<br />An interesting by product is that since it is made in part from lava rock, it actually leaves a residue on your hands when you handle it.<br />Anyway, pretty neat and quite inexpensive. As long as you arent copiously coating all your food with it, this jar should last a while.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this salt on a variety of things, including eggs, various meats, fresh tomatoes (from my garden), as well as the aforementioned chocolate mousse (which i had been planning when i wrote the review initially) and chicken. It has continued to be a wonderful addition to my kitchen, and the tomatoes and chocolate mousse in particular stood out as bar none winners."
5,"My baby loves them and so do I!!  Tried them 4 years ago with my first and now with my 9 month old and they're still a great snack!!  Only complaint is that once the canister is opened, the product gets soft pretty fast."
5,"I have had digestive problems for years without any real relief provided by over the counter antacids, etc. I tried this tea to see if I could get any relief for bloating, gas, and cramping. I found this tea to be a good product - I did feel like it worked much better than antacids and the gas-x type products. I thought drinking 2-3 cups of this tea daily really helped with the gas, bloat and cramping. I will definitely buy it again."
5,"MY DOGS LOVE THEM, HOWEVER TENDENCY IS TO GIVE TOO MANY, AS THEY BEG FOR THEM.  THEY RECOMMEND 2 PER DAY AND I FIND THAT HARD TO STICK TO."
5,"These treats are perfect for training. They taste AMAZING - I eat them myself, too! They're small, they dissolve quickly, and they're fairly smelly. The only thing that could make these better is if they were grain-free."
5,"I have 8 month twins and they love this milk. I prefer it to other well known brands as it mixes well and doesn't have alot of bubbles and froth.<br />Its expensive but worth it knowing your kids are getting organic milk."
5,"my french mastiff  is fussy about her treats. she will not eat all but she loves these slivers"
5,"These are the BEST of the line from Terra, but why are the zesty tomato missing from all stores? Why can't we find them anywhere? What is up?"
5,"Tasty little things. A very compelling chewiness. However, go slow at first until you know how many you can handle or you will be your family's flatulence champion (or villain, depending on your family)."
5,"We love this peanut sauce mix and have it for dinner a few times each month.  It's easy to make and tastes awesome.  Order some cans of coconut milk to go with this while you're at it!"
5,"This product is available COLD for $1.99 each RETAIL.<br /><br />Even less in the four pack, or ""case"" of 12."
5,"These were my kids favorite.  No orange mess and a light crunchy texture."
5,"Before Ordering,I read some reviews here that claimed that the bags weren't worth buying.But i decided to try them once and had no problems with them.They were reasonably priced,quite colorful and hold up well. Would definitely order again."
5,"I am a dad who likes to get things in bulk so I can stock up and save while getting quality stuff for my kids. My wife does the picking of which organic stuff we buy. She tries them all with the kids and the best match up so far has been the Ella line. They haven't gotten bored of them for 6 month straight now. Not bad. But within that brand, it's the sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apples, and blueberries that both kids will gobble up. I think it's the combination of the purple packaging and the blueberry flavor. But that's just my opinion."
5,"I love the taste of this Pumpkin Spice by Green Mountain- it is just right- not overpowering.  Delicious! If someone asked me what flavored coffee to recommend- I would definitely suggest this one- especially this time of year!"
5,"Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for me this is the best non-flavored decaf that I have tried, and I have been drinking it for years.<br /><br />This has a really nice coffee aroma that reminds me of a diner, and a nice medium bold taste, not bitter at all.<br /><br />Shop for price. There are lots of different coffee discount sites on the internet, and depending on your order size, shipping is free. I just ordered this coffee today from one of those sites and paid $10.99 for 24 cups, no tax and no shipping."
5,"This is the cookie I always wanted: oreo flavor without that weird ""creme"" filling, crispy on the outside, moist and slightly chewy on the inside. Perfect.<br /><br />They're so decadent, even my cookieholic self is sated with only two.<br /><br />I bought my bag at a store, so maybe I got a fresher batch than some of the other reviewers. I found nothing to complain about here texturally. This is not ""pretty good for gluten-free"", this is fan-freakin-tastic.  Finding these delights has made my life just a little bit better. Seriously."
5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:22 Mins<br /><br /></span>I selected this item thinking I would try it out on my parents dogs, but when my husband saw it on the counter, he wanted to try it with Kitty. Ha! She hates everything; there is no way she is going to like this stuff. I was wrong. To my total and utter shock, my cat actually liked it. So, here's the video to prove it."
5,"After years of coping with IBS symptoms, I've used the tea and peppermint capsules with AMAZING success. I will be reordering the capsules"
5,"It was my first time buying this one and from the first taste I fell in love with it. Expensive for sure but very worth it in the end. Healthy ingredients and best of all no High Fructose Corn Syrup. Highly recommend it. This is pure Chocolate."
5,"I'm more of a tea drinker than coffee. I am sick and needed some hot tea so my wife bought these English Breakfast Tea K-Cups for me while she was at the store. I had only used the Keurig for coffee so I was a bit skeptical. This tea is amazing. I am going to keep it stocked in my pantry from now on."
5,"I could not medicate my dogs without these. The vendor has always been prompt and includes a sample of their other products at times. So, now my dogs are hooked on Dentees too!"
5,"For years, Sunday breakfast in our house has been waffles or pancakes.  We have had these particular waffles every week since I discovered the Maple Grove Farms Belgian Waffle Mix two months ago.  The malt flavor is a tasty alternative to other mixes and scratch recipes.  The waffles are crispy outside and soft in the middle.  I'm sure we'll return to pancakes for a bit when the blueberries are ripe, but for now, we're happily stuck on these waffles."
5,"I bought this hot sauce from world market because I like to add a little kick to my lunch. When I tried the hot sauce I was pleasantly suprised especially considering it's arounf 4.50.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Very economical<br />2. sweet taste offsets the habanero.<br />3. Add's some nice color contrast when used as garnish.<br />4. Don't need alot to get the flavor you want.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Make sure you shake the bottle before applying the sauce. The flavor sometimes goes to the bottom.<br />2. If you find hab's hot the person won't like it.  (Taste preference)<br /><br />Overall, it's a hit in my book.. I personally dont' find it VERY hot but it's tasty!  enjoy....."
5,"Used in a Lello. Mixes smoothly. Freezes well & holds to a cone. Tastes better than commercial. Takes about 30 min. to make."
5,"When the world didn't know who Tim Burton was, it must have been quite a shock to realise his genius first. This larger than life, colorful, yet dark, very funny, bizarre tale broke into the cinemas, and changed the face of storytelling as we knew it forever. Tim Burton was born, and a whole new dimension of dreams, imagination broke free. Movie was never the same again. And thank Tim Burton for that! You cannot do anything but enjoy this crazy story about a ghost, about the importance of life and love, friendship, and all this covered in an unbelievable cloak."
5,"This is the ultimate in flavored coffee. Excellent body. Enjoy it while you can. But purchase at a Dunkin Donuts if at all possible since buying elsewhere is artificially high."
5,"Kid loves this stuff. Excellent alternative after 1yr. My families kids grew up on this. It's a little sweet but I guess it's ok."
5,"I give them an A. My wife, who is a chocoholic,  gives them a B. Unlike some low cal products, this is like the real thing. It has the taste and texture of a regular, full calorie Brownie. They are especially good when heated."
5,"This item was exactly as I pictured it would be! I can't wait to eat them in front of my friends at school and make them all jealous. Bahaha! I just wish I woulve ordered them sooner so I could make them all jealous longer."
5,"There's nothing better than having a pitcher of Lipton Iced Tea in the fridge. It's so much better (and cheaper) than soda. We've been using it for years, and never once grown tired of it. Add to that the convenience of having it delivered at a price that actually beats my closest supermarket. What's not to love?"
5,"We picked up a couple of the packets (grain-free) at a local store and our cat is incredibly fussy. He will only eat one brand and a few types within that brand. On a whim, I saw the Soulistic cat food and decided to try two packets. The one with the pumpkin soup he gobbled up (amazing). The other one in the pink packet, he is working on. This company has an informative website that tells about the food and their commitment to nutrition. They have an enviro-conscious ethic which I like. There is plenty of moisture in the packets, which our cat loves and this is also good for their urinary tracts, as many cats don't drink enough water or get moisture through their diets. Cats need wet foods! I'm happy our cat will eat a high-quality wet food and plan to try other varieties."
5,"I am quite pleased with the aroma and flavor of this tea.  Hopefully it will help with the ""fat burning"" as said on Dr. Oz.  If not I still enjoy the tea so I would definitely buy again."
5,"These bars got me to become more healthy. Realizing all the nasty junk I eat daily, these helped me get more protien and fiber in my diet. These are like fudgey yummy chocolate bars that taste anything but healthy. I love the white chocolate ones as well."
5,"I have both a very large black German Shepherd male and a sweet Husky female who are both doing very well and enjoying this dog food. We tried Newman's, which worked for awhile (at the time, it was a big relief for a tedious journey), but this seems to be doing the trick: no more itchy dry skin for Bud and it agrees with Molly's food sensitivities as well. I can definitely recommend this dog food!"
5,"I have been looking for this item since last winter. My store stopped carrying it (and I shop at four different grocery stores)I'm so glad I found it here. This is so very rich and smooth, I like the flavor but wish it came in a dark chocolate flavor. And I really agree about the coffee, it makes it so much better. Most cocoa mixes are like drinking colored water, this is so good and you don't need milk to get the thick and rich balance. LOOOOOVE IT !!!"
5,"My little girl loves this product.  She has these snacks on the go and at home.  They have a mild cheese flavor and are not too hard for her gums.  Love the ease of taking these on car rides too!"
5,"If you are a coffee snob, you will not like this cappuccino.  However, for those of us easing into the world of coffee, this is a nice and sweet caffeinated beverage with only 80 calories.  It tastes just like the cappuccinos you get out of the machine at a gas station.  A nice treat!"
5,"I use this porcini salt in many savory dishes - cooked entrees and salads. Delicious. You don't have to use a lot for it to make a big difference. Just a small sprinkle will do the job. It seems expensive for such a little jar but the impact from just a small sprinkle is worth the cost."
5,"I tried it at the Southern Womens show in Orlando, Fl. I usually am not a big fan of coffee. But, this stuff is amazing. and an amazing deal!!"
5,"All I can say it works great.  I use in my smoothies and it does have a berry taste add in other fruits to give it a nice blend.  However it will help you ""LET THE DOGS OUT!!"" since I been using this product it helps in all areas.  I do it twice a day and its great as a meal replacement."
5,"We have really enjoyed these unusual snacks! We first got the variety mix and they were all pretty good but this mix is off the chart! No need to put these in a resealable bag they just don't get that far! I keep thinking how good they would be added to a meal as garnish or a salad. We truly love them! Thanks Guys!"
5,"This coffee has spoiled me for all the other flavors. I need good, STRONG coffee, and this tastes fabulous!"
5,"Ingredients listed: Pure cane sugar, and 100% pure powdered Japanese green tea.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: all 0%, except Sodium (15mg) and Sugar (12g)<br /><br />Basic Instructions: add one packet to 8oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve...<br /><br />My Opinion: It is too sweet for my taste, even diluted in a 16.9oz water bottle. It almost tastes like sugar water. I think the unsweetened version would be better. 5 star because it delivers what it promises.<br /><br />This is Japanese green tea. NOT Chinese green tea. There is a difference."
5,"This has become my favorite hot tea from Teavana. It satisfies my chocolate craving without overpowering the tea. Great for a cool evening or morning."
5,"I have tried many many seaweed snacks.  This by far is totally addictive.  The hint of saltiness with the touch of brown sugar is a treat for your taste buds.  Will order this product again. Yum."
5,"This bar tastes great and the ingredients are simple: almonds, coconut and honey.  As pure as you can get.  Gives me good energy for my morning workout."
5,"I like this grocery.<br /><br />It is too spicy and famous noodle in Korea.<br /><br />I'm not Korean but I can eat it.<br /><br />Customer service is so good because it is so speedy."
5,"Lucky Country Licorice, Black, is the most like old fashioned black licorice that we've found.  We were very disappointed to find it was no longer available in the Costco stores where we shop."
5,"If you are a macadamia nut lover, these are exquisite.  Mauna Loa are simply the best because of the rich volcanic soil in which these nuts are grown. I know of no other brand of macadamia nuts that even approaches the freshness, caliber and flavor of Mauna Loa. This flavor is king on the Hawaiian Islands but is very difficult to locate in stores in the continental U.S. due to shelf space, slotting fees charged by retailers and supermarkets to stock the item and demand. Hershey Chocolate Co. has recently purchased Mauna Loa, and since this acquisition, these nuts have enjoyed a much wider distribution on the U.S. East coast. Amazon's price is competitive and the nuts are simply delicious.  Be sure to refrigerate them immediately after opening to retain their mellow, buttery aroma."
5,"I really liked this cereal. I am gluten-free and haven't had regular cereal in years. The cornflakes are a little bland without putting any kind of sugar or honey on them. But, once you do, they are really good."
5,"Okay, the title's a little crude, but aren't we all a little oral?  For some reason harder and harder to find in the stores, I buy these by the carton and find myself ""sharing"" with friends.  Great for the breath, low in calories, an upper for the taste buds.  I think they're as good as the original that come in the tube and are full of sugar, and I'm so happy Amazon carries them!"
5,"I just had a baby, she is so sweet and beautiful; so she deserve to have what she is like. I couldn't find the same enfamil any where, I found different other forms, same brand but in powder from, but she refused to drink it. I was so desperate. Then I looked in Amazon and I found it in a very good price. Guess what? It has been delivered to me within two days only. I and my baby are both happy since then.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YDJSBC"">Enfamil Newborn Nursette Ready To Use, 2-Ounce, 6-Count Bottles</a>"
5,"The DaVinci syrups are really good in coffee.  We use it every morning and even take it with us when we travel!"
5,"I grew up on Li Hing... put it on gummy candy, fruit, everything.  Moved to midwest for work and can't find it anywhere.  TY Seller!<br />Not exactly like what I was used to in Hawaii... but close enough.  Don't notice enough difference to say anything negative :)"
5,"You can't go wrong with ""Kind Bars"". I've tried just about all the flavors and my hubby and I love them! They have some good antioxidants, taste great, have great crunch without breaking your teeth like some other bars we've tried. I can't imagine anyone not loving these bars."
5,"I highly recommend these Maxwell House big cups! I only have to make 1 of these compared to 2 of the 8 oz cups I usually make and then I'm out the door. Just make sure you have a large enough coffee mug otherwise, your mug will be overflowing with this coffee yummyness!"
5,"I find this brand to have a pleasantly robust flavor without being too strong or bitter. Being decaf, it doesn't get me wired, but it does provide a nice wake-up in the morning and a nice break in the afternoon.<br /><br />A little while after I started the subscription to this coffee they switched from shipping it in four boxes of 24 to two boxes of 50, which makes storage a little more problematic. As a result, I've saved several of the old 24 count boxes to move the K-cup packs into.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this product."
5,"YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY! Doesnt matter if you're allergen-free or not, the Cravings Place mixes make the most DELICIOUS foods you'll ever have. AND they're the EASIEST to make - much easier than the ""regular"" stuff, AND they DONT require to make ANY SUBSTITUTIONS.  What other mixes or recipes are you going to find ANYWHERE that only require oil & water, and wha-lah, you have pancakes, muffins, cookies, brownies... etc etc etc that are delicious & everyone will love.  A few of the mixes require some kind of shortening - we use the organic palm shortening, but there are a number of types you could use that would work.<br /><br />I have not had a single ""failure"" or even a ""mediocre"" result with these - and that's saying something when you consider I've had YEARS of experience ruining food, even before I went allergen-free.  My elementary-school child has become a master baker because of these mixes.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer mentioned, many other products marketed as ""dairy-free"" or ""egg-free"" or whatever, REQUIRE you to add those very things when mixing it up - and the substitutions they offer never come out the same. The Cravings Place mixes are DESIGNED not to need those things, so they come out EXACTLY the way they were meant to - EVERY TIME.<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it, you WONT be sorry!"
5,"My 60-lb golden/lab mix loves these bones -- but only the chicken flavor. She wouldn't touch the liver or ""original."" She's the first dog I've ever had that likes these really hard bones. She's done a good job of chewing down both ends over a period of a year or so, and I've already got a replacement for when the little knobs are completely gone. For now, they are nice and rough and probably scour a lot of tartar off when she gnaws on them."
5,"My husband enjoys puffed rice cereal...We bought this thinking it would be to much but we are ready for another case...The product and the company were both great...."
5,"Bought a Keurig for times when a single cup of coffee is all that is needed.  What I had not anticipated was that my husband was underwhelmed with the assortment of coffees that came with the brewer... until I found the Double Black Diamond Extra Bold. Now my Keurig is being used for afternoon coffee breaks and I don't feel like my ""investment"" is headed to a yard sale/thrift shop anytime soon.  If you are a lover of stronger, premium coffee, this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one."
5,"Best coffee we can buy at a reasonable price.  Must be that chicory!  Must be those southern beans!<br />No matter how we brew it, it comes out great!"
5,"holistic select is extremely healthy for your dog. it is extremely healthy and recommended by vets.<br /><br />my dog is strong and healthy because of the food he eats"
5,"This oil makes the best popcorn even better, like the popcorn you get at the theater or ballpark."
5,"I got to sample some of these at a food show and they were pretty good. The original flavor and texture kind of reminded me of Munchos. The barbecue is good too, very sweet, like KC Masterpiece. And the sour cream and chives is pretty good as well. If I was looking for a quick ""salty"" fix, I would definitely go with the original. They are very light and airy, different!"
5,"Love this coffee...I first found it at my local grocery store, so was thrilled when it showed up on Amazon's subscribe & save program.  It is now one of my husband's favorite coffees, and since it has so much less plastic, the flavor comes through so much better."
5,"My husband is just crazy about these chips!  This is a great deal and they are so delicious!  They are also quite healthy as far as potato chips are concerned.  Enjoy!"
5,"This is excellent coffee and apparently the family of the late reggae star Bob Marley have something to do with it's production and/or marketing. It is a stronger blend coffee and someone with more acute taste buds than mine might argue, but I thought it tasted identical to Starbucks House Blend. This is a fair trade coffee so you are helping out the locals here more than the corporations. These are pods so you might want to have a machine that brews pods before you order, unlike me."
5,"I love this stuff. Does it taste like cheese? It depends who you ask. My mom says yes, I say no, not at all. It has a vaguely cheesy flavor, but this wouldn't fool anybody. There definitely are vegan cheeses that taste like cheese (Daiya brand is decent, and Vegusto, to everyone I've prepared it for, is indistinguishable from real cheese) but they are often expensive and have lots of fat and calories. Chreese, on the other hand, is very cheap and has very little fat or calories. Also it contains fiber, protein, and vitamin b-12, which I think is just great. Actually, I'm writing this review while eating a grilled chreese on pumpernickel. And it's delicious. I've had both the gluten and gluten-free varieties, and they're both great - they taste the same.<br /><br />In closing, no, this is not identical to cheese. But it is really, really tasty, affordable, and nutritious."
5,"Mmmmmmmmmm.... This is all I can say. This is a great snack. It is better tasting than wheat pretzels I hear from everybody including I myself say so, too! Crunchy, tasty, and great!"
5,"These are great olives. They make the best martini.<br />I use gin and about 1/2 teaspoon of the vermouth from the olive jar itself.<br />Pour over ice and stir, please no shaking.<br />Pour out of the strainer into a glass with three of these beautiful olives on a martini pick.<br /><br />Don't pay $15 for a jar though, that's three times the going price.<br />I get them at Stop and Shop for $5 and change."
5,"I have to admit, I was a sceptical at first.  I had picked up some citrus sour fruits to try, as well as an assortment of other things I'd read about that are supposed to be affected by this little miraculous fruit tablet.  After allowing the tab to dissolve on my tongue I immediately tried some lemon and lo and behold it tasted like a super sweet candy.  Grapefruit tasted sugared, limes were like a lighter version of the lemons.  Lemon and lime combo tasted like a sweet Sprite(tm). I had read that Guiness was supposed to taste like chocolate shake but alas this was false.  No chocolate flavor at all, the berries just removed some of the bitterness.  Tobasco(tm) was pretty tasty though. In summation, these tablets are awesome when it comes to citrus, not so much with everything else, but that's just my opinion.."
5,"If you need the convenience of this kind of pouch packaging (lightweight, not breakable glass) for ""on the go"" situations, the Amazon price for these is the best anywhere.  Less than $1 per 3.5 oz pouch.  At the time I'm writing this review, the per ounce price is less than Plum Organics, Ella's Kitchen and Sprouts.  I also prefer this packaging over Sprouts because you don't need a spoon to feed baby, just squeeze directly in the mouth.<br /><br />However, if I'm feeding at home, the best bargain is with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER1D5U"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Pears, (6 months & up), 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.  Even if you don't do Subscribe and Save, it's a great deal, compared to the pouch style competitors."
5,"Pumpkin Spice coffee tastes great for a specialty coffee. Good flavor and not overwhelming. Can be enjoyed anytime, especially in the morning."
5,"This is my favorite thing to feed my 11 year old aussie for a chew.  Her canines have become pretty worn, partially because she developed a habit of chewing her way out of chain link kennels about 5 years ago (which I no longer keep her in) but also because I used to give her very hard chews when she was younger.  I still give her a chew in the evening but it is always something pretty soft.  I like the Sam's Yamz but they are pretty pricey and then I found these!  I purchased my supply from Amazon which is perhaps I didn't have the same experience as the previous reviewer with them being pretty hard. The pieces in the bag I got were very soft and chewy.  With free shipping these are a great deal and don't wear done my dog's teeth!"
5,"I tasted this in Florida and just had to have it.  I found it on Amazon and have been ordering it every other month.  I love it and it is not to high in calories or carbs."
5,"I love the orange taste and use the product daily.  I no longer have the leg cramps that plagued me and plan on continuing to purchase orange flavored natural calm at Amazon."
5,"Earth's Best formula is organic and contains elements of mothers' natural milk. I feel this is the best formula, absent mother's milk, that anyone can give an infant. My granddaughter had a problem with fussiness and gas on other brands, but after switching her to Earth's Best Sensitivity she has become a happy baby."
5,"This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra ""stuff"" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!"
5,"Love all the Dulce Gustos but not crazy about hot choc. Cappuccino & iced Cap are best! Sipping a hot one while I speak! Love latte, too, but not vanilla latte. Dark Roast is my favorite ""daily."" Thank heavens Amazon offers it and much more affordable prices than anyone else - trust me, I've researched. Best price is on subscription, and so much fun to receive. Great packing and speed - always get before projected date. It's almost affordable! But it's part of my ""champagne taste"" condition! I'll try peach tea - yum - next summer."
5,"Looks nearly black in the middle of the popped kernel, but it isn't burnt at all. Corn-ey taste, we're really glad we've found this seller and popcorn."
5,"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
5,"I got this to stave of Alzheimer's (which I hope I do not have). In any case, it is really yummy- I made cookies with it, and the flavor is wonderful!  I will be buying more! It is solid at normal room temperature but gets a bit oily when the temperature rises (we live in Florida)."
5,"If you're watching your carbs and miss egg noodles, Carba Nada is a good replacement. It isn't greatly low carb, but quite a bit less than regular pasta, so you need to watch serving sizes, but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well. The different flavours add more variety, and its also easy to toss with some butter, parmesan, and seasonings. Add leftover chicken or beef, and some vegetables, and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs."
5,"These almonds are fantastic!  I can't find them locally, so I'm glad Amazon sells them (comes to under [...] bucks a bottle).  The only thing better?  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSV556"">Blue Diamond Natural Oven Roasted Almonds Vanilla Bean, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>"
5,"What's not to like????  I pop this little Kcup in my Keurig out comes a delicious cup of Columbian coffee. It's not too strong our mild, just the right balance. No bitterness just deliciousness!!!!!<br />Plus, I can feel good about where it came from because it is fair trade.  Green Mountain not only helps support the farmers, but the community and environment as well. It's a win for all of us.<br />I received a free sample of this via Buzz Agent and so happy I got to try this one out."
5,"UPDATE (1/30/2012):<br /><br />While traveling, I discovered a couple of Indian shops and went in to check out their wares. I wanted to see if they had other styles of masala dabbas. They both had only one type, similar to this one offered here, but smaller, which I liked and the price seemed just right ($12). However, the quality was very poor. They were made from thin metal that I'm not even sure was real stainless steel because it had some rough black spots here and there so I didn't buy.<br /><br />I appreciate this one offered here a lot more now. I wasn't very happy about the price (I paid almost $27), which seemed a bit steep, but the quality is far superior to what I found in those shops.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />A dear friend saw my masala dabba and fell in love with it. I don't know where mine was purchased because it was given to me as a present so I came here hoping to find one for my friend. I like this one even better than mine because of the see-through glass lid.<br /><br />Very nice quality, an easy-to-open yet snug lid (you won't break a nail trying to open it), and the seven containers have straight sides and smooth edges. It came with one smooth stainless steel spoon.<br /><br />I gave this to my friend for her birthday and she really appreciated it.<br /><br />Now that I know how nice these are, I will order two more for myself, one to store the savory spices I use daily and the other one for spices I use in baking (my current one holds spices for Indian dishes, which stay quite fresh even though I only use them once or twice a month).<br /><br />Incidentally, if this is your first masala dabba remember this: Store it where it will always stay horizontal and never tilt it because you'll end up with instant garam masala! Yep, speaking from experience. :)<br /><br />Very nice spice box, highly recommended."
5,"I am hooked on this water.. clean and pure fantastic!<br />at 25.00 and FREE shipping it worth not dealing with driving, standing in lines and<br />hauling it around."
5,"My cocker puppy 4 mos threw up castor and poullex and Natural balance and had loose motions. SO i tried this and he did great ! even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops. which is great."
5,"I was thrilled to find this flavor available at amazon.  I had not seen it in the grocery stores for a while so I called Quaker and was told they would no longer be packaging the Banana Bread flavor alone.  It would only be available as part of a variety pack.  This, of course, is the only flavor my husband likes, so I'll buy it from amazon until it's all gone. :-)"
5,"I never try other before, someone recommended. I use it on my sons goody bags for his party theme (baseball ) they came on time and not melted( it was crazy hot that day) good Flavor grown ups to enjoy it!"
5,"our dog, biggie, loves these things.  and never seems to get tired of em.  these are the treats that make him do all his tricks with gusto cuz he wants them so bad!  i dunno if the glucosamine/chondroitin really helps their joints but we're hoping it does."
5,"I first read and heard about the benefits of Goji berries, while vacationing on the island of Mallorca two years ago.  I immediately went to the local market and found them being sold in pre-packaged bags and also loose.  I have been taking one teaspoon of Goji berries softened in a little water every day ever since and have not had one single cold in two years.<br />I guess everything that is written about its amazing benefits is true.  An amazing product, which my family and many of my friends have been taking with the same positive effect.  However, I was told that the goji berries imported from Nepal are much better than the ones from China.  Not sure why, but I have taken both."
5,"I have read a lot of mixed reviews and was hesitant to purchase this item. I have now ordered 2 cases over the course of 4 months and both were high quality delicious coconut milk. It does seperate (which is normal) so just give the can a good shake before you open it. No dented cans either, but who cares if your can is dented anyway? Relax people, a dent does not effect the quality of the contents of the can."
5,"Why I love this tea:<br /><br />- It's organic and fair trade.<br />- It contains simple, wholesome ingredients -- just black tea and essential oil of lemon.<br />- It's sugar-free.<br />- The taste is pure and delicious.<br />- It comes in large tea bags designed for making whole pitchers of iced tea -- so convenient!<br /><br />I drink iced tea every day, and this one's definitely a winner. It has become a staple in my pantry. I also love Rishi's raspberry iced tea: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052W6YDS"">Rishi Tea Raspberry Iced Tea, 1.75-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a>."
5,"This is my go to tea, and it's a great tasting white tea.  I usually get the organic version, but ordered this one and it's also tasty.  Such a good deal for 100 tea bags.  Unflavored white tea is hard to find, and this one is great."
5,"Perfect tasting water! I have a reverse osmosis system under my kitchen sink, so I know how good, clean water should taste and this Essentia definitely tastes pure. I can say that I did feel better hydrated first thing in the morning drinking this instead of my water.<br /><br />It tastes MUCH better than the majority of bottled waters out there that are little more than tap water. This is a thousand times better tasting than tap water. Essentia has no smell and no aftertaste. I will be using this before my morning workouts from now on."
5,"I have a 115 pound German Shepherd and obviously he has very strong jaws.  Chew toys typically do not last long in my house. He loves this ring and it has lasted for about a month now.  Of course it is only about a fourth of the size now but that should certainly be expected with such a large dog.  I am thrilled with the durability and just ordered another one today."
5,"The package arrived this morning before I walked out the door, that is fast shipping! Tried the mixed vegetable curry with cottage cheese for dinner this evening, 2 thumbs up, tastes great. Looking forward to the rest of them.<br />Bon appetite"
5,"I wasn't sure if I needed to buy specific butter flavored popcorn salt or if I could just use regular salt.  I am thrilled that I bought this and it makes a huge difference.  The oil is very important, but the salt is critical as well for great tasting popcorn!"
5,"I can relate to EVERYONE here that commented on this product except the bugs in box person.  Sorry to hear that! I got the shipment two days ahead of expected delivery estimates.  My entire family [From my GrandMother on down to my own children] grew up on this and it is the best instant hot cereal on planet Earth!  I think this cereal is either being discontinued or going to another part of the country.  Either way I hope and pray that does not happen.  I live in the north Bronx area of NYC and I had to order this from Amazon.com because I couldn't find it in Pathmark, Target, Big K, Walmart, Sam's, Super Stop N Shop, Met's Food,Keyfood, The Finefare two blocks down from me, The Hispanic  stores [everywhere] don't carry it, BJ's and Costco do not have it either.  I was looking for this like a crackhead speedwalking with a couch on his/her back in the winter would after selling a $10 DVD player for a fix. I was like Maypo, Maypo, I gotta get my Maypo! I had a family relative go back down to the south Bronx and get two boxes from a store there that still carries it. Also I found one Stop N Shop in New Jersey that carries it. [That's why I chose Amazon!] Even though it is cheaper to get it from That store.  I will keep Amazon in mind if it should vanish completely.  Again, Amazon RULES!!! Oh and I do not work for Amazon.com or the makers of MAYPO either for all the haters out there. I just love this stuff :)"
5,"It was so hard to find these items anywhere, so when I found the crab apple jelly AND jam on Amazon, I got really excited.  I try to find ""unique"" Christmas gifts for my hard to please brother in law.  Well, crab apple jelly is one of his favorite things, and JAM is better appreciated from any fruit than jelly.  So I bought him both, as well as some Maine blueberry jam.  I think he'll be happy this year."
5,"I experienced a noticeable difference in endurance and recovery.  The taste is far better than I had anticipated."
5,"Mine came with a wine soaked variety thats purple - i haven't tried yet , the cheddar is delicious and melts smoothly ...Marigold (actually has marigold bits in it) - very nutty, earthy soooo tasty my favorite so far and the bouche de chevre -mmm runny creamy delicious! I have never been disappointed by any of the igourmet cheese selections even if its different than pictured this is no different!"
5,"Excellent Boldo tea. I have had Boldo tea many times in South America., and always wanted to get in the States. It was very difficult to obtain. This one surpasses what I had before, in flavor and body."
5,"Usually, I consume protein bars during my work day, but I had to search for something to replace those bars during the hotter months in my part of California because protein bars melt quite quickly if not stored in a cooler with ice packs. I was on the search for something that would not weigh me down during the work day, taste good, and portable. I tried several other flavors before I found two that agreed with my taste buds - almond & coconut and nut delight."
5,"My dog loves Booda Bones.  They are a bit pricy so I only give him a couple a week as a special treat.  I'll continue buying them from Amazon for the best price."
5,"Rich, dark chocolate thinly covering a tart orange marmalade-like substance on a soft sponge cookie. It melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. Chocolate and orange are an addictive combination.  There are other brands out there of these sponge cookies, but the Bahlsen brand is by far tops in the quality of the ingredients used."
5,"When Americans want to add some heat to food, we usually think of Mexican or Louisiana style hot sauces.  Sriracha, on the other hand, is a common sauce in Thailand and is named after the largest harbor in that country.  This version, made in California, is a wonderful diversion from Tabasco-like sauces.  Although made with peppers and relatively hot, the sauce has a generous helping of garlic taste that really perks up food.  It's ideal for Asian recipes, but it can be used with any food to which you want to add some heat, including soups, pasta, and chicken wings (the company also has a website that includes some excellent recipes).  The sauce comes in a handy plastic squeeze bottle that is ideal for squirting just the right amount into your food.  If you're tired of the usual old hot sauce, give Sriracha a try."
5,"This gelatin is really good; the strawberry-banana flavor is nice but not too overpowering. I love the fact that it has no sodium and only 10 calories. It is so worth the small amount of time it takes to prepare it for the amount of money saved over other products with excess packaging!"
5,"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."
5,"I use this to make iced lattes and they turn out well; I don't have a coffee shop nearby.  I put a double portion of dry coffee in a cup with a few teaspoons of cold water and it dissolves quickly.  Then add ice and milk and you have what we affectionately refer to as a ""hillbilly latte.""  They are quite good, cheap, and very quick."
5,"One thing I missed in Chili when going low carb was the beans. While I would prefer Pinto Beans in my chili the black soy beans are a darn good alternative and at only one net gram of carb per serving you can't beat them. In addition, Amazon's price beats other sources.<br /><br />I highly recommend both the beans and Amazon."
5,"You mean you didn't know about HappyTot Organic Superfoods for Tots?  Well, I can see how that's possible since it has taken *forever* for this company to keep these pouches in stock anywhere!  We ALWAYS have these ""fruit squeezies"" (as our two-year old calls them) on hand in our pantry and in the diaper bag for a quick, wholesome snack.  They're portable and easy.  We just pop off the cap and he eats straight out of the pouch.  I also love that they've added the supergrain so that the kiddo gets a dose of omega-3s.  If you compare the nutritional information on the back of the product with other organic fruit-pouch brands, you'll see that HappyTot pouches and the other HappyBaby brand pouches actually have nutritional value in them.  Some of the others (I'm looking at you, Revolution Mashups) hardly have any nutritional value at all--not even vitamin C in some flavors.  I gotta say that my son loves all of the HappyTot fruit-veggie combos, though my palate not so much.  Doesn't matter; as long as he likes them and he's getting something more nutritious than the plethora of junk food on grocery store shelves, I'm a HappyMom!"
5,"This was a great buy! I saved a lot of money purchasing it on Amazon, rather than purchasing it through Whole Foods. A more bitter and acquired taste, but I am lovin' it!"
5,"These are great, way better than a Snickers and healthier. Great to carry one with me when I am out for the day. This way I have something safe to eat and has some chocolate! :)"
5,"Since putting our dog on the Wellness dog food, we don't have any more diarrhea or upset tummy issues."
5,"This is the second time I purchased this Fancy Feast Chunky Turkey Feast for my finicky cats.  This product/flavor is no longer carried in the markets here, so I'm glad to have found it on Amazon.  I will continue to purchase it as well!"
5,"I am very picky about the tea I drink my favorite being Ahmad English #1. After trying this tea, to my surprise and delight I may have found another favorite!<br /><br />This tea is very smooth with low acidity and it goes a long way. This is a loose tea and it brews up wonderfully in the Bodum double wall infuser cup. You can make several cups of tea with just a heaping teaspoon of this loose tea and each cup tastes great without being weak.<br /><br />The lemony bergomot is a lovely subtle addition that tastes and smells wonderful. The tea has a beautiful dark amber color and a full rounded flavor without the acidic bite some tea can have.<br /><br />At first the price seemed a bit high but after using it and seeing how little you actually need to use I would recommend this highly as a great value and consider it for gift giving. Then again once you try it you may not want to give it away. Very enjoyable tea!"
5,"The Gloria Jeans K cups were a huge success for my live-in guest during the Thanksgiving Holiday!  Ready when they were.  The price was the best around!  Thanks!"
5,"After much research on amazon and other websites, I chose to buy this organic coconut oil to use primarily on my skin.  I love it more with each use, my skin is noticeably and increasingly softer and more supple after a few weeks of use, but even after the first use my skin felt and looked very healthy.  I have used it as a replacement for lotion, both on my body and my face.  I only need about two tablespoons to cover my entire body.  I believe it has even improved the skin on my face, which can be sensitive to synthetic lotions and break out.  The oil has a pleasant fresh coconut smell and taste, which fades after rubbing it in, so don't worry about smelling strongly of coconut (not like tanning lotion).<br /><br />As other reviewers have said: coconut oil is solid (hard vegetable shortning-like texture) at room temperature, but turns softer and eventually to liquid at 76 degrees fahrenheit.  So, it melts quickly on your skin of course.<br /><br />I also used some of the oil in a homemade hot cocoa recipe, it had a pleasant taste and didn't seem ""oily"".<br /><br />Hope this review helps!  I highly recommend this product. Great price for what you get, too."
5,"i am putting together some pampering type gift baskets and ordered several jars of lavender.  the labels make these look like top $<br />boutique lavender.  They look great and the lavender looks like top grade, haven't opened them as they are gifts."
5,"I have never been disappointed with a Cafe Excellence Product.  This has a nutty vanilla flavor with no oily aftertaste like so many flavored coffees have."
5,"My husband uses hazelnut extract to flavor his coffee.He uses one teaspoon for a whole pot. I also use it in baking.I also use other extract for baking thank you so much for you products  Joan"
5,"We loved this snack.  I was surprised by how large the bags were.  I guess I was expecting single serve size, but the bags were large enough for my whole family.  It was crunchy and cheesey."
5,"We love these little cookies!  They have great spicy/cinnamon flavor!  Best price with subscribe and save!  I can only buy these at Whole Foods and they are .99/package there!"
5,"jack links sweet and hot jerky is THE GERATEST jerky ever! I'v had a lot of different brands and flavors but nothing compares to the taste and qualty of this jerky. I wish Walmart still carried the larger bags of it"
5,"Great taste, great snack. Very fresh, tastes good, has a light cocoa dusting of dark chocolate on them. Not messy.  Great for keeping at your desk at work and munching on through out the day.  I really liked the flavor and freshness of this item.  I highly recommend."
5,"My mother always used Libby's products.  They were easy to find on the West Coast where I grew up. When I moved to the East Coast I Amazon.  You have always been able to find a product for me."
5,"Would NEVER know this is Sugar-Free -- being diabetic, this is a real treat for me and being able to be able to make something quickly that is also delicious -- is a total plus.<br /><br />Jell-O Instant is a PERFECT snack and Pistachio is my favorite flavor of all time. Yum-o!<br /><br />Watch for ""sales"" sometimes this is WAY cheaper than others here. By like $9! You gotta love a sale ;) Especially in these hard times!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon. Without your services (I am a shut-in) I don't know what I would do for MANY of the things that I am able to order from you. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your service and Subscribe and Save is AWESOME! Please stop taking so many things OFF that plan :("
5,"I love this coffee! I wouldn't be caught dead drinking anything else!! It is always so fresh and perfect! I hate starbucks coffee... it tastes like dirt to me... I love strong coffee, but not dirt... so this is that perfect blend of strong and WONDERFUL flavor!!! And I love buying it off Amazon because i get the best price i have found anywhere!! :) LOVE IT!!!! 2 thumbs up in my book!!"
5,"I ordered the 54 pod drawer with the 36 pod, flat drawer. They fit perfectly together and leave space for creamer and sugar. So much better than basket or the constant refilling of the swiveling pod station."
5,"I have used Artemis food for over a 6 month period and couldn't be happier.  It has been the best food for both of my pups (one being a Shih Tzu who has a sensitive stomach).  Other premium foods kept irritating her large intestines which caused me numerous vet bills.  I have had dogs for the last 25 years and have always researched and bought premium dog food; however, Artemis Fresh Mix Small Breed Adult Formula is by far the best.  It may costs a little more, but has saved me dollars in vet bills.  I would recommend spending the few extra dollars for peace of mind in knowing you are feeding your loved ones a quality food without all the fillers that are in other foods."
5,"Ordered this as a donation to the Cat House on the Kings in Parlier, CA...also known as The Lady with 700 Cats on Nat Geo Wild's recent programs.  A no-kill, no-cage non-profit sanctuary for cats and dogs, each animal is treated like a beloved family pet while awaiting a potential adoption."
5,"I had been searching for Oolong tea and couldn't find it in my area. They even included a gift.  I will definitely order again:)  Thanks for having this product available!"
5,"Gevalia Signature Crema is hands-down one of two most requested coffees in my home. It is THE most popular coffee for my Tassimo coffee maker, and it is now the only one I buy on a regular basis. Other specialty coffees are fun once in a while, but never seem to quite satisfy like this one. It's strong without being overwhelming--with an aroma and  flavor that linger. There's a certain richness to this coffee--it looks great in a glass cup, and the little layer of ""crema"" on top makes me forget about having dessert! My other favorite house coffee is for the Keurig machine, and is in a diferent review."
5,"When these come by mail, my dog knows the package is for him, and he tears it apart getting it open.  We typically order four or five different treats at the same time and this is the one he opens first! He absolutely loves these and it seems like anything from Pet 'n Shape is on the healthy side."
5,"Very nice figs, moist, clean.  Since they're spotty in the local stores, I bought the five pound bag and put them in the freezer, since they keep that way just fine."
5,"These are very good, although not sour, but when the ship goes out to sea the ship store sells out of these fast by the sailors. They are a huge item with sailors and make great care packages. :)<br /><br />Added: The bags came as 8.75 ozs NOT 9oz as stated."
5,"Its an awesome product, coffee tastes delicious!!!!<br />I didnt expected it to be as good as Nespresso capsules but they are!!! I totally recommend this product."
5,"This is my daughter's favorite K-cup product. Mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having Wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen."
5,"I've been receiving this product via auto-delivery for about a year now.  I try to eat one of these bars as my lunch at least 3 days a week.  It tastes like a candy bar and provides enough fiber, protein, etc. to replace a meal.  I think it's a great way to help me lose weight."
5,"Finally some great coffee, thank goodness Starbucks finally gave in.  More varieties please.  Wish they would come in larger quantaties."
5,"We have been using Royal Canin for the past few years for both our dogs and not only is a great product but the dogs love it. Amazon makes it easy to order and it arrives in just a couple of days"
5,"My cat is crazy about this cat food!  He has not been accepting of three others I have tried to give him.  He has a sensitive stomach but this food causes no problems for him.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find it as it was discontinued at two small stores that couldn't maintain an inventory of it for some reason. Grain-free cat food is hard to find and I'm so grateful to have a source now through Amazon. Little rescued Sonny thanks you too!"
5,"this is the best coffee. I've tried many k cup coffees and this one is the best one that i have found so far."
5,"These shortbread cookies are the most delicious I've ever tasted- I treat myself to no more than one a day- they are truly addictive- and the ginger IS GOOD FOR YOU !!"
5,"I have a 6 month old Pomeranian, and he just LOVES these. They are also very handy, since he can only have small treats, and I don't have to break these up!"
5,"Bought this as a gift for my wife, and she absolutely, totally loved it.  She couldn't stop eating it.  Seriously - she had to keep going back for little nibbles.  She loved it straight.  She loved it on crackers.  She just totally loves it...<br /><br />It's a really nice big piece of fish too...  This is going to be a staple for her birthdays from now on."
5,"A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any ""good for you"" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!<br /><br />These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like ""Astronaut Ice Cream"") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.<br /><br />Each pack contains -<br /><br />Fuji Apple:<br />About 1 1/2 Apples per pack<br />39 Calories<br />7 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!<br /><br />Highly Recommended! We bought <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027IACXI"">Brothers ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana - 20 Count Bags</a> and like all three types!<br /><br />Note: These are made in China<br /><br />CFH"
5,"If you love the white grapefruit Haribo candy as much as I do you wont be sorry when you purchase the Fruit Salad. The flavors are complex and realistic, you wont get horrible twizzler-esq fake strawberries with this company. If you are trying to sabotage someone's diet just send em two five pound bags of Haribo and they cannot resist. Seriously, this bag is a no-brainer, you will not regret your purchase."
5,"I have never heard nor bought this brand before, but couldn't pass up the subscribe and save pricing for these k cups. They were delicious, and as previous poster stated, you don't even need to add anything to it!!!"
5,"Switched totally to Himalayan Salt several years ago because of its' health qualities.<br />Have paid lots more in retail stores.  For the price this product is a great value.<br />The salt also shakes out easily from my salt container.  Have never had any clumping occur.<br />Will continue to purchase in the future."
5,"I knew nothing about the quality of this product when I placed my order, and I was happy to find that the nuts were all fresh and delicious with a perfect ratio of nut to chocolate.  Very tasty.  Excellent quality.  Fast shipping.  Highly recommended."
5,"I shared this with family members and we all enjoyed the taste and price. Good luck finding anywhere cheaper or more convenient. Thanks Amazon!"
5,"anything from Oreo you can't say enough good things about. If you like vanilla and you like chocolate as well putting them together in one bite is ingenious."
5,"I was not sure this product would live up to the ads, but it gave me the energy boost I needed when I needed it when I had to work the overnight shift."
5,"These were surprisingly delicious. Excellent texture, like a hearty tortilla chip, yet very crisp. The perfect chip for a hearty dip, and perfect by itself--just enough salt. I don't even like olives, but I loved the flavor of this chip."
5,"The Tug-a-Jug has become our Hobbes' favorite toy.  We no longer give him meals in a bowl, but either in this toy or in a Buster Cube. We prefer this to the Buster Cube when we are watching TV because it is less noisy. The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole. This way we haven't had to buy a new one and he still enjoys it every night."
5,"Alright, I'll preface by saying that I have not had the pricing or expiration (not that I would notice) issues that some of the other reviewers have faced.  The humanity.  I get them every 3 months and the price has always been between 6.50 and 8.50.  This is a tremendous bargain.  One of these boxes at Duane Reade costs $4.99+.  I would probably get it delivered more than once every 3 months if I ate breakfast more.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite cereal, and while I may sound like a child, I'm 27.  Since you're curious, the other members of the Cereal Rushmore are:<br />Cinnamon Toast Crunch<br />Frosted Flakes<br />Corn Pops<br />Honorable Mention: Lucky Charms<br /><br />Boom, done.<br /><br />Update 9/20/12: Now that they got rid of the 3pack, and replaced it with the 4pack, they also jacked the price.  S+S is $18 currently ($4.25 per box).  While I will still buy them, the savings is noticeably less.  Maybe the other reviewers were right all along."
5,"I love this product. Product was received in a timely manner in excellent condition. I would order this product again."
5,"The tea taste is very good, I've taken it yesterday for the first time. I'm taking it because of my pregnancy, many friends told me about its precious toning for the uterus."
5,"I wasn't expecting much but I thought I would give this a try since coffee has been giving me problems. Very close to coffee taste. Was looking for something without caffeine and acid to go with morning muffins etc and this will do the job. will be buying this again and trying other teecino flavors. Absolutely amazed!!!!"
5,"Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish.  Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life.  Dried mushrooms pack a lot of flavor and have a long shelf life (I believe they are good for up to 2 years).  A one ounce package of dried is the equivalent of a half pound of fresh.  They need to be soaked in warm water for about an hour to hydrate before using.  The water used for hydrating can be used in your dish for added flavor.  It can also be reduced to concentrate the flavor.  Once hydrated, the mushrooms can be used in any application that you would use fresh or canned.<br /><br />The Porcinis have a more bold earthy taste.  They go very well in soup, stews and pasta sauce (be sure to add the hydrating water to the pasta sauce, yummy!).<br /><br />The FungusAmongUs is a high quality brand that I highly recommend."
5,"I love popcorn at the local movieplexes (extra butter, please.)  When I get below the ""butter layer,"" I'm always a little sad, but am usually pretty engaged in the movie, and don't care as much.  If you know what I'm talking about, then I can cut to the chase.  Barring health concerns (I've no idea how bad this is calorie-wise or fats-wise, really), THIS is the stuff you want!!<br /><br />I wanted to imitate the movie theater experience at home, so I bought a popcorn popper on a whim at a discount web retailer. At a friend's behest, I bought a jar of orange-ish coconut oil (turns yellow as it spreads out, and looks really cool on a metal spoon). That gave me the movie theater SMELL, and an important component of the overall flavor.<br /><br />One of the reviewers here recommends coconut oil, this stuff, and Flavacol, and for folks that want butter flavor without the oil, Flavacol is fantastic, but it really didn't get me to the movie theater experience on its own.  I'm keeping the box I bought, anyway, in case someone doesn't want this ""butter"" stuff.  I have no idea how unhealthy it really is.<br /><br />This topping really made all of the difference in the world, in terms of getting the movieplex experience.  I bought a separate squirter from Amazon (you can probably find it in the list of things people also bought when they bought this.)  It fit perfectly and really simplified the ""butter"" application.  You could probably put this on microwave popcorn and get really close to the theater experience.<br /><br />This topping is not really butter, obviously.  Folks who buy it thinking otherwise will hopefully learn to read titles and labels more closely.<br /><br />I love this stuff. Can't recommend it enough."
5,"Love this coffee!! Lives up to it's name. Great for Monday mornings :-). There isn't a caffeine drop either - nice smooth ""landing"".  I'm glad I can buy it in bulk."
5,"I was rather skeptical about the taste claims but I'm really impressed.  I have now placed 3 more orders.  I cannot eat regular popcorn because of the husks, this is better than the real deal, with no husk to worry about.  The butter flavored and sea salt are my favorites."
5,"I get to have my cake and eat it too with this. I make my espresso, cool it, add crushed ice, whipping cream, this syrup and tada! It is great. Practically no carbs so it is great for my diet and keeps me happy, snappy and thin."
5,"These single serve aseptic cartons of milk, which need no refrigeration, are just incredibly convenient to have on hand. Many trips to the store have been avoided -- saving a lot of gas and time -- when I only needed a cup or two of milk.<br /><br />A plus is that the milk is delicious, organic, and comes in lowfat 1%. Instant milk, though handy to use in recipes, never seems to mix up into a pleasantly drinkable beverage.<br /><br />My idea of coffee is 8 oz. of hot milk to 2 oz. of strong coffee, so I've used these out of my pantry multiple times at 6 a.m. when I really didn't want to go to the store just to get milk for my wake-up coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps you never run out of milk like I do, but if you do, and find yourself needing just enough for cereal, or a recipe, or for your coffee or tea, these are great to have tucked away and available. A terrific time saver!"
5,"I cannot stop eating these wonderful chips!  Even my children like them.  I am currently a WW member and each bag is only 3 points so I get to eat the whole bag without any guilt.  Love, love, love them!"
5,"I have to say that I have brewed for Coopers Kits at this point and this is most likely the best... Not necessarily because this product is more superior then the others kits but I added a few more ""things"" as I become a more experienced brewer. First, you can not produce a true Wheat Beer buy utilizing Coopers standard ale yeast... Therefore, I went with a liquid Wyeast stain. Also, I boiled the 1.5 liters of water as per the coopers instructions but I added a 1/2 oz of Bitter orange peal and 1 tsp of Corriander. This really gave the beer a nice Orange zest which is a true Southern Germany/Munich style wheat beer. However, I do believe simply making the kit as is will produce good beer just like the other kits."
5,"Definately worth the money.  7 reusable pods and 21 grow sponges. 54 small nutrient tablets and 48 large nutrient tablets which can grow plants for a year.  Compare this to the extended nutrient tablets packs for $15 for 3 months or consider that the $20 herb kits are designed to last 3 months and you can clearly see the value of these kits.  The fact that you can choose seeds you want to grow and not be stuck with a couple of unwanted pods is great."
5,"I read here on Amazon and other sites that these were good so I decided to go ahead and buy the whole case. My wife laughed when she saw how many boxes there were,  but I know that I will eat them all because they are really good.<br /><br />Go ahead, you will be happy with this purchase - and they are organic."
5,"Everyone's tastes are different and I didn't expect to like this after reading some of the reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised and glad I tried it. I prefer this French Vanilla over a couple of the other brands.  It's the only one I don't have to add sugar or creamer to and it's not too heavy on the vanilla for my taste.  I'm ordering enough to keep stocked up since it's my evening treat and a great price!"
5,"I use these for my cat.  You get more bang for your buck if you buy the larger dog treats and just break them into smaller pieces.  She gest them while we eat dinner, if she stratches on her post, or does something very cute.  I love these treats because I don't feel guilty giving them to her."
5,"This is my favorite flavor of tea.  I enjoy white tea more than the darker teas, and the mix of peppermint and ginger is perfect.  If you enjoy any kind of peppermint tea or coffee (such as those served around Christmas) you will enjoy this tea.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the little white packet shown in the picture) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets.  If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />The only negative I've seen is that a few of the tea bags have ""failed.""  By ""failed,"" I mean that when I combine them with hot water they sometimes expand quickly and purge a small amount of tea leaves through the stapled end of the bag.  It's a minor distraction (only once or twice have I had to through it out), but it's probably a 4% failure rate based on my usage so far.  No doubt part of the problem stems from poor technique on my part, but I haven't had this problem with other teas."
5,"I'm not a traditional tea drinker; in fact don't care for tea at all. However, because I love anise flavor, I thought I'd try this tea. It has a great, naturally-sweet flavor. I now look forward to my daily cup of licorice-spice tea!"
5,"These chips are delicious. Salty sweet with a hint of spice. I have no idea how Tamari is supposed to taste, but these chips are awesome. I just finished an entire bag in one day!"
5,"Great formula,it is also cheaper than the same one if you buy it in the store."
5,"These bars are a great alternative to granola bars for those who can't eat gluten. Not as filling and a little sweeter but delicious."
5,"This is the best bread I have made so far hands down!!! I have tried making some from scratch from cookbooks and I have also tried Pamelas... but for some reason it never came out right.This bread is the closest to homemade regular bread that you can make and it is soooo easy.I will be making this our familys favorite!"
5,"These are great! I send the kiddos off to preschool with one every day. They love them and consider them a treat, and I love the fact that they're getting some veggies at lunch. They're very picky eaters who normally don't eat veggies unless I'm right on top of them, urging them along. You can get these at the grocery store, but they're about a buck fifty a pop at my local market. Shop wisely on Amazon and compare prices--you should be able to get them for under a dollar. Still a bit steep for some mashed up food, but I think it's worth it to keep a steady stream of veggies in picky kids' tummies."
5,"I received a great offer from Amazon to purchase 50 K-Cups at a reasonable cost.  I purchased the item and found it to be fabulous.  I have recently been laid off from work so I am at home looking for a job so I seem to be drinking my coffee.  This was a great deal for me and the cost savings was wonderful.  Thank You Amazon"
5,"i love, love, love the coffee. not too strong, but perfect for a cup of joe. very affordable brand and worth every penny."
5,"I supplement this with some Blue Buffalo occasionally up to 50%, but this is my dogs main food for the most part and he is a thriving and happy wheaten. Did a fair amount of research and this seems to be a safe and reliably sourced food. I supplement more from a human desire to change things up for him rather than any real need. The bag also has a ziploc closer which is kind of handy."
5,"We discovered this delicious product when we lived in SC in 1960. We have always searched for it when we were in the South. I saw it listed on Amazon and odered a 5-lb box. It is quite fresh and just as delicious as we remembered. Thank you!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K73F28"">Claxton Fruitcake Five Pound Regular (White) Recipe</a>"
5,"Dont mind buying from AMAZON but surprised that AMAZON is the only carrier of this product!!! anyway great cereal good price super service<br />thanks"
5,"Lavazza is the best. I've used just about every one of their varieties, and it's consistently smooth and rich, a coffee lover's dream.<br />I use any one of the espresso blends in my drip maker, because I can't get the body & smoothness I want any other way.<br /><br />I recommend it with gusto."
5,"our dog GOBBLES this food up! It looks really fresh and healthy, with actual dried pieces of REAL food. FANTASTIC!"
5,"Found this product discounted at a good price at slickdeals.net for about $10.<br /><br />First time drinking this stuff since I bought it.  I was blown away at how awesome it taste.  This was my first time trying something other than the Nestle brand cocoa (other than the few times I ordered cocoa at a cafe).<br /><br />Has a nice blend of mocoa/cocoa and doesn't taste too sweet like what I'm used to with Nestle.<br /><br />Definitely giving this a thumbs up."
5,"I love Sweet Chili Riceworks chips.  I first tried them at Costco, then could not find them again.  I emailed the company and found Walmart was to get some in.  I purchased 6 bags, but once again found they no longer carry them.  I finally found them once again at Amazon after contacting the company.  But I will not be buying from Amazon again.  The chips are nothing but crumbs in the bags and I ordered 12.  They came all crushed, very few whole chips.  I am greatly disapointed.  I love the chips, but would like a local place to purchase."
5,"This is simply the best toffee in the world.  I don't know what else to say.  One could also try Walker's treacle toffee, also the best of its kind."
5,"these cookies are a favorite of mine.  crisp, with just the right amount of ginger.  I don't know what the other comment is talkin about not havin enough ginger, my mouth gets very tingly when I eat them, and I think I like a lot of spice."
5,"I cut all processed foods from my diet and started to make my own marsala and curry dishes. Wow, garam masala is amazing! It's like a hidden ingredient in some many foods I've eaten and I can't believe my food taste on par with a restaurant. My boyfriend is a little weird and adds this to his coffee b/c of the cloves, cinnamon and cardamom. This will last me a while since I got three and most recipes call for a teaspoon or less. Great value!"
5,"I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try."
5,"My tiny rat terrier does just fine with these and is able to chew them rather quickly.  She loves them more than any treat we give her."
5,"We have been feeding our three dogs Eagle Pack Holistic for almost eight years.  I've never once had a reason to question the integrity of the company or the health benefits from feeding it to my dogs.  Eagle Pack has never recalled any of their foods (even when it seemed like almost every other brand was).  They have a great proof of purchase rewards program.  You can sign up on their website to receive monthly coupons.  My dogs have amazing coats, amazing teeth, and amazing energy.  I don't think that there is a better food that could be recommended."
5,"Bella says these hearts are delectable, even though the bakers have included an ""arrow"" through the center of this heart treat for easily breaking in half."
5,"I buy this for a relative who really enjoys it. Bridgeford Summer Sausage is the only summer sausage that she likes."
5,"These chips are wonderfully light and lightly seansoned and that allows one to use them in a variety of creative ways.<br />I have had gastric bypass and still have difficulty getting my daily protien intake because it is difficult to eat the protien they suggest.  However, with these chips and this flavor in particular I can travel with them and add them to just about any soup for a sustainable meal with crunch and nutrional value.<br />Unlike the more pronounced flavors of nacho cheese ( superb choice for football games etc.) I can enjoy these as a part of a meal even in salads.<br />Bravo Kays' for making such a wonderful product.<br />WHERE ARE THE CINNAMON ONES?  THEY MAKE A GREAT QUICK BREAKFAST!!!!!!!!!<br />M"
5,"Impossible to find in grocery stores in my area, so I was pleased to find it on-line.  Received very quickly, and making wonderful desserts"
5,"I used this 2 times now and the flavor is great. As for being overpriced, I found these products at Food4Less for $3.99 each."
5,"I have bought a box these protein bars several times.  They make a great midday snack, or to take with you on a hike.  Excellent taste.  I was very happy to see them available once again on Amazon."
5,"My dogs love these treats. I love the fact that you can break them in half to give double the amount. I love all of the Zukes treats and my dogs do too!"
5,"My local newspaper did a gourmet test on balsamic vinegars.  Of all the vinegars they tested, this one came out best. Here was their trick, they simmered the bottle of vinegar in a sauce pan and reduced the liquid in half. The result is a rich syrup with incredible, concentrated flavor."
5,"When I first tried these I wasnt too sure, I thought they were going to be another nasty trail mix. WRONG. This mix is sooooooo good. So good Im buying them off amazon because no stores in DC has them."
5,"Zagnut candy bar is a favorite of mine from early years and very had to find in stores or candy machines.  Imagine my delight when I found it on line.  I will never tire of my Zagnuts and now can keep them on hand all the time."
5,"This is  wonderful  to add to a meal, as a side dish. Very flavorful. Can be used in wraps as a snack or lunch item. Easy to prepare."
5,"My dogs love these. They each get one a day. Amazon's prices are great! Thanks..."
5,"I am a health nut and love this product....Great ingredients..spreads easily..it's a complete protein and used along with Julian complete protein bread it makes a perfect meal on the run or anytime...I have tried the peanut free and really like that as well!!!!"
5,"I LOVE the Blue Diamond Butter Toffee and The Chocolate.  This is my first try with the Cinnamon and they are fabulous!  I eat and live low carb and eat a lot of nuts...the flavored Blue Diamond Almonds are hard to find, so I am happy to find them on Amazon.  Even better to have them delivered to my door FAST & FREE!  Thanks Amazon and Blue Diamond!"
5,"Just read the title, seriously. I am a tea junkie and love my Chai. After purchasing many from the local supermarkets and whole foods. I was sold on Stash brand for the powerfully good aroma and flavor they seem to provide in their teas. If you like very watery tea you may not like this Chai as much as I do. For me, one tea bag makes a quart of good tea!"
5,"You know how sometimes you remember something from your childhood and when you try it again as an adult it just doesn't quite live up to your memory?  Well...these DO! These were my all time favorite pop-tarts as a kid and I think the only flavor I ate.  When they started frosting them I stopped eating them because I just hate the frosting.  I don't think I've had one in 20 to 30 years.  Anyway, they taste EXACTLY the way I remember them.  I can't believe I had to buy a case to get them, but I'm sending some to my siblings and actually have some friends who are buying a few off of me.  Mine arrived well packaged and undamaged and the expiration date is about 9 months away.  If you loved these as a kid...go for it!"
5,"This is a terrific product!  I like it better than regular matzoh and for someone on a gluten free diet it's often hard to find good baked goods.  This matzoh makes a great cracker!  Even if I weren't on a gluten free diet I'd want to eat it!  The only drawback is it's impossible to find and Amazon is currently not carrying it!  Perhaps with enough great reviews it will be added!"
5,"Nylabones last forever and a day and all four of our dogs, big and small, love them."
5,"Our Schnoodle, Bella, is a very picky eater. Finally found something she likes which makes me happy because I try to buy Newman products whenever I can. I am impressed that their profits go to charity! This canned food is also healthy & good for her!"
5,"You're seriously missing out.<br /><br />These crushed tomatoes by Tuttorosso are in a class by themselves. Does for Red Sauce<br />and spaghetti sauces what Beluga Caviar and Dom Perignon does for a promising date!<br /><br />Any combination of this, Contadina tomato paste, and Hunts tomato sauce will yield a<br />spectacular sauce of a unique red color, and now you can flavor it the way you want,<br />but don't be shy with the fresh basil.<br /><br />Available at most local retailers I've found, and cheap at under $3. The best!<br /><br />BTW, I read the complaints posted here... OK, all I can say is that I have been using<br />Tuttorosso products for 10 years and never had a problem, this stuff is pretty consistent<br />in its quality."
5,"Just the right amount of oil, just the right amount of salt. When it comes to convenience, you will simply NOT be able to beat this Pack!"
5,"I love the chamomile tea. Its sweet and mild. Its excellent for a bed time tea."
5,"There's nothing bad to say. I love it on bread, toast, bagels, and fruit bread.  I grew up on this in England."
5,"Recently purchased- sprinkled over my ice cream tonight and went to heaven. If not so expense, I would purchase more"
5,"I haven't tried this particular trap yet but the design is excellent.  I have a couple of the wooden gopher traps that this is a copy of and I've caught the gopher every time.  I think one of the reasons this design works so well is the trigger mechanism is far enough into the trap that by the time the gopher pushes enough dirt into the trap to trigger it, the gopher is well into the trap and gets caught."
5,"My dog loves this toy. I have a 60lb Shepard mix and she will spend hours with this thing. She is the type of dog to scarf down her food in a second flat if it's in a bowl, so I give her breakfast and dinner in this thing and it can take upwards of 2 hours for her to get it all out. I notice that she doesn't act as hungry or bored during the rest of the day which is great! I also have a kong toy that I would fill with treats but that was way too easy for her. The bottle is made out of hard plastic and so far she has hardly made a dent in it. Beyond a collar and leash this is by far one of the best investments I have ever made for my pup. I would recommend this for my friends!<br /><br />Emily"
5,"Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there... No grain, all meat, blah blah.  Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.  They chomp a piece in half, and eat both halves..."
5,"Love, love the Natucket Blend in the morning, afternoon, actually anytime.  Just wish it came in larger packs, as I feel like I need to limit.  I'm not a big coffee drinker, but enjoy it when it is not too strong.  Will order again from Amazon - fast and easy!!!!!"
5,"I could not find this flavor in the local stores anymore, so I was pleased to find it at Amazon. Its a tangy tomato dressing, a little sweet, with the taste of bacon mixed in. It doesn't have the peppery taste of the other Catalina dressing. Mmm Mmm Good!"
5,"The ability to subscribe and save is amazing, because in all honesty who doesn't love cheez-its, especially reduced fat they're so much crisper"
5,"Got the Munch Nut Bar from my granddaughter, loved it and couldn't find it anywhere. So I googled it and found it on Amazon.com.  Best candy bar I have eaten, it has a buttery taste, with nuts and corn syrup.  I have been ordering them every since I found them on Amazon."
5,"I smelled this package from the mailbox outside of my house.  When I first got my package, it was completely destroyed in the shipping.  I immediately contacted customer service, they responded to me the SAME day (which is almost unheard of now a days), and they sent me a new package within the next couple of days.  These people are so friendly, so nice, very understanding, and truly have a great attitude for business and their customers. I flavored powdered sugar with it to make Lavender Frosting (sifting the sugar of course, the buds are very potent).  It's so aromatic, a little bit of lavender truly goes a LONG way! I have about 2 cups of lavender from purchasing the 4oz package.  I highly recommend any product from the OliveNation company, they have great products and I'll be getting more!  You get a coupon when you purchase anything, it's wonderful to put towards your next purchase!"
5,"If you like chocolate (like I do), then you will like this stuff; its the real thing. The hot chocolate drink tastes like what I imagine the Aztecs would have made, with great taste and a 'warm all over' feeling when it goes down. What a treat!"
5,"I'm very happy I found this brand of Key LIme curd and can hardly wait to make a pie with it.  I'm planning on baking an almond crust and top the curd with meringue made with brown sugar.  The combination is fabulous and this curd will make it that much better."
5,"Yes it is a little ""earthy"" (not like dirt as another review) but I like it.  It's very refreshing, and works wells to take off excess water weight.  I do not know if it helps burn fat, but that's not why I drink it.  I drink it because it tastes good."
5,"None of the stores sell this flavor.  Thank goodness I found it on Amazon!!"
5,"Osem's Israeli couscous is some of the finest pasta I have ever had.<br /><br />The taste and texture that these little balls of yumminess produce is just amazing. There are some many different ways to prepare it and so many dishes and side-dishes you can make with it. I just can't say enough good things about this pasta.<br /><br />If you take a little bit of extra time to toast these babies before you cook them up, talk about a completely different level of taste.<br /><br />From entr&eacute;es, to side-dishes, I have yet to find a way I couldn't prepare this couscous. Italian style, with chop suey (as a replacement for rice), even mexican style. This is probably one of the most versatile foods on the planet.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed."
5,"check out my pics. This is a great little bley themed basket.

5,"I didn't know what to expect when I received this bottle of water from amazon. Our tap water tastes terrible, so we always drink the generic store-bought bottled water which is a cut above tap.<br /><br />Well, ESSENTIA bottled water is gorgeous.  To me it tastes like what fresh water from a spring would probably taste like.  It is so fresh tasting with absolutely no after-taste.  I don't know how they do it!  The label reads purified water with electolytes, so obviously this is not spring water, but it is a superior bottled water that I would highly recommend.  I'll definitely get this again.  A clean, fresh, wonderful tasting water."
5,"Pros:<br />Tastes like my regular filtered water with no aftertaste.<br />With added electrolytes, 9.5pH, no added sugar or colorings.<br />Large 1.5l size, BPA and Phthalate free bottle.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None found yet.<br /><br />Great drink for those who want high pH, electrolytes and no sugar or artificial sugar."
5,"It's hard to find the 20 pack boxes locally.<br />This is convenient and cheaper than the<br />small packs. When I can find the big boxes,<br />the price is about the same."
5,"My pup loves this food and I love that it's organic and not bulked up with useless, unhealthy fillers. However, unless you're using the 'Subscribe & Save' feature, you're better off buying this at Walmart for $2.18 per can."
5,"I have cut back significantly on my gluten and sugar intake, but still want something good to munch on-these chips fit the bill and have become my everyday go-to snack .  They're wonderful!"
5,"WOW,  This is nothing like any liquid smoke I can find in my home town.  It looks more like a thin BBQ sauce but has a fantastic hickory smoke aroma.  I will never use another liquid smoke.  Stubb's also makes a great BBQ sauce."
5,"I purchased these for my dog and my sisters 2.  They are all large dogs (46 lbs. and up)  Until these they were running around, getting in each others face - JUST DOING WHAT DOGS DO.  I gave them the ""EVERLASTING TREAT'  and they went to seperate places and did not move for over an hour.<br /><br />There is only one thing - with these dogs - NOTHING IS EVERLASTING.  They loved them and I will definitely buy more.<br /><br />As usual - You can go wrong - when you go AMAZON"
5,"Good, quality dog food. I did a lot of searching before choosing this food, for my corgi puppy, as corgis are prone to obesity problems if not watched carefully and fed properly. Everywhere I looked recommended Blue Buffalo. She loves the food, and after slowly switching her from the food the breeder gave her to this one, I've had several people comment on how beautiful and soft her coat is. Recommend."
5,"After many years of eating Quaker Oats, I purchased McCann's and haven't looked back. I didn't know such a modest dish could taste so incredibly good. On Sunday nights I use the short cut method (on the side of the can)which requires one minute of cooking and then storage in the fridge until the following morning. I cook a medium pot which lasts us all week. Just heat them up for about 10 minutes on low (or microwave on medium high) and you have the best oatmeal on the planet. I frequently charge it up with dried cranberries, fresh frozen blueberries, strawberries, chunks of apple and cinnamon and even chopped nuts, sunflower seeds and ground flax seeds. This oatmeal is not mushy but neither is it hard. The texture is chewy and the flavor is awesome. My husband and I are hooked and keep our cupboard well stocked with this healthy breakfast food. We even eat it as a light snack at night with a bit of maple syrup when we crave something sweet. For anyone who loves oatmeal, this is the one to try."
5,"I like my sanka early in the morning,and late at night with a cookie before i go to bed at 2 a.m."
5,"I have tried many green teas, in many price ranges.  This one is my favorite, I drink about 4 cups per day.  Mostly iced, but great hot too.<br /><br />The packaging, which doesn't look fancy, keeps the tea very fresh. Box says only 12 mg caffeine per cup.  If anyone knows if that is true, I would love to hear from you.<br /><br />Great tea, at a great price.  No need to buy loose leaf, I save money and like this better."
5,"I love this this curry, I make a peanut curry cabbage salad, which has been a hit everywhere I take it."
5,"This has become one of my favorite teas - it is a delicious, smooth blend that requires no sugar. My husband even likes it. We've also found it to be an exceptional immune system booster. We've tried many different brands of echinacea capsules many times over the years, but this tea seems to be especially potent and quick-acting - maybe because it's a blend of 3 species of echinacea, and also includes astragalus & elderberry. It's a very enjoyable way to do something good for your body!"
5,"This particular brand and blend of Green Mountain coffee is one of the best I have ever tasted or enjoyed.  Its got a nice body, is NOT bitter, and goes down very smoothly.  Would recommend to any coffee drinkers for their morning fix to get moving."
5,"The stores around here don't sell Cinnamon Tea.  I agree with my husband that this is a really good tea!"
5,"VERY good, arrived fast. Of all the kettle style chips I've had, the thickness of these really pushes the crunch factor. Great flavor, not too greasy. Thanks Amazon and Kettle!"
5,"This is my daughter's absolute favorite breakfast food!  She is 3 years old, but has been enjoying it since about a year & half.  She also likes the Maple & Brown Sugar variety, but definitely prefers this one.  I use organic milk to prepare it, just enough to soak the oats, put it in the microwave for about 45 seconds then top it with applesauce as the mix in (to cool it off quicker).  She loves it!"
5,"to me any of the mcdougall products are an awesome score.<br /><br />i have tried almost all of their soups. since those where tasty i thought i would give the oatmeal a try.<br /><br />it was perfect. i cooked it per instructions and enjoyed. i really like that is it organic, has more than just oats in it and is portable. i will buy again"
5,"These granola bars are the only peanut-free granola bar I've been able to find for my peanut allergic son. They are very filling and tasty - the whole family loves them."
5,"In case you con not picture it, 144 bubbles are a lot of bubbles.  We had a wedding with 150 people and it was more than enough.  They are about 3 inches tall by 1 inch wide.  They are cute, did not spill before the reception, and the guests enjoyed them."
5,"Yogi tea hit it right with this combination--nice and minty with light undertones of herbs such as cardamon, cinnamon and clove, among others. It is slightly sweet, probably owing to the addition of Stevia Leaf. Besides mint, the basis of this blend is black tea, but it tastes much better than black tea to me.  I am not a black tea or energy drink consumer, so the 77 mg of caffeine is a bit high for me, but I do not feel jittery drinking this tea. This ""ReVitalize"" tea gives me a refreshing boost, and it seems like a good start to the morning."
5,"The chips are great, with a family of seven the only shelf life I worry about is keeping them there.  Really though, did you see the price?  Like $1.12 a bag. Whole foods may finnally have someone to hold them accountable destroying health food stores.  Thanks Amazon, for carring the brands whole foods wont bother with any more and for having prices that you can feed families with."
5,"This is primo cat weed. Cats that can generally take or leave catnip can't resist the stuff."
5,"Probably the best beef jerky I've ever had!  The country cut is just so moist and flavorful.  If you like beef jerky it is a must try for anyone!"
5,"I use a ton of ""greenies"" or other dental products for my little dog (a 7 lb Yorkie/Maltese mix.)  She used to hate it when I left the house, so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only.  However, she was started to get a little chunky, so thought switching her to the ""light"" version  might be a better option.  I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system, but I've seen no problem thus far, and I've been using them for over a week.  She doesn't seem to notice a difference at all, and I feel comfortable knowing I'm not overfeeding her (in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place!) I would definitely recommend this product."
5,"Do yourself a favor and buy several of these when you order, they go fast.  My only complaint is that they're small, so one is just enough to make you really want another, so I can never drink just one I always end up drinking at least two before my self-control kicks in.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Ginger Beer, and it's always hard to find it here in the US, most of the ones you find are kind of watered down and have no bite.  This brand is the exception - awesome!"
5,"I am addicted to this water!  I think that the pomegranate-tangerine and blackberry are the tastiest flavors.  I love that it offers a ""hint"" of flavor without being sweet, since most flavored waters are sweet and full of calories.  I've been buying this via 'subscribe & save' for months now and still love it!<br /><br />The biggest downside to drinking Hint water is that it's tough to go back to drinking plain water :)"
5,"I ordered the 1st Fruit starter kit as soon as I received the okay from the pediatrician.  The fruit contains pears apples and bananas.  My 6 month old loves the pears!!  The apples are okay for her and we haven't tried the bananas.  Her little mouth just flies open - it is hilarious!<br /><br />This is a good price for the package.  It is convenient because it comes packages on a box. Much better than putting all of the little jars in your buggy at the store - especially since I hardly have time to get to the store anyway.<br /><br />One negative is that sometimes my grocery store has buy 1 get 1 free - so the Amazon price is high compared to that."
5,"Finally, a gluten free chip that tastes great! It is light and flavorful. I will certainly be ordering more soon!"
5,"Never heard of this before ordering it. It has since become a favorite for my wife and I. Great flavor."
5,"I love this brand of k-cup! Just the right blend for me... not too strong, not too light... just right. Amazon gives you the best value when buying k-cups :)"
5,"Excellent product. Easy to use and the flavor is great. I will purchase this product again from Amazon and I recommend it to anyone who has a Keurig brewer."
5,"Going on a regular basis to Holland, I got to know the Philips Senseo coffee machine well. I even have one in my condo overthere. Since I knew that the machine was introduced in North America I tried to buy one in Canada. But no such luck, the machine is only available in the USA, too bad. I bought one in the US, including the whole stock of Douwe Egberts dark roast coffee pods in the local U.S. Wall Mart. I thought that I could order more supply over the internet only to find out that shipping is only available in the U.S. Shame on  Philips and Douwe Egberts for not introducing the machine and the coffee in Canada as well.<br /><br />I can really recommend the dark roast coffee pods, the machine works very well, but I would even be more happy if I could go to my own (Canadian) store and buy the stuff instead of asking my mom to bring the coffee from Holland, where they have by the way more coffee varieties such as mocca, French vanilla etc.<br /><br />Henny de Gruijter,<br /><br />Sooke B.C., Canada"
5,"I use Spike on popcorn, veggies, meats, soups, eggs... you name it.  It is a healthier seasoning than most - and so delicious!  I am elated to know that I can now order it online, because the health food store is not always so easy to get to."
5,"This is one of my favorite teas!  It has a very mild, floral flavor and fragrance that is great when I am stressed out, not feeling great, or just want to relax.  I have given tea bags to several of my friends to try and they all have really liked it too."
5,"Like other reviewers, I have a cat who would get sick often. I had her checked for issues, but she is otherwise healthy.<br /><br />So when a my new vet suggested a sensitive stomach food, such as this, I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />The difference is amazing. She still has an occasional hairball (this doesn't fix that issue...I didn't expect it to. And my fluffball has more fur than any other living creature, so I can handle a once-a-month hairball). But her near daily throwing up has stopped."
5,"At first I was reluctant to spend the extra money on the small packets of Ken's Fat Free Italian my daughter requested, as this is one of the salad dressings her college offers in the dining room. I thought I'd be able to find it in a bottle, and save some money.<br /><br />After looking in all the local stores, I visited Ken's website where I discovered that, for some reason, the Fat Free Italian is only available in the packets.<br /><br />I was very happy to find the packets here. Yes, they're a bit pricey, but super convenient, taste almost like the regular Ken's Italian, and have only 20 calories!<br /><br />The individual servings are large enough that I can use 1/2 packet on a side salad and 1 packet is plenty for an entree-sized salad. Delicious!"
5,"I am impressed with the quality of these dog treats.  Amazon seems to sell these treats for the best price and I will continue to order these in the future.  My dog really likes the lamb variety and they smell very good.  I reccommend these to any animal lover!"
5,"I generally buy these candies at big Lots for about a buck a bag. Unfortunately they don't always have them in sugarless nor do they always have the kinds I like. With Prime shipping I can order them for about the same price in bulk without tax (Thus far)making them a better deal. They get here quick and are just what I wanted. Good job guys!!!"
5,"When I bought this coffee I was skeptical that it would live up to it's Amazon rating. After I tried it, it exceeded my expectations. This coffee is excellent. Not bitter at all. I drink my coffee black which usually allows me to taste the coffee fully without diluting it with cream or sweetening it with sugar. This coffee was not too weak and not too strong to the point it was bitter. It will definitely remind you of an Italian cafe."
5,"If you do not eat gluten, and you love peanut butter cookies, you HAVE to try these cookies! They are so superly delicious! They are somewhat crumbly in the box, and at least one cookie in every box will be broken into pieces. But they are so good you will not even care! Definitely try them, you'll love them."
5,"5-hour energy drink works within minutes.  It gives me that extra boost I sometimes need to get started in the morning and it lasts a long time.5 Hour Energy, Berry Flavor, 2 Oz, Box/12"
5,"Love this gluten free oatmeal! Sometimes I eat it as a snack before bed. Other times when I'm craving sweets I just add a teaspoon of brown sugar or a banana, but normally I eat it w/o anything added just water as the package says - Very Tasty! Ordering by the case through subscribe & save is a steal because this oatmeal is $5.99 in stores if you are able to find it."
5,"While I understand people getting upset over the price increase, the low rate is to reflect the quality of the product not the cost increase by Amazon or their vendors. I actually use the subscribe option  to save money but cancel or put on hold after a few days, I never leave any order to be sent automaticatedly since I will risk the chance of having to pay more, we need to be responsible buyers. Amazon is a business and knows that they will make money on those not paying attention, PEOPLE that is what life had become so get over and on with it. I do prefer the 3 boxes since 4 was to much for us and still buy it when it goes down in price."
5,"Salsa Brava has been the No. 1 taco sauce for as long as I can remember. I'm 76 and from Orange County, CA where we had dozens of super mom & pop Mexican restaurants, each having their own specialty; almost all served Salsa Brava and other La Victoria products.<br />My daughter in Florida tells me none of the supermarkets in her area carry Salsa Brava any more, just the La Victoria ""Green Taco Sauce""<br />I just ordered 12-12oz bottles from Amazon and had her ship them to me in Singapore."
5,"Best strawberry tasting jelly beans ever!  Used maroon/red and orange for a college colors grad party and they tasted great!"
5,"The Rapunzel Organic Dark Chocolate with Almonds Bars are my absolute favorite chocolate.  While not as high in antioxidants as a 70%+ dark chocolate, 55% cocoa is still much richer than a milk chocolate.  Rather than being creamy, the bars have a firm texture.  Being 55% cocoa, they have a strong chocolate taste without being bitter.<br /><br />Just looking at them, the bars seem to be about 1/4 to 1/3 almonds by volume and about 3/4 to 2/3 chocolate by volume.  The almonds are a tad larger than the almond slivers (not the thin slices) that you would buy in the store.  This is much better than having GIANT whole almonds sticking out of the chocolate like some brands.  You are guaranteed to taste almonds in every bite.<br /><br />The absolute best part about these bars is that they do not contain soy, dairy or wheat as ingredients. It is fairly easy to find chocolate without wheat, pretty hard to find chocolate without dairy, and almost impossible to find chocolate without Soy Lechithin in it. To find chocolate with none of those three is extraordinarily rare. And it tastes great!! So the Rapunzel Chocolate practically qualifies as a miracle.<br /><br />I also recommend the Rapunzel 70% Dark Chocolate for a change of flavor."
5,"Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase."
5,"Great product, I use this to bake with cook deserts, in coffee and tea and on frest fruit, i like it as much as i did sugar."
5,"Terriffic new product--easy to fix and so moist there are no crumbs...I bought at local mkt.(Von's)in the PRODUCE dept by the bananas!!Cannot find it now--where is it available near to me--I live near San Diego--will buy a ""bunch""!! thx SH"
5,"I found these at Costco first, and decided to buy them on here because I can get an all Blackberry case which in my opinion is the best(not a huge fan of the Orange..Apple is pretty good).I tried these as an alternative to soda (my vice) and I love them. They are not overly sweet (sugar amount COULD be lower) and I drink them constantly. I would like to think they also don't dehydrate you as much as soda would.<br />Also, if you like these I would suggest trying R.W. Knudsen Spritzer Black Cherry. A little more expensive but taste extremely good."
5,"THIS STUFF IS AMAZING, I LOVE IT. I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GO TO THE STORE AND GET THIS (I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT STOES SELL THIS) ANYWAYS THIS SMELLS GREAT AND TASTS GREAT"
5,"This product arrived well packaged and before the estimated arrival date. The packaging looks unmentionable but it is double sealed at the top and has a zip-lock re-sealable function. I opened the package and immediately smelled the aroma of this high quality tea and noticed the aluminum foil lining. I made a huge cup of this tea using 1 tsp of tea per 1 cup of water. I boiled the water and let it sit for 5 minutes with no heat before immersing the infuser. I let it do it's thing for 15 minutes and then poured one of the best cups of Rooibos I have ever had. I will try with cinnamon and cloves tomorrow, hot then iced. You ar emissing out if you don't get some of this awesome tea!"
5,"I am gluten-free and dairy-free, so there are not a lot of ""on the go"" food choices.  Some, like the Lara bars, are really dense and don't resemble real food.  The Kind bars however taste fresh with a nice mix of flavors.  The Cranberry Almond is my favorite, followed closely by the Almond Apricot.  They are resilient enough to be carried around in my purse for ""food emergencies"".  They get a little flat, but hold up much better than a banana and still taste great.  Good price on Amazon, I pay over $20/box at local stores."
5,"These are such good chips! Most rice chips are bland or have bad texture. These chips are crunchy and so tasty--a nice thick chip that is great for thick dips like hummus or peanut butter. We bring a bag to our local mediterranean place to use for hummus instead of pita bread (gluten allergy). Seriously, these chips are great. I buy them buy the case because our whole family loves to snack on them. Subscribe and save makes us save even more. I love lundberg products generally (try their gluten free cous cous), but their rice chips are my favorite."
5,"This is a very flavorful, full-bodied mustard. It's fantastic on sandwiches and a terrific addition to your favorite recipes calling for mustard. Leave the bright yellow stuff for the kids - do yourself a favor and give this Old No. 7 a try. We've now gone through nearly 3 packs of it and I plan on ordering more as soon as I open the last bottle.<br /><br />Update: It is now 2011. We have now gone through several more boxes of this mustard. It is just as good as ever. I must recommend this mustard. It is so good."
5,"I love these - I have to study a lot and watch my caloric intake because of inactivity and these are the best! I like this flavor the best and due to my many fruit allergies they are the only ones I feel safe eating - no allergic response at all!"
5,"it's candy! it's delicious. these are on sale at amazon from time to time. I always buy them when there's a promo code."
5,"I have used this food for 3 months, and at first I thought it was great. But have since taken all my dogs off of it. Their coats are dry and have bad hair loss. Some dogs it is hard to keep weight on them with this food."
5,"Great product for weight loss help! If you are looking for a chip substitute, you need to try these. They have a great crunch and they are low in calorie."
5,"I have been purchasing these treats at the recommendation of the vet to help with my cat's tarter build ups.  When they are chewed they release enzymes into kitty's mouth to help fight against the tarter.<br /><br />What really surprised me is the price difference, I was paying about $12 at the vet for a 30 pack.  When I did the math on buying the 90 pack + S&H, it's about the same amount I would pay for two 30 packs -- so I got 30 more, another month's supply!<br /><br />Also, Entirely Pets shipped this very promptly.  I ordered on Labor Day Weekend and it arrived on the following Thursday.  Good Service!"
5,"These pistachios were absolutely fresh.  I doubt that I had ever had a really fresh pistachio before. I'll definitely buy again."
5,"I read some reviews and I think they are going about it wrong.  My favorite part of this cereal was not eating it in a bowl with milk, but by making rice krispie treats.  My son has celiac and we used to pay a fortune for gluten free treats that were awful.  I don't know how this holds up as a cereal with milk, but if you make your own rice krispie treats then these are awesome."
5,"New Yorkers will know what a Chocolate Egg Cream is: No Egg, no cream, really an Ice Cream Soda without the ice cream. This is the traditional chocolate syrup to use in a Chocolate Egg Cream. The only way to get the authentic taste. There are cheaper sources on the Web for this product."
5,"I almost didn't buy this flavor after reading a few reviews where people mentioned they could hardly taste the lemon.<br />I tried it and was pleasantly surprised at the delicious lemon flavor! It's now my favorite flavor.<br />I don't know whether the people posting that they can't taste the lemon used enough or if they didn't shake the bottle first or what.<br />It is the best one so far. :)"
5,"I bought this for my wife on our 3rd year Anniversary. She loves every single item in the basket. Not to mention the pink slippers that came with it. Great deal for the few items."
5,"Of all the Friskies Pary Mix flavors. this is the hardest to find in pet or grocery stores. Glad for this site to get this product. Our cats like this flavor the most.<br />Thank you."
5,"Recently I purchased this tea for my sister,an avid tea drinker. When she opened the box she was "" wowed"" by the silk sachet,and, said she felt like she was drinking tea with the queen. She really liked the cinnamon and orange flavors,as well. I would purchase this product again. She's even sending me a sample to share in this tea tasting experience."
5,"there is no after taste like other diet items. this hits the spot. i subscribed to it and still find myself order extra. great for kids. they love them and keeps them away from all the sugar."
5,"Great buy, excellent quality. Love the big size. Keep it right next to the stove. I look forward to ordering again soon."

5,"I wanted to stick with organic formula and tried similac organic but that seemed to give my daughter stomach problems.  She really reacted much better to Earth's Best and it also seemed to be not as thick and foamy as the similac (more like the consistency of breast milk).  This product does go for $35-$45 where I live so doing the ship and save through amazon is by FAR the best price!  I had been getting it shipped for about 4 months now (daughter is 7 months old now) and price has only fluctuated maybe $4-$5 for the pack of 4 containers.  This still at the most breaks down to $23/container- can't beat it!  Easy to mix, occasionally gets little chunks but can be mixed with a quick shake.  Highly recommend for value and quality of the product."
5,"We had never tried red chips before and wasn't sure what we would be getting, we were pleasantly surprised. They have a great flavor and texture."
5,"The On the Go Pouch is just perfect! My food allergic children carry these in their backpacks in case plans change and they don't have access to safe foods.  We also keep a supply in their lockers and classrooms in the event of a school lock down, where each classroom is locked down no one can exit or enter the classroom (sometimes for hours).  They are perfect for school earthquake kits too for states that require a kit for each student.  I can't rave enough for the convenience, taste and ease of mind in case of emergencies!"
5,"I was first introduced to the Red Rice & Beans chips in my hometown of Bethlehem, PA.  When I moved to North Carolina I was unable to find these chips in my local area.  On my trips back home, I would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to NC.  Then I discovered that I could order them on-line and life was great.  These chips are my all time favorite and everyone that I serve them to loves them just the same.  You just gotta try them ... you'll be hooked !!!  ..... Nancy Walsh"
5,"The product was fresh, colorful, AND sugarless. The sender evidently shipped the package immediately...it arrived a quick three days later :-)"

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

5,"I eat couscous as my main carb staple daily and i always use Jyoti sauces like this to prepare it. For one bowl of couscous you will need about 1/3rd can of this to have a hearty filling meal.

5,"These have become my absolute favorite candy, second only to chocolate!  I took a few handfuls to share at work today and all of my coworkers loved them too.<br /><br />The first positive thing I noticed about these after they arrived is that the serving size is * 3 * lollies, not just * 1 * -- not that I'm advocating overconsumption of candy, but if you have kids it's good to know that they can eat 3 of these without even getting close to a hundred calories!<br /><br />The Pomegranate and Berry flavors are traditional ""red"" flavor, only without the disgusting quality that most regular ""red"" lollies have of being made out of sugar and synthetic dyes.  Mouth-watering!<br /><br />The Lemon flavor is VERY lemony -- so much so that it tastes like you're chewing and sucking on a real lemon, lemon peel included.  At times it can be a little overpowering, but if you love real lemon flavor you'll love this.<br /><br />The Orange flavor is a typical orange flavor but pleasantly so.<br /><br />The Watermelon is very similar to the Jolly Rancher ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8GWR2"">Jolly Rancher Hard Candies, Assorted Flavors, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> ) sort of Watermelon, but much, much tastier, with a very clean finish.  It is very much like licking a real slice of watermelon.<br /><br />The package I received also included a mango flavor, much to my surprise!  This, also, is fantastic.<br /><br />Overall I HIGHLY recommend these.  They are well worth the price, the package is HUGE, the quality is excellent, and they're natural and organic to boot!"
5,"Crystal light Mojito flavor brings the sweet and tart flavor of Mojito to a non alcoholic drink mix that will be a great change of pace to the iced teas and fruit punches we usually drink. Each small pouch makes two quarts. The drink is mildly sweet with a fresh mint flavor, which tastes very natural and not artificial. Very tasty and good."
5,"Best chips I've ever eaten but you should sell them in 11 to 15 oz bags."
5,"This was a big shocker.  I got one a piece for my two dogs.  They went absolutely nuts over these things, as if they were getting a hot dog.  I used to buy them all the time until we left the toys behind on a vacation.  The dogs loved the jerky rings but not so much the cornstarch rings.  I would put the cornstarch rings on the outside and the jerky rings on the inside.  Somehow they would eat the jerky completely without touching the cornstarch.<br /><br />Its a good toy and treat to keep them busy and out of trouble.  The treats a fairly cheap as well as the toy.  These might be a bit big for small dogs but I strongly recommend them.  Great treat/toy."
5,"That's all I can say. Yum at a great price! I can't find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome."
5,"I don't understand all the negative reviews...this coffee is great! I had purchased a box of it and hadn't tried it yet; however, after reading the reviews here, I was ready to take it back to the store and exchange it for another flavor. But I thought I should at least give it a try...I'm glad I did! It is a milder coffee but it has a wonderful aroma and flavor! I was pleasantly surprised as I was expecting something disgusting (as per some of the reviews here). I certainly didn't smell SKUNK! It smelled very good as it was brewing...a little carmel-like. I added a little carmel whipped topping and it tastes scrumptious.<br /><br />I hope you will give it a fair trial and don't be biased by the negative reviews. People have different tastes; coffee is such an individual preference. That's why there are ten zillion variety of coffees. But I hope you'll give this one a chance...I bet you'll be glad you did! ;-)"
5,"our labradoole, misfit, loves this treat.  he thinks hes getting just a treat but they're really taking care of his teeth."
5,"These are better than ""regular"" pretzels. They are light and crunchy with a buttery taste. I am so glad to have found these. They restored hope that I can have good food without the ""aftermath"" that typically comes with eating.<br /><br />My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them. She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like ""normal"" pretzels."
5,"Wow!!! This is a great stuff. I had used the product before then had trouble locating it. Now that I have found a place to purchase it, I will be coming back."

5,"I was worried that my cat would not like these and was hesitant to buy this many.  I purchased a smaller bag and my cat LOVES them.<br /><br />So I purchased this much larger bag at Amazon's much better price via Amazon from Entirely Pets.  Again, I was worried about the seller based on other comments.  But they were ordered on Sunday, and I got them Tuesday morning - they ship from Fremont, CA.  The expiration date on the bag is 16 months from now, about what I would get in any retail store.  So I've just not experienced any problems with this seller or this product.<br /><br />The manufacturer admits that brushing your cat's teeth is much better, and I do that about every other day.  This product ensures that there is at least something done for his teeth every day.  And trust me, my cat does not let me forget to give him one of these every night.  He'll claw at my legs until I do and his claws are sharp!<br /><br />By the way, one tip for cat owners: many of an older cat's problems are due to the propensity of most cats not to drink enough water: kidney and teeth problems are common.  I feed my cat only a teaspoon of wet food a day, smothered in about 2 ounces of water.  He drinks the wet-food-flavored water and only then gets to eat the wet food.  My cat is 19 years old (the average cat lives to be about 12-14 years old) and has had no major health problems.  However, the teeth cleanings are getting to be too stressful for him, so I've taken to these treats and brushing his teeth to try to spread out the cleanings."
5,"We enjoyed our package of pomegranate licorice.  I prefer to buy organic and this fits the bill.  It's not too sweet but yet still is candy.  The entire family enjoyed it and it was a nice special treat.  If you are looking for a nice treat that is not too sweet and sugary this works.  I would prefer that they didn't use corn syrup but it is candy."
5,"I can always count on NOW to provide a quality product. I use this in sweetening my homemade yogurt and smoothies. Just a few drops flavors your treat and then you may add fruits and other ingredients to complete your product. In my yogurt, the french vanilla cuts the sharpness and allows the flavor of your fruit to come through. Wonderful! Love the french vanilla. A little bit goes a long way. Nice way to sweeten without sugar or nasty chemicals."
5,"This has a great light flavor and much better for you than artificial sweetners or the genetically modified splenda. I am going through this stuff rather quickly and will be ordering again soon."
5,"Awesome product...It is hard to find things with low sugar, low salt, and low fat with a great taste. This product definately fits the bill!"
5,"What else is there to say? They arrived promptly, perhaps more on time than expected. Expiration date was not like NEXT DAY so they were good to go!"
5,"We used to drink another English tea, Yorkshire, but were not entirely satisfied with the taste.  It was good, but a bit weak for our liking.....especially with an English wife!<br /><br />We then remembered PG Tips, decided to try it, and are now hooked..like the good old days when I resided in the UK!  It's the pyramid shaped bags, as well as appearing to have more tea per bag, that makes the perfect cuppa'!"
5,"McCann's steel cut oatmeal is a delicious and nutritious way to start the day.  My husband and I have eaten McCann's oatmeal as a special treat on every weekend of our wonderful marriage.  While it takes about 20 minutes to cook, it is more than worth the time to have a smooth, creamy bowl of steaming authentic oatmeal.  Sprinkle on some raisins and brown sugar, with a touch of milk (or better yet, cream) and you are on your way to culinary heaven!  The body and slightly nutty taste of McCann's oatmeal are far superior to any instant brand; no cardboard taste here. It's the real thing and a treat to treasure!"
5,"I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead."
5,"I just recently received a box of this tea along with a box of the ""shades of jade"". I was incredibly impressed with both. This is a wonderfully smooth black tea without any trace of bitterness. I like mine with milk and sugar and it the tea flavor stood up well to both. Works perfectly in my Senseo. Now if only I could find coffee pods I liked this much."
5,"We are in hog heaven here. The choices of pesto are amazing and not expensive. Today we had incredible sandwiches at work with pesto/cilantro instead of mayo. Will be re-ordering for sure!"
5,"....but I was WRONG. Wow! I am normally just a plain old soap kind of guy. I don't really care much for anything too smelly, and the body washes I have tried (received as a gift or used in a resort) have left me feeling that I would never want to try a body wash. Either I got hives (yes, that happened with H20 brand), or it just left a film. Well, Dove Men + Care is a different story. It smells good, not just nice, but really good....and my wife likes it, too, she said, ""It has a manly smell."" I'm not sure what that means, but it was said in a positive way, so that's good with me. It also rinses off easily, and my skin did actually feel softer without feeling filmy. As for the ""smell,"" it's a crisp aroma, not musky and not woodsy. If you can imagine what ""clean"" ice would smell like (if there were such a thing), that is as close as I can get. It is not an overpowering aroma at all. Lastly, the container is perfect. It stands upside down very nicely and allows gravity to keep it at the dispensing end, which is great. As for value, well, I believe there is some value here. Each of these are fairly large, and should last for a while, so for the price, you are getting quite a lot. All-in-all, this is a winner!"
5,"I order this this tea every couple of months and am always amazed at how quickly it comes.  The packaging is perfect and I have never had any problems with it."
5,"My Dad introduced us to Skinner's years ago. We are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal. We have some dissenters in the family and I am controversial because I prefer my skinner's on the soggy side as that allows all the flavor to emerge from the cereal. One look at the nutritional value of Skinner's versus Post or Kellogg's on the basis of sodium (skinner's very low) and fiber (skinner's very high) will tell you to give this a try. I admit the taste is maybe not for everybody as it isn't sweet but I have always found it to have a raisin in every bite and we enjoy it."
5,"The Moonstruck Chocolate Milk Chocolate Mayan Bar is the perfect balance between spice and chocolate.  With the first bite you feel the richness of the milk chocolate on your tongue mixed with the mild bite of cinnamon and crunch of chopped almonds. Once you swallow, you are struck by the soft heat of the cinnamon on the back of your throat.  It was the best chocolate I have ever had!"
5,"I started drinking Goji juice a few months ago, per the request of an acupuncturist, and ever since I tried it, I've been hooked. Supposedly it's a ""blood builder,"" but don't expect super fast results for that function. While it might kick in eventually, it does take awhile, but the overall nutritive qualities of this food are near close to being unparalleled: it is a super food and anyone looking for an ULTRA healthy pick-me-up would do good to try this out. It is chock full of Amino Acids and many vital minerals and is deeply fortifying. It also adds a nice dose of Vitamin C, which is helpful in the cold and flu season. Drink to good health!"
5,"I bought this for my sister.  Who is an coffee LOVER, and she informed me that it is very good coffee.  I also ordered the Maple flavored and she loved that as well."
5,"Our vet recommended these chews for our standard poodle; we bought our first bag from them. Amazon's price is much better than we paid at our vet's office. Our dog LOVES these chews, and they never upset his stomach. His teeth look much whiter; they really help with tartar buildup. At the vet's recommendation, I cut them in half. They still work great and last twice as long."
5,"Tinkyada brand is hands down the best GF pasta around.  I hear Biaglut is also good, I have not tried that one, and I hear it is much more expensive then Tinkyada.  So I will stick with this one!! I love it!!"
5,"If you haven't tried these then you're missing out.  These chocolate covered cookies truly melt in your mouth and have none of the ""waxy"" phoney kind of taste you can get with cheap chocolate treats."
5,"My dogs love them ! Just know they come in different thickness also . I bought small/med not knowing and they went quick . Heavy chewers need thick or jumbo . They were odor free also !"
5,"Had been watching Food Network shows and kept seeing Smoked Paprika, but had not found any in our local stores. We now use this on almost all meats. Absolutely love the flavor."
5,"For someone with a gluten problem this is the best spaghetti on the market, without a doubt."
5,"This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it. [...]Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website. [...] Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. [...]. In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected."
5,"This is a very hearty, tasty oatmeal. It takes ten minutes to cook, so not quick but definitely worth the wait."
5,"After eating muir tomato products you will never settle for supermarket brands again.The diced tomato with Italian herbs is heaven sent and also organic so its good for you."
5,"- Green tea tropical is everything its name entails, it's both a relaxing and a zinger! It's helps ease a stressful day and wakes you up in the morning. The combination of flavors enhances the green tea which I am usually not a big fan of, but with Green Tea Tropical I can get all the benefits of Green Tea with an enhanced flavor too! There is no wrong way to do this tea, I really enjoyed it iced, with and without creamer and the tea bags after wards were a very relaxing eye soother."
5,"It's rare you find something that so firmly skews the line between dessert and health food. I've got these on subscription and go through one a day with my morning tea or coffee. Kashi knocked it out of the park with this one. Not too much chocolate and great crunchiness and mix of nuts."
5,"These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)"
5,"With the recent recalls and bad health-related notifications of cat & dog food treats, I wanted to try a new treat that seemed healthy, easy to store, and above all...Made in the USA!  I tried these PureBites.  Both my cats & dog absolutely clammer for them.  You get a lot of bite sized freeze-dried chicken breast pieces & they are low in calories.  With 3 pets, the bag will last through a month. The cost is worth it to me....for the safety and happiness of my pets.  Will continue to order these."
5,"Love these. Almost out after 3 weeks.<br />This little piggy re-ordering.<br />Received in fair amount of time, by the way"
5,"These sardines are very nice indeed.  Everything as advertised.  They are mild tasting...even a bit bland by themselves.  I enjoy spicing them up with some of my favorite hotsauce.  They make a terrific and healthful addition to a meal or are very good for a nutritious snack."
5,"Enough of these misinformation.<br /><br />The FDA has investigated this product since 2007 and have not found any problems with the product.  FDA recently issued updated report dated 3/9/2012.<br /><br />Google:<br />""Questions and Answers Regarding Chicken Jerky Treats from China"" by March 9, 2012 issued by FDA<br /><br />""<br />What is FDA testing for?<br />Since 2007, FDA has been actively investigating the cause of illness in pets reported in association with the consumption of chicken jerky products. Samples have been tested by FDA laboratories, by the Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (Vet-LRN), and by other animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S for multiple chemical and microbiological contaminants.<br />Product samples were tested for Salmonella, metals, furans, pesticides, antibiotics, mycotoxins, rodenticides, nephrotoxins (such as aristolochic acid, maleic acid, paraquat, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, toxic hydrocarbons, melamine and related triazines) and were screened for other chemicals and poisonous compounds. DNA verification was conducted on these samples to confirm the presence of poultry in the treats. Samples have also been submitted for nutritional composition (which includes glycerol concentrations), vitamin D excess and enterotoxin analysis. Some samples from recent cases (2011-2012) have been submitted for multiple tests and we are awaiting results. More samples are in the process of being collected for testing.<br /><br />What are the results of testing?<br />Samples collected from all over the United States have been tested for a wide variety of substances and to date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses.<br /><br />Has there been any indication that metal contamination in chicken jerky products may be the cause of illness in dogs?""<br />FDA's previous testing of chicken jerky product samples did not show toxic levels of metals. In addition, results from March 2012 toxic metal analyses, which included tests for heavy metals, have again shown samples of chicken jerky products to be negative for toxic metals.<br />""<br /><br />Amazon,  please continue sale of this product.  I have been a loyal buyer for the past 4 years and this has consistently been her favourite treat, second only to home-made Chicken Jerky fresh from the oven."
5,"The Kind Healthy Grains line of cereals (I've tried both the vanilla blueberry and the cinnamon ones) are by far my favorite gluten-free breakfast cereals. They have a very nice flavor and texture (though I wouldn't mind if it was a little less sweet) and provide enough substance to keep me reasonably full with no negative digestional reactions.<br /><br />It seems like a nice, balanced nutritional content that will be attractive (and tasty) even for those who aren't in need of the gluten-free aspect.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on a subscription basis as it's not yet available in our local grocery stores."
5,"Nutritious and delicious-need I say more?  Baby loves it-mom is happy.  The product is easy to carry everywhere, easy to use and store, squeezes right into the spoon for travelling.  Excellent!"
5,"These Mi-Del Pecan cookies are excellent!  They are, like all gluten free stuff pretty hard (like trying to eat a poker chip) but if you dunk them in coffee, milk or (I use) Root Beer they soften up nice and taste great!"
5,"I dont care what the vet said he/she also say nothing of the side affect when giving your pet shots and whenever you ask a question it should take 3 minutes to answer but they are busy and only say a few seconds worth UTI's arent cause by a food but ingredient cats NEED water but not water from a bowl cats in the wild get water from meats they eat so they dont drink much causing stress on organs especially on the bladder a kidneys so I feed cut up raw chicken breast very small every 2 days and also feed wet every other day and you MUST have a grain free food to fully stop organ and body problems such as infections pains joints anything even shedding yes shedding is controlled by food so get a good food you can afford yet your cat can live and not survive on vet only get a few hours of nutrition classes provided by Science Diet so dont ask them about brands go research and look even Newman owns is good so id evolve to name a few local store brands"
5,"I use this yeast to make bread in my bread machine, and it works beautifully.  I repackaged it into a small jar that I keep in the refrigerator, storing the rest in an airtight container in the freezer and refilling my jar as needed.  It's much less expensive than buying yeast by the envelope or even by the jar."
5,"My little dog enjoys this toy quite a lot.  He hasn't quite figured out how the treats come out yet, but he's always happy when they do!  LOL!"
5,"This is exactly what I wanted and because of the packaging you do not need to refrigerate before you open them.  I do wish that amazon sold unsweetened regular soy milk for this price but alas...they do not.  I am not in anyway disappointed with this product though and while I cannot use it as a dairy substitute when I am cooking, I love it in the morning or for making protein shakes. You will not regret buying this and you can take all year to drink them if you want."
5,"I LOVE THIS TEA!!  Cannot find it on Supermarket Shelves anymore.  Used to be in my safeway!!  I share with my daughter in California!!"
5,"Great bottle. I got the ones suggested by Best Baby Products (Consumer Reports book): Evenflo Classic, Dr. Brown's and BornFree, all of them are great but BornFree is better. The only bad thing is that you can't get the glass ones in stores."
5,"When I serve this risotto garnished with thin slabs of Parmesan, someone always asks for the recipe - testimonial enough.  I have made it into risotto pancakes as an appetizer or side dish.  The pancakes are always consumed with gusto!"
5,"My doctor prescribed yogurt for my diet. For most people that would be fine, but the texture gags me! Using Cocoa Beach as a topping, however, has turned the ""punishment"" to ""pleasure."" I love this stuff!"
5,"These are my favorite candies of all time! I love the spicy, chewy flavor. It's so hard to find delicious Ginger foods and candies (except online) and I'm so happy that Amazon started carrying these products by the Ginger people. I usually purchase the little tiny bags at a specialty store and it is $5.99 for a really small bag of candies.<br /><br />I melt these in a cup of boiling water for a really delicious late-night tea. These are great for nausea, too.<br /><br />Great for travel sickness, great for morning sickness, and just great taste when you want a really spicy candy. I love them! They actually sell these at the little executive airport in my hometown. The pilots use them.<br /><br />Recommended!"
5,"I'm trying to get more fiber in my diet, and these are terrific. Real food, great taste (better than chocolate caramel variety of these bars which have a few kernels of embedded popcorn which are really inedible). I'm changing my subscribe & save to switch these for the chocolate caramel which I thought were good until I found these."
5,"The flavor of CALM is great and the children love it too.  Prefer liquid supplements and because of strenuous workouts, needed to take calcium magnesium supplements.  Got pills and was not taking them regularly because i generally don't like taking pills.  A friend had this product, and after i tried it,was hooked.  Just add to water and it is delicious!"
5,"I have four cats at home and they love this stuff. If they were in charge of shopping for their own food, this is what they would buy along with freeze-dried chicken treats. I've fostered occasionally for rescue and I've never encountered a cat that didn't take to this food immediately. The main risk with it is that your cats' taste will get hopelessly spoiled and they might start refusing other foods if you tend to feed a variety. For this reason, I use this food sparingly as a treat, generally no more than once a week."
5,"The baking mix is excellent. I've had great results with the muffins, scones, cookies and banana bread recipes on the package, and I look forward to trying more of Pamela's recipes. I've also had very good results substituting the mix in those impossible pie recipes that are so tasty. This is the best gluten-free product I've ever bought. I'll be buying more for sure. It's also a good bargain."
5,"I first discovered these bars a few years ago at a local shop but the shop later went out of business.  Some months ago a friend surprised me with a gift of them from Amazon.  Since then I ordered them for myself.<br /><br />The silky dark chocolate of the candy bar smothers a variety of nuts and rich buttery-toffee popcorn. The chocolate is so thick and dense I use a knife to cut slices of the bar so every single morsel becomes a bit of nirvana."
5,"You can't beat this deal! 3 Boxes of 16 K-Cups for little more then $20. No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!"
5,"The ingredients in this seems to be better then ""Fancy Feast"" which is mostly fat. I have one finicky cat and one who will eat anything. Both love it. It is a good every other day [half way healthy] treat for them."
5,"I'm addicted to Yogi Teas and have vowed to try them all.  This Indian Spice tea is delicious. I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.<br />The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy."
5,"I read the ingredients and this is a nutritious and high fiber product. As expected the muffins and pancakes are not light and fluffy, but that's due to not being a refined flour. I find this to be exactly what I expected and easy to bake with (just be sure you have baking powder on hand). I've experimented with the muffins and find them to be the density of the bran muffins you might find at the store. There is a grainy undertaste but it's not a bad taste--just not white flour. I will use this product again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a healthier baking product or who is trying to eat a lower carb diet (it's good for diabetics too)."
5,"Same flavor and taste as I remember as a kid 60yrs ago. Not as big as they use to be, but still very good."
5,"We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt."
5,"If you are single like me and always throwing out spoiled milk, this is the way to go.  You have complete control over the richness of taste you are looking for, it mixes quick and easy, and I believe it tastes better than fresh skim (of course I add a bit extra to the mix).  No more going to the fridge, finding the milk has spolied, and having to make a last minute trip to the store.  Having tried a few different brands, this is hands down the best.  Not going to be trying any more.  This one is it.  Wish there was more convenient packaging, but was worth finding space for it on my shelves."
5,"Enjoy Life Foods sent us four boxes of their new crunchy cookies to taste test. Dr. J now recognizes their label! He wanted to taste test the Double Chocolate first, and of course this chocoholic mommy did not protest!<br /><br />Remember, Enjoy Life Foods products are free of the top 8 food allergens. Could that kind of product make a double chocolate cookie that tastes ""real""?<br /><br />Um, YES! My mouth waited for the rice aftertaste, but it couldn't find one. Enjoy Life Foods created a chocolate taste on par with homemade, and the crunch satisfied! The boys loved them, as you can see, but I was elated! I confess I hid the rest of the box and saved them for me, though guilt did kick in later and I shared one more with them, ha!<br /><br />Now, it would have been very easy to gorge ourselves and eat all four boxes at once, but I needed to test these cookies on a non gluten- and dairy-free eater...Daddy! The next night we had another taste test, this time trying two cookies: Chocolate Chip and Vanilla Honey Graham. Again the boys loved them! And Daddy? My pickiest taste tester of all things allergy-friendly? What was his verdict?<br /><br />Good! He preferred the chocolate chip, but said the Vanilla Honey Graham was decent. There's an ever-so-slight after taste to the graham cookies, but Meatball didn't seem to mind!<br /><br />If you've been counting, there is one more flavor left--Sugar Crisp. Now, I grew up with a Type 1 diabetic mom. The sugar cookies she made were reduced sugar, and I loved them. Most other sugar cookies were always too sweet for me. I figured this would be the case as well, and Daddy and Meatball would get the bulk of the sugar cookies.<br /><br />Wrong! When I bit into my first Sugar Crisp, I was amazed. There was a buttery flavor to it. I grabbed the box--was there some mistake? Was dairy hidden there and somehow Enjoy Life Foods missed it, marketed it wrong? What were the ingredients? How did they get that flavor?<br /><br />I don't know! But there's still no dairy in there! The Sugar Crisp had just the right sweetness, and of course the same satisfying crunch. I ate a lot of them. At first Dr. J didn't want them because they looked a whole lot like another sugar cookie he had tried and not liked. I asked him to please try a bite, and of course he didn't like them. However, after two days of watching Mommy and Meatball eat them, he finally gave them another taste, and was quite happy to consume some himself!<br /><br />I think we can happily say Enjoy Life Foods Crunchy Cookies will definitely be a back up plan for when Mommy forgot to make cookies and we need to take a treat somewhere. My flavor preferences in order were: Double Chocolate, Chocolate Chip and Sugar Crisp tied (seriously, who would have thought!), and finally the Vanilla Honey Graham. Some of you will be able to find them in your local allergy-friendly grocery stores now, and some of you will need to be watching (and ASKING) for them as Enjoy Life Foods continues to get them into the market. You all have my permission to eat two Double Chocolate cookies when you get them--one for you, and one for me!<br /><br />Enjoy Life Foods sent us their Crunchy Cookies for taste testing and honest review. All opinions, and cookie crumbs in the keyboard, are my own. You can learn more about these cookies and their other new products here at their website. I also want to thank them for donating crunchy cookies to our Southeast Michigan Spectrum Moms family picnic in May."
5,"This is a very tasty and well sized lunch. However, the nutritional information is for half a serving. There's no way you will only eat half of it."
5,"This is simply the best tea that I have ever found.  The flavors are incredible when combined with sweetener and half and half. Amazon offers this tea at a great price and shipping to my door so I don't have to take a chance on finding it at the store.  If you are looking for a fabulous tasting tea...look no further!  It's here!"
5,"Best tasting bar ever!  Perfect for a quick snack or to take hiking.... I tried other flavors but like this one the best.  Not too many calories but good for you..."
5,"I so love this. When I was overseas Fanta was all I wanted to drink. I think if shipping wasn't so much I would buy it more.. But it's the best thing ever/"
5,"Perfect subsistence for every meal of every day. The cereal has a bland appearance but has a very mild honey taste that makes you want to keep pouring bowl after bowl. There's only 8 grams of sugar per serving in Gorrila Munch and it is completely organic, making it the perfect choice for parents trying to feed their children a health yet tasty breakfast. On top of all that, EnviroKidz did a beautiful job with the cereal's packaging by including a very comforting portrait of a gorilla on the front of the box"
5,"Harney & Sons' Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea is one of the cleanest and most delicate of commercially-available teas I've encountered.<br /><br />My first experience with it was at the Williamsburg Lodge, in Virginia, where it was served over the 3 days of an annual convention I attend there.  While a shame to have to sip it standing up or moving between speaker sessions, I had a remarkable sense of being elevated above the rush around me.  The bouquet is evocative and tended to linger in the air yet was in no way overpowering... more like a stroll through a jasmine-studded garden.  Upon tasting, the first impression seems to register near the tip of the tongue, as if sweet, and as the flavor develops in the mouth there is a recognition that it is, in fact, tea but without insistent tannic or other strong overtones.  A fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of breath recharges the sensation.<br /><br />There is no settling of heavy flavors-- a cup is as fine and pleasurable from first sip to last.  I also have found that this tea maintains its character despite the array of waters I have used to make it.  Some brews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral-rich well water or treated city water.  The best experience no doubt is when using filtered water, but it is not requisite to enjoying Jasmine Pearl.<br /><br />As a wake-me-up tea on a work morning, I would likely choose a more robust leaf.  However, for a proper moment of relaxation-- or an attempt to induce one in the midst of chaos!-- I hope to never run out of this tea."
5,"These chocolates are much better than 5 stars!<br /><br />We found a Leonidas' Shop during a visit to Brussels, Belgium earlier this year and brought home 4 of the ""kilo"" Assortment Ballotins.  I was ready to call directly to Brussels to place an order for more, but found them in New York City, so.........no need to search further.<br /><br />The quality is outstanding and as other have already stated, far superior to other brands and MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE.<br /><br />The shipment arrives overnight and each ballotin is protected in it's own styrofoam case.<br /><br />Try an assortment (the dark is unbelievably decadent) and you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Enjoy"
5,"A good cup of decaf coffee is hard to get but if you like a strong coffee, this one is the best!"
5,"The bar is a great snack to eat when I'm in a hurry. It's has a great taste and a chewy texture. Also, it's satisfying to get that nice crunch when you bite right into one of the almonds. The only problem I have is that it's hard to just eat one. I often find myself reaching for more. The fiber content is also an added bonus. Overall, this bar is a great, healthy alternative for a snack.<br /><br />For those who want the nutrition facts: it has 170 calories, 11g fat (5g from saturated fat), 16g carbs (13g sugar), and 4g protein."
5,"A very nice graham cracker, with a robust oat/flavor. Very crunchy. The ""hint of cinnamon"" is definitely easy to taste, yet adds a nice flavor that is just sweet enough due to the honey.  This is a cracker that is just sweet and savory enough to serve as a sweet snack, but also was very yummy with cheese or peanut butter.  I love graham crackers and this one is great."
5,"He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL. These are a just a little bigger than a pencil eraser. They are great for training. I like to cut them in half to yield even more. I tried cutting them in quarters but they seem a little too small for my dogs big mouth. They come in a resealable package so that helps to keep them nice and fresh and especially soft. I forgot to close the bag one day and the treats got pretty hard but the dog didn't mind."
5,"I do not generally prefer dark chocolate or pomegranate, but this product is AMAZING! The company is able to combine two things and make them taste even better. I can't just eat one and it's a party for your mouth."
5,"Our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years, his stomach has become particularly sensitive. We tried various brands of dog food before settling on Newman's Own. Our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach. It is hard to find though. I was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and I was paying almost twice as much as on Amazon. Now I have it set up on Amazon to ship monthly."
5,"Our puggle's weight had ballooned to almost 40 pounds--at least 10 pounds too heavy--and we weren't willing to feed her a low-quality food full of by-products and weird stuff after making the switch to holistic foods a few years ago. Just three months after starting on Wellness Healthy Weight, she has shed several pounds and is well on her way to being at her ideal weight again. Our other, healthy-weight dog has also been eating this food without any noticeable weight gain or loss and without having any food allergy flare-ups. The best part is that both dogs love the food, and they are both picky, picky eaters. If you're looking for a high-quality, no-filler holistic food to help your lazy, treat-filled pooch lose some of those extra pounds, give this one a try."
5,"This is a great product! The label said it was packaged at the end on January, so it was very fresh. These are really good out of the bag, but I prefer to toast them by just putting some in a pan medium pan for a couple of minutes. I have been adding different things to my low carb diet and this is one of my favorites because of the low carbs. About 2 net carbs per 3 tablespoons."
5,"I have not picked this item up on Amazon but in a retail store in my area in North Carolina.  I had seen it on Amazon but when I saw it local I gave it a try and I am glad I did.  This is a rich and robust flavor, with a note of nuts, one that wipes the cobwebs away in the morning.  Yes it is nice that the product uses less plastic but that is only a side note the quality of the coffee is top notch.  The only negative side comment I can make is that sometimes the top gets stuck on the upper needle of the Keurig but no problem just pull it off from the top rather than picking it up out of the brewing basket, and if you close the machine and open again it is always off the needle anyway."
5,"It is a great coffee substitute without the caffeine.  Taste is pretty close too."
5,"Okay, so I'm biased.  I love dark chocolate, and I love blueberries.  I'm not sure of any health benefits associated with them, but I can say this,  they are delicious and very satisfying."
5,"Lily's dark chocolate bars are clearly made from high quality chocolate. There's only a tiny bit of dairy, and the sweetener is stevia, among the few healthy sweeteners. Despite being healthy :) these bars are as good or better than the not healthy ones. I prefer them to the famous name bars, as does my husband who likes the Lily's bar that has almonds (also good for you)."
5,"This is the BEST Jamaican Jerk Marinade you can buy......Marinade something....anything....overnight....and grill it the next day, and bam, bom boom waka-kazow!!!  it's just a little bit hotter than tabasco....but the heat doesn't last long or hurt.....even for you wimps out there, that can't handle a jalapeno potato chip, you should be fine...if you're not a you know what.......which you probably are!  anyway....this stuff smells and tastes like Voodoo...or Voudoun for you purists.....but that signifies that it is magick.....vegetables, meats.....put it on everything.....I just had two corn on the cobs that I marinaded last night....cooked them on the grill and all I can say is MMM....MMMMM...MMMMM.........btw....try marinading scallops or shrimp with this stuff and then grill it....you'll be amazed....unless you're such a weakling that you whine and say ""ehhhhh....waaaah....it's too hot""<br />it's NOT too hot...you're just a damn candy azz.......I've never met anyone that doesn't like this stuff.....including a close friend of mine that won't eat it....yeah, a wimp.....but every time she smells it...she says....""OMG....that smells delicious""......if you have a stomach problem....fine....don't eat it....but if you are healthy and a man or woman of integrity.....you should at least TRY it....before you turn your fat nose up at it.....once you try it....you'll crave it like a drug....."
5,"This product alternates between being available and not available.  Steel cut oats from Ireland can't be much different than steel cut oats from North Dakota.  Oats is oats.  The can is great and because of the can I would highly reccomend buying this once and then refilling the can with cheaper local oats."
5,"I love this product because it tastes as good as a basic homemade version.  You can add your own vegetables and other seasonings to create a great soup.  I also use it as a stock base for sauces, soups and replacement for water when cooking rice and grains.  There is no leftover stock to worry about.  One can is used for 1 cup rice.  The product came timely and bubble wrapped."
5,"Undoubtedly, the best tasting gluten-free pasta out there. It doesn't break, isn't mushy, and tastes just like regular pasta. You can serve this to guests and no one would know it's gluten free, trust me!!"
5,"Standard milk chocolate mini-eggs are easy to find in your standard grocery store.  They are pretty good, but these dark chocolate eggs are better.  I highly recommend these if you enjoy dark chocolate.  Unfortunately they are difficult to find in stores."
5,"We have a Farberware percolator and have found these filter to be the best to keep grounds out of the coffee.  Use them once or twice a day."
5,"When vacationing Adam and Barbara Maitland meet their demise when they are killed by a local dog,(don't worry, you'll laugh your head off at this,) they are transported into a world of mystery. Tim Burton takes you an a hilarious journey into the afterlife. Danny Elfman once again pairs up with Tim so they can work their movie magic, creating a roller coaster of a movie score. Beetlejuice will leave you laughing 'til you cry,(or just crying.)"
5,"I went gluten free about 6 months ago and initially it was a struggle to figure out what to eat in the mornings.  I missed the crunch and texture of cereals and toast.  I first found Perky's Crunchy Flax at a major health food grocer, but it was priced over a dollar higher per box.  I was thrilled to find the bulk deal on Amazon as the boxes aren't very large and between my husband and I, we tend to go through at least 3 boxes a week.  This cereal is filling and delicious--I simply eat it with vanilla almond milk and it's perfect.  My husband likes to add a little honey to sweeten, but I don't feel it's necessary.  The cereal doesn't get soggy quickly at all, by the way.  It's proven a healthy and easy breakfast option and become a daily staple."
5,"I cannot fathom anyone not loving this combination of chocolate and p-nut butter cups.  I have a sweet tooth (much to the delight of my dentist) and this candy sure does help to satisfy my craving!"
5,"Love it. This a great combo pack if you like strong, bold espresso at home. I will definitely purchase again."
5,"These are even better than Girl Scout cookies and most likely healthier.  If you are into weight watchers.  You may eat two of these absolutely delicious cookies for 3 points.  These are so satisfying.  After eating, two quickly put the box away, because you will want more."
5,"This sea salt is a fantastic deal.  It has a wonderful flavor, perfect for sprinkling on food and in cooking.  It is so much healthier than other store bought salts, especially the iodized salts that just ruin your food.  The price is extremely cheap ~  you just cannot beat!  REAL NICE DEAL!!  FAST & SAFE SHIPPING TOO!"
5,"Great price! I'm amazed at the hard to assemble collection of Space Food.<br />They taste great for all occasions. You don't need to be camping or on a Russian Soyuz rocket."
5,"This is truly rich and satisfying cup of coffee. I have been drinking it for years. It is truly equal to the best coffee I have tasted in any coffee shop.Another surprise is that is always consistent from order to order. My newest favorite coffee is now the Emerels Big Easy. Just a tad richer with a wonderful aftertaste. I will be alternating these two wonderful blends, for years to come."
5,"With almost too few carbohydrates to count, these little wraps are perfect for diabetics. They come in assorted ""flavors"", but I can't taste the difference. No matter, as they serve their purpose in getting food into my mouth. If you are, like me, avoiding all bread, you will love these wraps for making ""sandwiches"" that will not spike your blood sugar count whatsoever."
5,"Nina, Sam(antha) and Grizzly are ""licking it up.""  The feature that appeals to me most is that the calorie count is so low per ""taste.""  It's a real snack alternative that many of us with pets should consider!<br /><br />Great idea!<br /><br />I rate ""PetSafe Lickety Stik 1.6-Fluid Ounce, Bacon Flavor""...Five stars!<br /><br />P.S., As many pet snacks are notoriously high in fat, I truly recommend this as a low-calorie alternative!<br /><br />P.P.S., Maybe they should come up with on for us humans?  Just a thought!"
5,"i'm korean, so my family always has a box of shin ramyun at home.<br />They are always so useful when my family has nothing to eat.<br />As some reviewers mentioned, ramyun contains msg, so even though they taste good<br />they are not the healthiest food on earth.<br /><br />Anyways, i'm reading reviews that say that vegetables are too stiff<br />and that they dont like too much soup in their ramyun.<br />As it says on the back of every package,<br />put in the amount of water they recommend.<br />boil the water.<br />add the vegetables and the noodle.<br />let the noodle... become noodles.by boiling it longer, then the vegetables will turn soft too.<br />add the soup.<br />cook a little bit more so that the soup sinks it.<br />but  dont let the noodles become overcooked (it's when the noodles turn fat cause they soak up the soup)<br />and most koreans add rice to the soup after cause .. that's what we do.<br /><br />and you could basically anything to ramyun to make it taste better.<br />many people add egg, some people include kimchi, and only some likes to put on a sheet of american cheese on top (like me.. but put only one,)<br /><br />and shin ramyun is really hot. but you get used to it."
5,"I used to buy one of those Purina brands for both my dogs which was fine at first. Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other brands, it had too much filler. My pets seem to be much happier, more energetic, much healthier looking, and have less smelly farts."
5,"PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)"
5,"The new Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheeseburger kit is fantastic! A one skillet meal that uses creamy Velveeta instead of powdered ""cheese flavoring""? Awesome! I found this to be far superior to the similar Hamburger Helper flavor. While it IS rich, it makes a great, quick meal with a side salad."
5,"My husband loves a STRONG cup of coffee and this one makes his favorite dark roast list.  It is smooth and flavorful with no bitter taste. If you are looking for a strong expresso shot, this probably wouldn't make it."
5,"Many snacks labeled ""healthy"" today still have hydrogenated oils in them.  Garden of eatin' snacks do not.  The taste is wonderful.  Great with salsa and/or guacamole.  The sesame seeds add a nice flavor without being overpowering.  My favorite chip for all occasions."
5,"Yes you may need to take a second mortgage out to afford this dog food but it is the first dog food that my dog is not allergic too.  So far so good as he doesn't itch anymore or bite his paws.<br />Just wish Amazon had free shipping and a subcription available, that could drive down the cost!"
5,"I've used this broth since it came out... it is simply the best. It has a rich, mushroom flavor, which is perfect for making a pot of mushrooms gravy. It is also nice to make barley soup with.<br /><br />I use this and the low-sodium vegetable broth from Pacific to start every dish I make, and I cook daily. They both add complex flavor to any dish, with no work at all."
5,"This is a very good coffee, grown in an enviromentally sound manner- organic, fair trade, AND shade grown.  All very important for our enviroment.  The price is very reasonable."
5,"My Husband loves these and he said they are just like the ones he is used to :). He was born and raised here but his grandma was always bringing and sending Mexican candy and this is the kind he grew up on."
5,"My 9 month old Yorkie puppy is a finicky eater.  When he is in the mood, he gobbles down Stella & Chewy's dreeze dried patties.  He likes the beef the best, but will occasionally eat the duck-duck and chicken.  I have a friend who has larger dogs and they are on a raw food diet and love these patties.  Their coats are so shiny and I have found that my Yorkie's coat is beginning to also shine."
5,"This is one of the best coffees I have ever had for my Keurig.  It is a nice smooth coffee.  And the price is the best price I could find.  I will be buying more."
5,"In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But, if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add."
5,"We love this tea.  It is no longer available in our local grocery chain so we purchased from Amazon.  Glad it's available online and will continue to order from Amazon."
5,"I was concerned about the effect ""regular"" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  ""high-end"" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!"
5,"This was a big hit at work. Each gummi was smaller than the normal one you would find in the larger packs, but the overall concensus was that they were ""softer"" in texture when chewing!"
5,"I was looking for a whole wheat Matzo (we use them to make mini-pizzas in the toaster oven) and there wasn't one available at any of the local stores.  I have been trying to switch my family over to as many whole grain products as possible.  These taste excellent, have much more fiber than the regular matzos, etc.  Couldn't be better.  The calorie content was only about 10-15 more than the non-whole-grain ones we'd been eating too - but the matzo squares are significantly larger so that's part of it.  Excellent product; a couple did arrive cracked or broken but not really an issue."
5,"better than grahm crakers and they do not spike your blood sugar (at least not mine.)"
5,"This is basically mashed up pasta with carrots and I guess pureed chicken. Some jars seem to be chunkier than others... My daughter really enjoys it. I got some broken jars once and Amazon was great with their customer service. Highly recommend."
5,"These are my husband's favorite chips. He loves the tangy flavor and crunch. When we serve these to guests they all rave about them."
5,"THIS IS A VERY DELICIOUS PRODUCT AND ENJOYABLE ANY TIME OF THE<br /><br />DAY ! NATURE VALLEY MAKES ONE OF THE BEST SNACKS I KNOW."
5,"My family LOVES this chicken.  I mean they LOVE it, they devour it.  Which is a bit surprising if you take into consideration we live in the deepest part of the deep south.  Our tastes usually run along the lines of grits or boiled peanuts.  But this buttery curry chicken is just magical.  My 11 year old son says it looks like someone ""cooked chicken in Hershey's Syrup"" but the taste... oh my.  We have tried other mixes, have tried home made.  None compare.  This is the golden standard for us.  YUMMY!"
5,"After spending more on allergen-free food from my vet than I spend on groceries for myself, I looked for a reasonable option for my special-needs kitty who is apparently allergic to something in regular cat food.<br /><br />This food is way cheaper than specialty food from the vet, and my cat's allergic reactions slowly went away after we switched. It smells like death, but it works."
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EUN6"">Sugar Twin Spoonable Brown</a><br />This is great product that is not at my local grocery. I like to use it in my hot cereal. It doesn't have sugar in it like Splenda brown sugar does."
5,"I've tried all the store stuffing mixes and some were fair and some were bad.  But this product was really tasty with a very good texture.  If Amazon keeps selling it, I will keep buying it."
5,"My lab absolutely loves this toy.  He acts like a puppy when he plays with it."
5,"Steel Cut Oats are far superior to rolled oats. If you already like oatmeal, you should really give it a try. If you don't you will find this as a better, more flavorful alternative. I eat steel cut oats for breakfast a lot, and Bob's is one of the best for quality and value."
5,"My husband started a gluten free diet for Celiac and cereal is a daily meal for breakfast.  This box did not last 3 days."
5,"If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
5,"I love oloves!! I have tried finding them in the US for a year and am so thankful that they are now available! They are tender delicate olives, just like the ones you get in Spain. They are conveniently packaged to be taken anywhere you go. Before I was able to purchase them on Amazon I would purchase the United box meal that included them just so I could get my Olove fix!"
5,"well one of the best you just have to have a copy of this."
5,"This is the best syrup we've tried so far and we will be buying it again."
5,"I really missed the taste and crunch of pretzels since having to go gluten free a few years ago. These pretzels are just as I remembered regular pretzels to be in every way!<br /><br />However, I do have to get them from a local store, because of the shipping costs here. It would be great to have these on the Subscribe and Save list."
5,"This is, so far, my very favorite protein shake.<br /><br />If you love coffee then you should follow the directions- the mocha flavor is nice and strong in 12 oz of fluid (I do milk, to up the protein content; more on that later).  If you like coffee with chocolate flavor then this is the mix for you!<br /><br />Personally, I like putting 16 oz of milk in a Blender Bottle (with the genius blender ball) and then two scoops of Click powder.  I personally love mocha when the chocolate is predominant with a hint of coffee, and this tastes like chocolate milk with a delicious coffee undertone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the protein content is a little bit low (15g per serving) and it's $1.50 a serving.  Honestly, it's so good that the money is worth it.  It's also way less spendy- at least half the cost of your average drink- than getting a mocha at a coffee stand and far healthier.  As far as the protein goes, if I do the 16 oz of milk then I get 33 grams of protein in a shake.  Not too bad, and again, it tastes so great!<br /><br />As an RNY gastric bypass patient I find it difficult to in 80 grams of protein from shakes per day, particularly because most things just don't taste that great.  This is the first protein drink I've had that is genuinely good, not just, ""Meh, I guess that's ok for a protein drink.""  I fully recommend this to anyone!!<br /><br />Lastly, you can search around for other recipes- some people add a scoop of vanilla protein powder and a splash of drip coffee, or drip coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup, etc.  I also hear Click makes DELICIOUS protein ice cream, and I plan to give that a go in the upcoming weeks.  If it is delicious I'll leave this as is.  If it's nasty (which, based on how great this stuff tastes, then I doubt it will be!) I'll edit my review to reflect that.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
5,"I first discovered this product at a local pet food store. Bella and Dora, our adopted kittens, were suffering from a respitory cold that they had picked up from the shelter and were not eating any food.<br /><br />The girl at the shop was really cool and introduced us to the Weruva line of food as well as other brands. I was interested to find out that the owners of Weruva are somehow related to the company that produces all the tuna for Subway Sandwiches. I guess the husband/wife team had cats and were dissapointed to find low quality soft food in the market, and asked to find out what it would take to be able to use the same facilities. They found out that as long as they produced human grade food, they could use the facility. Anyways, we bought a whole bunch of flavors to see what they would like, and ultimately this is the only one that they always finish!<br /><br />I like that you can tell that it is fish, and not some mushed up by product. It smells very fishy, so if that makes you sick just be aware!<br /><br />Hope your kitties love it as much as ours do!!!"
5,"I really enjoy these Lipton Green Tea Blends. This version is really yummy. It's bright and flavorful but not overpowering.  The best part is you can't taste the green tea, just get the benefits as I don't care for the taste of green tea alone."
5,"These chips are the whole family's favorite. They are just the right size to share, but not so big that they go stale before they are gone. Not greasy - very crispy. What more can be said about tortilla chips?"
5,"This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far."
5,"These Bahlsen Butter Leaves are the best cookies! Not too sweet, not greasy, soooo ""just right!"" Order extra! They go fast!"
5,"this is my third purchase of the fogchaser kcups and i will keep buying it!  The taste is on the darker side, kind of like a SBUX french roast, but much tastier.  The smell from the bag when I open it is just heavenly!  I also like that the cup isn't all plastic, just the plastic top with mesh bottom.  I have had no occurence of the mesh bottom ripping open after about 200 of these."
5,"I do love this product and that is why I buy online because it can not be purchased locally.  However I have to say this time the seller obviously did not do a very good with their packing because most of the product was broken up into pieces and there was a lot of waste at the bottom.  I will not purchase from them again."
5,"I'm afraid to calculate the cost per ounce! Our dog & cat can't get enough of this stuff, but we have to limit this delicacy. I'm thinking of buying a freeze dryer and working out a deal for turkey hearts from the local butcher shop. It has to be more economical. In the meantime, maybe we'll win the lottery. Enjoy!"
5,"I purchased this candy, on vacation, at a candy store in Michigan at the cost of $9.89 per pound plus tax. They are delicious and I wanted more, so I went looking on the internet. I was pleasantly surprised to find the very same candy at a much more reasonable price and they arrived fresher and even better tasting. I have offered them to several friends and family members and they are a hit. Careful, they are addictive! :o)"
5,"The Stash brand teas pass with flying colors by every tea drinker in the office (all English or Russian). The English Breakfast and Earl Grey are their favorites."
5,"It really does taste like crystal pepsi, i will definitely order this again, if only for nostalgia sake. And for those of you wondering, scorched is right, crystal pepsi does taste like flat pepsi with more sugar in it, but it's AWESOME."
5,"I got this after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition, ""Feed your pet Right"". The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types, but LOVE the red snapper, tuna and shrimp, tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food, even if they are picky, like mine."
5,"This stevia valencia orange is great.  I put a few drops in my water bottle as I hate to drink water and it really lightens up the taste and therefore I drink more water.  Like the lemon stevia drops also."
5,"I received the item in a timely manner; having been familiar with the item I ordered I can't comment on the quality, because the quality speaks for itself!!"
5,"Wonderful quality for this excellent eccentric culinary pearl. Reconstitutes very well and has wonderful flavor. This is a mushroom that has medicinal properties due to its pronounced levels of beta-glucans and alpha-glucans which are long chain sugars called polysaccharides known to stimulate the immune system in significant ways. Some caution is due with regular and or excessive use of anything that stimulates the immune system. Love of all. PEACE"
5,"Great taste.  The Blue Diamond flavors are way better than the Emerald flavors.  Great between meals snack that we all eat.  Also grab to put in baggies for lunches."
5,"Hey it's sea salt what more can a person say. I like the maker so I keep buying the product."
5,"This chips kind of reminded me of bacon bits. The six small bags were the perfect size and there's no MSG. They were a little expensive, but considering they came from the UK it's understandable. Half the price was in the shipping. They are well worth the indulgence once in awhile."
5,"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!"
5,"Excellent product.  All natural ingredients (real lemons crystalized into powder form) and only 5 calories (sweetned with Stevia).  This lemonade taste is perfect, my kids and I both love it.  I travel with packets in my purse and we order water now and add a packet of lemonaide instead of going for that soda.  You will love it."
5,"Who knew they could put buffalo wings in a bag?  These pretzel pieces are absolutely wonderful . . . and  . . . a-hem . . . less fattening than actual chicken wings.  All the glory, less fat!  Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!"
5,"The last jar I bought seemed under-salted. Wonder if they heard Americans are afraid of salt these days and changed the recipe. I doctored it my usual way, but with salt added to the usual lime juice and olive oil. I use it on chicken thighs or pork chops. Shallow slashes on the surface of the meat to increase surface area, 24-hour marination in the fridge in a zip-closure plastic bag, chicken pieces skinless. I wouldn't want it on the more delicate flavors of seafood, but whatever floats yer boat."
5,"If I could give this 10 stars I would! I am lactose intolerant and a distance athlete and need to supplement my protein intake. It is very hard to find soy protein in retail stores, as they all sell Whey. Not only does this powder have 14g of protein per serving, but it tastes INCREDIBLE! I mix it with soymilk for even more protein. It is a treat I look forward to after a hard workout. I can't get enough!"
5,"As someone who is sensitive to chemicals in foods, I was very upset when Malt O Meal who mass produced Puffed Wheat stopped. The only other product available to me was Quaker, but that had BHT preservatives in it which set off allergic reactions.<br />Being desperated I tried Arrowhead Mills product and was so grateful it is just puffed wheat without anything else.<br /><br />For people who have eaten enough puffed cereals, they will know that some taste burnt and some are light puffed. This comes from a process where one company explodes the grain in puffing by heating the grain which toasts it and another more modern method which uses steam pressure.<br />It is either the heat or steam pressure which when released which causes the grain to ""puff"".<br /><br />Arrowhead Mills is the toasted type and it is very good. It also unlike the steam pressure or the old Malt O Meal type not as perfected in that it is a bit more crunchy like the original puffed wheat of a century ago.<br /><br />For those with allergies, I believe the toasting makes the product less inflamatory to the body in ""killing"" the oils, germ and hull which affect many people.<br /><br />The bags are small, but surprisingly one can get around 7 bowls of cereal out of them.<br />The puffed wheat is though like all puffed wheat in softening readily in milk, but as stated the packages I have the puffed wheat has a bit more texture like original puffed wheat.<br /><br />I was quite pleased with this product and hope to have it stocked locally. It was good enough for me to even consider purchasing puffed millet in the future.<br /><br />I hope this helps people in their decisions. God bless."
5,"Add 1/4 cup to 2 cups of raw peanuts in a food processor and make homemade peanut butter. Grind till smooth.  (Add 1/4 cup sugar and a tsp of salt if you prefer)"
5,"We had a great time with the sixty count Toblerone box .They are the favorite chocolates of all."
5,"I really like the extra nutrition that brown rice gives over white rice.  I also like the extra nuttiness and depth of flavor that it gives.  Add all of that to Jasmine rice and you have a winning product.  Take that winning product and have it cook in about 20 minutes, just like with white rice and I am SOLD!  I absolutely love the aroma that Jasmine rice gives off, and I love that this product gives me that wonderful aroma, taste, healthiness and a quick meal.  It's just wonderful.  I love this rice!"

5,"Forget the calories -- these almonds are great -- they taste as though they were INFUSED with the chocolate!! A combination of Chocolate-sweet-enough-to-delight the tastebuds, combined with a fresh almond taste.<br />And these almonds are BIG.<br /><br />One almond led to the other and I had to force myself to put the cannister down.<br /><br />Ever the culinary experimenter, I placed some Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds in my Cuisinart and ground them -- then I added the ground almonds to a bowl of freshly made Instant Vanilla pudding -- great taste -- almost like marzipan. I also added some to a smoothie, with positive results.<br /><br />Almonds are a good health food. Chocolate is the 9th wonder of the world, as far as I'm concerned. In my opinion, Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are a great meeting of two ""foodstuffs"" -  eaten right from the canister or as a special ingredient to some of your recipes."
5,"I purchased this for my husband.  He enjoyed it so much, he's had me put it on my Subscribe & Save Subscription so he gets it automatically.  Need I say more?"
5,"These bars have a strong cherry taste, but because they have no sugar, they don't really taste like cherry pie. The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries. The almonds are chopped pretty finely, but still give the bar a bit of crunchiness. I love the taste, but if you're looking for something sweet, you might be disappointed. Each bar has 190 calories and 80 of them are from fat."
5,"I couldn't believe it. I ordered a 4 pound bag of almonds, and that's what I got. They taste just like Almond milk, but in an solid form... not gelatinous like almond butter, but almost like a crunchy nut. They even had all the proper amino acids to promote muscle growth. I would consider ordering these again, but 4lbs of almonds should last me until the end of 2012."
5,"these green mountain k cups are great tasting with my favorite breakfast blend and its very conveninet and the best k cups for me that we like will buy again"
5,"We first had this from our neighbourhood specialty grocery. My wife mocks me but even with shipping the five pound package via Amazon is cheaper. And the bacon is some of the best you will ever have. Well worth it, in our opinion."
5,"Love nuts, but these are the food of the Gods. What a combo of perefectly balanced tastes; and no, I really am just an average consumer. It's a shame these are not more nationally distributed. Outstanding. Wil"
5,"If you like camomile tea...this is the best ever. It is very herbal camomile and great tasting... does not have a weak flavor...even after years of being in my cupboard, it still tastes as fresh as the day I bought it...and I am talking years. I brought it to work to share and everyone that tasted it loved it. Try it and you won't be disappointed...I'll bet you will love it too. Good things and pleasures in life are ment to be shared... enjoy"
5,"Best thing I've ordered on line. Quality espresso blend - not too bitter but strong coffee. Perfect espresso grind for my Italian espresso machine. I keep buying it over & over - beats locally ground espresso coffee I buy when I run out."
5,"This is the only tea I have found that has a sharp orange flavor. It also has a mint flavor. I love drinking it when eating a chocolate desert. But it's good anytime. I love it."
5,"This stuff is awesome.<br /><br />I followed the recommendations from Ashley Foods ""This wing sauce possesses heat from Hell for the wildest heat-freak, but can be tempered for more civilized folk by mixing it with any favorite sauce or marinade.""<br /><br />I mixed it with Frank's and it's delicious.  I mixed about 2 parts Frank's to 1 part Mad Dog.  The next time I mixed about 3 to 1 and the last time I mixed 1 to 1.  I would let them marinade overnight.  Each time they were delicious.  I would make up a whole batch and I would only get to eat about two or three before everyone else snatched them up.<br /><br />I've only tried them with this sauce on the grill.  The first time they were on a Coleman griddle type grill.  Every time we would close the lid and open it back up we ended up coughing from breathing in the sauce.  I thought they would be unbearable, but they turned out great.<br /><br />The next two times, I cooked them on just a regular grill surface and I think a lot of the sauce burned off but they were still really spicy.  The nice thing about cooking them on the grill was that they turned out really crispy.<br /><br />I bought 8 more bottles of this stuff.  I'm going to try a baked and fried recipe to see how they turn out.  I'm also going to try different dilutions and possibly all by itself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce to anyone that likes spicy wings.  I would start off by mixing it with your favorite wing sauce first.  It's definitely potent."
5,"I have a stressful job where I work around sick people and their often unprotected coughs and sneezes.  Davidson's green rooibos tea is what I reach for at the first sign I'm coming down with something, or those times when my own immune system just feels fragile and run-down.  I make the tea strong (2 heaping teaspoons to a cup), bring it to a boil then steep at least 6 cups on the stove (lowest setting on the burner so it's just gently steaming) for a half hour to an hour.  Sometimes that's enough to knock out the oncoming cold, sometimes I stay on the tea for a few days.  Bottom line:  my coworkers have been sick this winter, most several times; I haven't been sick once.<br /><br />I sometimes drink green rooibos straight but generally mix it with either Davidson's Spring Fruit and Flowers or Davidson's Spiced Rooibos Chai.  Good luck!"
5,"I have four cats with differing tastebuds/likes.  They all enjoyed this product, and there was no waste.  The supplier sent the wrong size, the smaller 3-ounce cans, but Amazon immediately rectified this in a highly satisfactory manner.  I use the recurring order option for an additional discount, and there is no tax levied on this product (like in stores) on Amazon's site.  I would recommend this product for anyone considering it for their cat(s)"
5,"I love this product! Tasty and soft (but not too soft). Very good flavor and it's safe to say, I can't ""eat just one!"" If you like the jerky, but not the dried up, tough stuff...you might want to give this stuff a try!"
5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7VYRA"">Snyder's of Hanover Cheddar Cheese Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> package claims these pretzels are bursting with flavor. I agree with this claim, my family agrees with this claim, my son's family agrees with this claim; as a matter of fact, everyone I've shared these pretzels with agrees with this claim.<br /><br />These are hard, sourdough pretzel pieces.  I'd guess the average size is 1/2"" x 3/4"" - 1""  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken. I ordered these using Amazon's subscribe & save program which brings the price down to less than I'd pay in the supermarket. Twelve packages are a lot.

5,"I have been a fan of the Kettle Bakes for a long time now.  They truly are the best chips available anywhere.  In my opinion they are far better in every way than any brand of fried potato chips, not counting Fritos, which aren't potato chips anyway.  I don't see how they could really be improved.  The crunch is fantastic, the flavor is fantastic, and you sacrifice nothing but greasy fingers!  I have tried every flavor, and my favorite is definitely the Aged White Cheddar, but you won't see me turn my back from the BBQ, or the Lightly Salted.  The Salt and Pepper flavor is a bit peppery, so if you like that then you'll like them, and I even eat them sometimes.  The Salt and Vinegar doesn't work for me, but then I'm not a fan of vinegar potato chips anyway.<br /><br />Just buy these, please, any flavor that tickles your fancy.<br />And then you can thank me later.<br />=)"
5,"We were buying Bahlsen cookies at $1.70-$2.19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are $1.41/box here at Amazon!"
5,"My 10-month-old LOVES these and my 3 yr old even sneaks bites from them! They both think they are really tasty, and I feel good feeding them an organic product. I would DEFINITELY buy these again."
5,"I tried, and love these chips. My local store carries them at over 4 dollars each.  I save over 15 dollars on every case.  I'm trying the salt free next!"
5,"I love the shape and taste of mini pretzels like these but don't like the flavor of wheat - so this is the perfect solution. Light on salt, baked just to perfection, with the slightly nutty taste of spelt. They don't overpower anything else I'm eating or drinking, very well balanced. Thanks Newmans' Own, another winner!"
5,"We purchase some of the more mundane/normal Crystal Light flavors (e.g. lemonade) and we've been pretty happy, and were curious about this flavor. It's surprisingly refreshing, with a nice clean, crisp flavor that doesn't leave you feeling thirsty when you're finished drinking it."
5,"The Coffee Storage Drawer Holder for the 36 Keurig K-Cup Pods is wonderful.  I purchased 2 and am extremely impressed.  I have place one flavor in each of the rows.  Because I know that they are all the same flavor in that row, I flip every other cup upside down and then you can fit 7 cups in each row.  So I make my 36 k-cup holder a 42 cup holder.  They are made out of very strong metal.  I have my Cuisinart Keurig sitting on one and my Cuisinart espresso machine sitting on the other one.  It makes my coffee counter look so nice, clean, and organized.  I occasionally spill water on the top when I am pouring water into the Keurig.  The top material of the storage drawers is FABULOUS!  It is a waterproof type material.  The water just beads and sits there until you wipe it off, but because of the raised edge, the water doesn't spill onto the counter.  I just ordered another one for my office and one for a Christmas gift.  I recommend this product and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007R900WA"">Coffee Storage Drawer Holder 36 Keurig K-cup Pods by DecoBros®</a>"
5,"Special K Red Berries Cereal is my Favorite Special K cereal.  I have been eating it for years and tried all of the other varieties.  It is healthy and helps me keep my weight down with Weight Watchers."
5,"So worth the price. This is the best tea I've ever had. The aromas and flavours are so bountiful. I love this stuff."
5,"Minnesota Honey Producers tasted the honey candy at their annual meeting and found it to be extraordinarily delicious!!  The variety of flavors were great as a ""honey sweet"" treat at each table setting."
5,"Coconut oil is sensitive to light and can break down easily, so it should be packaged in a dark container (way to go Barlean's).  Also, to keep it as nutritionally rich as possible, it should be cold-pressed and Barlean's is indeed cold-pressed.  I have had flavorless and dry coconut oils, so this coconut oil delighted me--smells divine and has a lovely consistency.  Coconut oil is amazing, it can be used for cooking (it is the most stable--healthy--oil at high temperatures), baking etc. and it is excellent for your skin and your hair!  I keep a jar in my kitchen and one in my bathroom!"
5,"Not too strong, not too weak...smooth without the bitterness.  Great anytime for those not into the strong ""grow hair on your chest"" types.  We will continue to purchase this as a part of our favorite brands."
5,"These have definitely been the best flavor K-cups I have had yet.  Not too bold, but they pack a lot of that great coffee flavor - as close as I can get to when I press my own cup of coffee."
5,"I use this pickled ginger to go along with my nori rolls. The taste is exceptionally fantastic--seriously the best I have had. Organic is a huge plus, and I will continue to purchase/stock up on this. I do think that this is a product that I will begin to use more and more, simply because of its quality. The taste is more mild and pleasant than typical pickled ginger that you receive with sushi. It has a refreshing bite to it, not a weird chemical-biting aftertaste like what most everyone is used to. If you are looking for ginger for your sushi, you will not regret trying a bottle of this!"
5,"This one and the Miso noodle bow are favorites in our house.  Both are mild kid pleasers.  This one comes in at three times the calories of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E123IC"">Annie Chun's Miso Soup Noodle Bowl, 5.4-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 6)</a>  though.  Its a very hearty serving size, and is a slightly sour sauce.  My son likes an extra spoonful of peanut butter stirred in -- I totally second K Vandette's review, the quick way, start with hot water  I use our insta hot tap) microwave for a minute, stir and add the other ingredients and microwave for another 30 secs to a minute.<br /><br />Tastes great and is super fast for your kid that has to get some place with minutes to spare :-)"
5,"These were a great find!  They are tasty - natural and a great snack."
5,"Cheetos ever since I was kid were one of my favorite snacks,I mean who wouldn't like them? You can't go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try. I'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but I do like things with with a kick and since this had Jalapeno in it I was assuming it was hot...not so much. If you eat mildly hot foods this shouldn't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food. I didn't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery Jalapeno flavor. I would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane, i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag. Overall I hope they decide to keep this one, cause they are amazing. And yes girls like these kind of snacks too :)! Love!"
5,"I love pill pockets.  It makes giving my dog pills very easy.  Since I give my dog pills twice a day it's a lot cheaper to buy it online."
5,"For a sugarfree gum, this stuff is really tasty. It has an intense flavor at first that softens into a more subtle orange cream taste. It lasts pretty long, but I've had gum that's lasted longer. It'll definitely make your breath smell good though.<br /><br />This is my favorite, and probably the most accurate, of all the extra dessert flavors. The mint chocolate chip doesn't taste much like mint or chocolate to me although it is refreshing, and the strawberry shortcake is so sweet it hurts my mouth. But they definitely got this one right on the money."
5,"I use it with the estate EVOO from Il Borro (Ferragamo property near San Guistino Valdarno) which I much prefer to those recommended by the editors of the Cook's Illustrated series.<br /><br />The price and quality are fine."
5,"Sooooooooo tasty that I came to Amazon looking for more as I ate the whole bag in a week!  I LOVE the sweet/salty play of tastes of this treat!  Right now I'm ordering a bag for me and one for a good friend.  Five stars plus!"
5,"considering that a 5 oz bag sells for $1.99 in stores, this deal is a no brainer.  will be back buying another 5 lb soon."
5,"I have an 8lb chihuahua who seriously dislikes getting his paws wet or cold.<br />He used to have a pair of ""boots"" that were purchased from a chain pet store that weren't comfortable and didn't stay on well. They also caused him to really kick while he was walking. Now that's a funny sight, but he couldn't move very quickly.<br /><br />These boots are comfortable, we don't fight to get them onto him, the first time I put them on him I thought there would be an adjustment period - no. He was prancing. PRANCING. The dog who HATES boots, was PRANCING in his new boots."
5,"Every year, my grandmother would receive packages of tea from her relatives in Japan - she would pass a package or two to my mother - I loved the smell and taste when my mother would make a pot of tea with the tea - when my grandmother passed away, the tea packages stopped coming - so when I saw this Stash Premium green/white tea bags, I was excited - I decided to order it through the Subscribe & Save program and am happy I did - I'm cutting back on coffee and find this tea fills the need for a hot beverage in the morning"
5,"My doc has strictly limited me on what I can and cannot eat. I can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price. Good taste."
5,"This is exactly what i was looking for.  Just like whats served in thai restaurants...very happy and will definitely order again."
5,"these pops worked perfectly for making a candy flower pot.  the size was great  and the kids loved them.  they were packaged nicely.  no one was broken.  would order them again."
5,"These noodles are excellent! Great side dish and quick to fix! Gotta love them noodles!"
5,"Been drinking Good Earth Jasmine green tea for years.  I find green tea to be quite boring tasting, kind of like dirt or grass, so I enjoy green teas that have flavor.  Jasmine is a pleasant addition and the Good Earth is one of the best jasmine green teas I have tried.  Been buying it on Amazon for a few years now, on a subscription.  It shows up just when I'm running out, so is very convenient as well as a great price."
5,"When my doctor told me to switch from white rice to brown rice, I wasn't sure I'd like it. A friend suggested this brand. Tried it, loved it, and will order more. Being organic in addition to tasting good is a big plus."
5,"very good powdered organic product on the market...the best thing to add to a chocolate healthy shake gives that added boost to it.  Love it."
5,"I bake about 5-10 times a month.  This is the most intense chocolate I have ever used.  Even when opening the bag, the smell you are met with tells you what high quality chocolate this is.  I have already used this for two different cakes, and it provides a rich, well balanced flavor.  It is worth the investment for baking."
5,"Marley Coffee One love Organic is dark, rich and flavorful with good mouth feel and a medium roundness of tone. Not bitter, but there seems to be almost a salty undertone to it, that does speak of Jamaica and Blue Mountain although the label does not claim it is Blue Mountain coffee. These packets are about one normal scoopful, and can be used in single serving coffee makers but I put one in my 2-4 cup espresso machine and it was fantastic."
5,"This was really wonderful to sample the turkish delights and especially the rose flavor was fragrant. Elegant and pleasurable, a sweet to be savored and enjoyed. This was in a beautiful box and my whole family enjoyed this rare treat."
5,"I hate the original green tea but this one is Exceptional! Great taste! No bitter taste, very sweet. You won't regret getting a full box..plus the price is super cheap!!"
5,"I was real impressed with the pearls, They look like real ones,I would definitely recommend them to any body that needs pearls for a cake, etc.<br />Shipment was fast also."
5,"Love this product and will never buy another liquid smoke product.  The smell is incredible and matches the taste.  Highly recommend."
5,"I have been drinking Lavazza Rossa Expresso for 25 years.But I have been getting it directly from family members in Italy for the whole time.I was incredibly surprised that Amazon had it!My family is in Rome and they bring it by the dozen for me.It's so cool that now I don't have to wait for my family to go to Rome to get my expresso coffee.AMAZON RULES!"
5,"For some reason we have had tiny little black flies all over the house. I placed the strips as directed and the very next day the strips were full of the tiny little buggers. I just ordered two more packs (wish I could find just the strips) for my other plants. Im hoping to break the life cycle of the flies."
5,"Whenever I have guests over, I offer them a glass of Butterfinger cocoa.  They love it!  It really is fantastic!  My local grocer is no longer stocking this so I was SO happy to find it on Amazon!  Great deal!"
5,"This is truly a fantastic mix! My family eats gluten free food out of necessity; however extended family and friends all love this mix as well and several began using it after eating it at our house. I use milk instead of water to create extra thick pancakes (but they are great if you use water as the recipe calls for) and we just love Sunday breakfasts ever since we found this mix. Really, try it just once and you will be hooked, too!"
5,"I grabbed a bag of these at the store thinking one of our kids might like it, but I was in need of a snack for the office today and brought it with. Within only one moment or so my reaction devolved into a gluttonous orgy of OMG NOM NOM NOM NOM! There could be more pineapple and papaya but there are plenty of banana chips, which I HATED before today. Today I LOVE THEM. THEY DID SOMETHING TO THEM. WHAT???! I thought Harry Potter and Hogwarts and Dumbledore and all that was just make believe, but I'm quite sure SOMEONE SPREAD MAGIC ON THEM. They are crunchy, not chewy; they taste like bananas, not chemicals.<br /><br />Sure, there's a lotsa peanuts. And cashews too, to be fair.  Despite the shortcoming of choosing Planters' two most common nuts and nothing exotic, this is really good commercial trail mix. You could roll some awesome trail mix and beat its pants off, sure. You could put good, good stuff like figs and pumpkin seeds and coconut shavings. Yeah, you COULD, believe me regarding this. But for a fruit-n-nut trail mix from a bag labeled Planters... well, color me impressed. especially with the banana chip magic. Better patent that shiznit, Planters!"
5,"I support purchase of all Fair Trade coffee and hope that the price is will be more affordable."
5,"I hope Whiskas never stops making Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree.  It is the only wet food that I can get my cat to eat.  I've tried just about every other brand and flavor of wet cat food, and he refuses everything else.  But these pouches of tuna are different for some reason.  And Amazon's subscription service gives me a discount, and saves me a trip to the store!"
5,"This oolong tea from Dynasty is really quite excellent, better than most expensive oolong tea.  It doesn't suffer any green notes--green in the sense of not being quite ripe, as some oolong tea can.  It has a good sweet, rustic flavor.<br /><br />Note: Oolong tea is basically in between green and black tea."
5,"I have used this item and found it vary easy to use it seems to take on the flavors that you cook it with i would recomend this product to anyone, I use it for my low carb diet. It is a little hard to obtain where i am and a little costley to have it shipped i am going to my grocier to see about having it stocked on there shelfs."
5,"This candy bar is absolutely amazing!  I have not eaten candy bars in years but when I saw this I had to try it as I adore caramel and chocolate.  I like to cut it into 6 slices and freeze them in a container.  I suck on 1 or 2 in the evening as a splendid treat; lasting longer because it's frozen.  In addition, if your watching your weight you can still indulge.  Each slice is only 1 Weight Watcher point; and well worth it!<br /><br />If I could rate it a 10 I would.  You will not be disappointed; I highly recommend it to all.  Cudos to Milky Way."
5,"I have been caffeine free for a year now and I do appreciate products that are truly caffiene-free (rather than low-caffeine). This tea is as caffeine free as they come, and it has a wonderful flavor -- unlike any other Earl Grey I have tried. This is truly a winner and I will be back for more when my current stash runs out."
5,"P G Tips tea is a black tea. I am from India and am used to strong tea.. I used to have to use two Lipton bags at least to make a good cuppa, but PG Tips has solved that issue for me. We have a constant supply now and I suggest the name to all my friends."
5,"My dog has poor teeth despite yearly cleanings and daily brushing, so I am always looking for additional ways to clean her teeth.  I have tried several C.E.T. chew products and have never been disappointed.  She really likes the Veggident chews, although for her size, they are a fairly big and dense treat."
5,"i love coconut water.  Vita-Coco, Zico, One, nirvana, amy & brians, goya unsweetned (The ones where they add sugar are gross).  I've even become pretty good at opening fresh ones.  With that being said, fresh is the best but if i had to go pre-packaged, C2O is by far the best."
5,"Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately."
5,"This is the best hot sauce ever! It has the right amount of heat with tons of flavor. I have the red sauce and can't wait to try the green sauce."
5,"This bag is awesome. It has shaved several minutes off my morning routine. I can see all my makeup easily. Bag folds up well with magnetic closure. Travels well. Not good if you are someone with a lot of make up. I can fit several eyeshadows, mascara, blush, under eye makeup, two eyeliner pencils, several eye shadow brushes, q-tips, and a few other items."
5,"This is a great way for me to get breakfast when I'm in a hurry, and they taste like an iced coffee!! Yum!!"
5,"While five cats mewed insanely around my legs, I struggled to open this super sealed packet of Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna.  Although there are little notches in the thick plastic it is sealed in, they ripped off part way as I pulled on them and sprayed my face and front of my shirt with tuna juices that made my cats go even more insane.  I was finally able to get the tuna out with<br />a pair of scissors.  There was a nice size chunk of  tuna  inside that I broke up in a large bowl and it fed all six of my cats who gobbled it up  and they are fairly fussy.  I would definitely buy this for my cats since the amount was generous and  of high quality but I will use the scissors next time and avoid the facial spray of tuna juices."
5,"This is the best honey in the world. It is the only commercial honey I have found that really is raw and unstrained. The taste is incredible and when I eat this everyday I don't get sick. Incredible!"
5,"I've been using CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce and CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce for three weeks before writing a review, just to give them a good test, but there was a noticeable improvement in my hair after the first shampoo.  For several months, I had been getting hairs caught in my comb when combing out my wet hair.  After using these products for the first time, there was only one hair left behind in the comb.  After shampooing and conditioning a couple of times, there were no longer any hairs in the comb at all.  I've waited three weeks to see if these products would accumulate on the hair strands, because my fine hair just collapses under the weight of product build-up.  But there doesn't seem to be any build-up at all.  They leave my hair manageable, soft (but not limp) and very shiny.  I was surprised that neither product is clear (both are pearly in color.)  Be advised it takes very little product to work up a rich lather, so start out small and add to it or you will be rinsing for a while.  I really love both these products."
5,"Roland smoked eel fillets are absolutely delicious. If you are a smoked eel fan, you must try this. Been trying to get smoked eel at local markets (Long Island, NY) but they don't seem to be available anymore. This is a great subsitute. Recommend strongly."
5,"I agree this tastes like the Trader Joe version that I can't believe they discontinued.  It is the best sauce and I keep finding some new way to use it. I'm eating less & less meat but I know it tastes great on veggie burgers, eggs and fish. It's worth experimenting."
5,"Carli is the best olive oil I've ever used and use it exclusively now.  I use the regular and the extra virgin olive oil.  Wonderfully flavorful!"
5,"We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT."
5,"On the South Beach diet, we are not allowed rice or pasta, but we can have Quinoa, which, interestingly, is not a grain, but a berry.  In any case, it is very versatile and we have it around four times a week (have to, now that I've bought 32 pounds!).  My family loves it and that makes my life easier."
5,"Have ordered several deer antlers from different sources, this was the best value I have received based on size and cost."
5,"This is the closest you can get to actually going into a little bakery in the Middle East. These pastries are amazing. Delicious, mouthwatering and fresh. A+++"
5,"The best candy I've ever eaten!  I always request the butterscotch squares and nothing else whenever I am asked what I would like for ANY event or holiday.  I might go buy a box for my partner today.  And maybe a box for myself."
5,"This small delicious mouthwatering box of chocolate made a strong impression on its recipient, whom i sent it as a gift. The superb taste and beautiful packaging makes it a well rounded affordable item which i would highly recommend to all. Its freshness and soft scrumptious cream makes its taste a special chocolate creamy combo for all chocoholics."
5,"This is the best dried fruit product we have tried. Sweet and crunchy, totally portable, great for toting around in your bag and a super quick and easy snack. A good choice for people trying to reduce their calories because it is portion-controlled and very satisfying, as well as delicious."
5,"Veggie Pigs Ears! What could be better..My dogs love them...WHile at times not too thrilled about the real nasty pigs ears they got, this is a wonderful alternative..They go crazy for them. I have a poodle who can't tolerate the protein in real meats and she just loves these.<br />Great price from Amazon, and I'm in an area where I can't find these at my local stores. The keep fill option is the bomb! Your pups will love them"
5,"I surely enjoy the refreshing Peach tea, pricing is very good, bulk packaging works great as well.  After mixing peach tea I watch it disappear quickly with our Grand kids.  Thank you"
5,"Not much to say unless you have tried it, then you will know it's the best butter in the world."
5,"A superior product at a good price.  I highly recommend this Stevia.  No weird fillers or funny taste.  Delicious!!  And NO Carbs!!  Amazon.com delivers great products at great prices in extremely timely fashion!!  No hestitation ever in ordering from Amazon.com!! They know what they are doing and take excellent care of their customers."
5,"A colleague from the UK recommended I try shortbread during a trip to Scotland ""as they don't know how to make them 'right' anywhere else apparently."" With some reservation (I like baking, pastries, and cookies but haven't had a shortbread cookie I've liked yet), I bought a box and brought them home. My only MAJOR regret was that I did not bring a case home.<br /><br />These are without a doubt the most delectable, soft, flakey, gentle, sweet cookies/dessert/shortbread, I have ever had. Absolutely delicious with a cup of hot tea (recommend heather or thistle tea of the same Scottish flair, also Darjeeling works well). I did try a few other brands whilst in Edinburgh (Nairns - chunky, butterfilled, hard and rather gross. Walkers.. so-so). But this, this is the best of the best!"
5,"I recv'd this tea in great condition. The packing and timeliness were great. I love this tea. It takes me back to when I had our son in an Italian hospital near Pisa, Italy. They brought me Lipton Yellow Label Tea. That was many years ago and I never forgot how good it tasted or stopped looking to buy more once we left Europe. Hubby and I were talking about it and I thought of Amazon! It was right here. I'm enjoying it in the afternoon for a pick me up! Good stuff!"
5,"These are awesome! My one year old loves them and they are a much better value than the Gerber Puffs. THey also dont have all the added junk that Gerber ones do and these are Organic. We have tried Banana, Greens, and Apple flavor and she loves them all. I am so excited to have a healthier option for on the go snacks. She also loves any of the dehydrated fruit we've tried, if you're looking for other on the go healthy snacks for baby!"
5,"Home baked short bread doesnt get any easier than this.  Just cream a stick of butter, mix, and press into whatever pan you have handy.  This is as good as the shortbread I ate while living in Northern England."
5,"My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself. They ALL taste good. I would eat any of them if I was so inclined to eat a pureed meal. They are easy to pack & throw in the diaper back/suit case for travel. I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware). The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box. Happy Baby = Happy Mommy"
5,"I really love these bars.  I prefer them more than name brand candy bars and they are good for you!  They came quickly and I had no problems with signs of melting in transit as I had with other nutrition bars.  I will certainly keep buying."
5,"I've only recently discovered Twinings Lady Grey, and fell in love with it immediately. This is the tea I drink when I'm having a bad day and need some soothing and comfort, like a mother's cuddle; it always does the trick. I cannot stand earl greys in general, finding them too strong and the aroma/taste too obnoxious and perfumey (like I'm sipping a bottle of cologne). That's not the case here; the black tea base is mild, (just right, not weak), and the citrus & spices aroma is pure yumminess. (As it turns out, Twinings Earl Grey tastes almost as good, IF you let it steep for a few seconds only. The Lady Grey can steep forever and there is no problem.) I'm a bit of a loose tea snob, but not so much that I don't have some bagged teas in my collection as well. Now I'm dying to try the loose version in a tin!"
5,"Not only is this a natural no-cal sweetener, it has fiber, too!  None of the nasty side-effects of all those other no-cal sweeteners that end in ""ol."""
5,"I was really happy to see this organic paprika offered as an option in Amazon's Add-on program.  I use paprika in many ways: spice rubs, stew and goulash, sloppy joe mix, sauces, or any dish that needs a boost.  For example, it's great to sprinkle on french fries (after frying, as paprika can burn, or before I've baked them), along with salt and black pepper.<br /><br />This particular product is a ""sweet"" (not spicy or smoked) paprika, so keep that in mind when reading or creating a new recipe.  Also, since it comes in a glass bottle, I recommend keeping it in either a pantry or, as my grandmother advised, the refrigerator; sometimes light can affect the flavor of spices.<br /><br />Recommended!"
5,"Over time, I have tried to minimize the amount of salt that I use in cooking or adding to the final dish after it has been prepared.  Salt is not necessarily the healthiest part of our diets.<br /><br />However, this product adds a nice touch to dishes (used moderately). The standard salt out of the cardboard boxes is pretty bland. Grinding sea salt crystals produces a much nicer flavor enhancement.<br /><br />This is a great companion with the pepper grinder made by the same company. I still am conservative in my use of salt, but this serves my purposes in cooking much better than the normal ""out of the box"" salt."
5,"I'm NOT a cheese lover by nature.  I tried this at a neighbors and couldn't believe I liked it so much.  I went to Costco the next day and bought a 1.75lb block for $10.11.  It is now a stocked product in my fridge.  I like it as a treat with sliced apples, neighbor likes it with wine.  It's like an awesome English white cheddar with a slight sharpness yet has a sweet taste rounding it to be a ""real"" cheese (non American cheese) that I think most people will enjoy.  It's great melted on a sandwich and takes on a deeper color and well, mmmn!  Like most cheese it's best served for full flavor at room temperature.  I eat it straight from the fridge too."
5,"Excellent seasoning, easy to use packets.  I have made a large batch of paella using the entire packet contents, as well as smaller batches using part of the contents of the packet.  Taste is always excellent and authentic.  Delicious results!  I plan to try some of the recipes that come with the seasoning.  It is better priced on Amazon than any other site on the web."
5,"I've used cases of these popcorn portion packs and they are great.  The best value and ease of use in one package.  I use them in my home theater and we go through quite a bit of snacks and popcorn.  We have a Great Northern popcorn machine that has also worked flawlessly and was the best price anywhere on a good machine."
5,"This is one of my favorite Keurig cups.  I brew this with 2 - 8 oz cycles through a single cup.  WOW what a tasty cup of joe.  Dark and smoky with just the hint of an espresso edge.  I am always disappointed when I run out and realize that I have once again been drinking too much COFFEE!"
5,"These items were delivred quickly and exactly as promised.  Thank you.  Super large container and the pieces were well intact.<br />Thanks you."
5,"Nature's Way coconut oil is amazingly gentle. I was able to orally take 4 TBS daily within 2 weeks of starting this oil with no diarrhea. It brought my blood pressure down from 150/80 to 126/62. My skin soaks it up and looks younger. I eat it with my meals. It has a mild, pleasant coconut taste. It is doing many good things internally that Iam not even aware of."
5,"Great treat for all doggies, very healthy and they adore them.  Excellent and fast shipping,will buy again."
5,"This is my second time purchasing this product.  I love that it comes in a 2-pack which is very economical.  My nails have been growing like crazy since taking it! Also I tend to get very thirsty especially at night and the gelatin has helped me to feel more hydrated."
5,"I've ordered literally hundreds, probably into the thousands, of items from Amazon and this is the first review I've ever left.<br /><br />As to the logistics of the whole process: The cheese was incredibly well-packaged, and I had a question that I shot them right after ordering (the 1 lb.) and it was answered a couple hours after I sent it to them. The customer service was fantastic.<br /><br />The actual quality of the cheese was unbelievable. Absolutely superb. If I could give this more than a 5 star rating I would...  The taste is unreal. The Reypenaer itself arrived vacuum sealed, in a package with cold gel packs, and the external packaging was so secure a 300lb. postal worker could've sat on it and it wouldn't have been damaged.<br /><br />It's rich and has a definite smoothness (even before you eat it you can almost tell it will - it has fine crystallizations as it should with this grade of aged genuine Dutch Gouda.) Creamy with several layers of taste... from caramel to a buttery fruit taste that's impossible to describe without actually having it. Thin slices over a decent dark bread while drinking a glass of good IPA (or 10) - insanely great. If you're into gourmet cheese, this is a 100% safe bet. The same bread with the same beer with a thin slice of this Reypenaer but also lightly dipped or drizzled with a killer EVOO (like Bariani,) awesome. Sipping an awesome Scotch (like Macallan) splashed with equal parts luke water and slices of this over good bread, equally as insanely great.<br /><br />This is the first item I've ever ordered that exceeded my expectations to this degree, so I'm tossing my review in here. Believe me; you can't go wrong ordering it."
5,"I am so glad that a decaf chai is available that doesn't taste like dirt. This is so wonderful in the evening before bed or when I'm reading a book (which is every day). I like it as much as I like decaf Starbucks lattes. Thank you Bigelow for thinking of those who can't have caffeine but still want the flavor of chai."
5,"I've never tried this brand of chocolate before. I prefer semi-sweet so this was a real treat to be able to try it out. Everyone's taste is a little different so let me describe the flavor as very close to Nestle's Semi-sweet morsels used in chocolate chip cookies. Scharffen Berger is just a little bit sweeter (not quite the sour bite I'm used to).<br /><br />I did not taste the honey but I did have an aftertaste of citrus. Its hard to describe. Its like if you eat a fresh ripe strawberry, after a few chews you get a little twang after you notice the sweetness.<br /><br />Good chocolate is expensive so I think the price is reasonable at around $3 per 3 ounce bar. Although there is a cross-cut design on the top, it does not help if you want to make specific sized pieces."
5,"I can't get enough of this stuff.  The little touch of sea salt perfectly sets off the dark chocolate!  And at only 159 calories for 1/3 of the bar, it's a calorie bargain if you can keep from eating the whole bar!"
5,"This hot chocolate does not have the strongest flavor, but it is incredibly creamy and smooth. Definitely worth the price for that much."
5,"We always feed our Boston Terrier this brand of wet food....she likes a variety and this fits the bill since each packet has either beef or chicken in either sauce or gravy. She loves to eat them."
5,"My dog loves them. They make giving pills so easy.  I would recommend them to anyone who has pets. I will definitely purchase them again."
5,"my wife is a ginger fan and she loves this tea, has at least a cup a day. i'm not a ginger fan so i can take it or leave it"
5,"I ordered these to help in the training of my two dogs. They are great because they are small and they dissolve shortly after the dogs get them in their mouths. No waiting for them to chew during training. They were exactly what I wanted, and ordered, and were shipped out right away. I had them within a few days of placing the order. I would order from them again."
5,"Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that ""crunch"" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)"
5,"These treats are my picky cat's favorite.  I've tried about 8 different brands in the past and these are always the preferred kind.  Highly recommended!"
5,"I'm not much of a pretzel person, but these are perfect!!  I'm always hesitant with these types of products that are Gluten Free, but I thought I would try it and I am soo happy I did! Great crunch that I miss and no weird after taste.  Love these and will buy then again!"
5,"I have used this coffee in the past, so I knew in advance that it was a good product. In fact, it was originally given to me as a gift by a friend from Turkey."
5,"I bake a lot (A LOT!) and this has been the best yeast, and the best value, I've found. I store the yeast in a glass jar in the freezer and take out what I need when I need it."
5,"This is really good bread. It is so soft and easy to slice for sandwiches. I love it as toast with a little butter and honey."
5,"After scouring every store in town for orange peels and not finding anything satisfactory I turned to the online options.<br /><br /> I received the candied orange peels today and I found exactly what I was looking for. The peels are perfect for the fruit cake I plan to bake. The peels are not crystallized with sugar which is great  I like the texture and the taste of the peels and I am gonna order another box soon."
5,"Patsys sauce (marinara, pizziola, vodka and all others) is thick, rich and flavorful.  There is no better product on the market today."
5,"This is quite a bar - natural (only 3 ingrediants!  No corn syrup!) it tastes great, fills you up, and is a perfect lunch or breakfast.<br /><br />Don't hesitate - these are a great support to a healthy lifestyle."
5,"Just amazing, great tasting snacks.  Bought them as a gift for my wife as she loves Huckleberry, she let me try one, but only one, if that tells you how good they are!"
5,"This is about the only green tea product that does not come with all the extra packaging.<br />The tea is in round paper bags with no strings or additional paper.  I use this tea to make iced tea and I put in one Tetley black tea bag to make the tea a little stronger.  It is a great tasting tea."
5,"I own one picky Siamese who will not eat anything but Newman's Organics Chicken and Brown Rice formula.<br /><br />That is the recommendation...If Rheeboot eats it, it must be good!"
5,"I purchased 4 of these and caught about 20 voles. My lawn finally is hole free! Purchase these in pairs so you can put one facing each direction in the vole run."
5,"This toy takes more effort to get food out than the Buster Cube, which I like because it occupies the dog longer.  I find that the cube, even on its ""hardest"" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it.  With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.<br /><br />At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full.  This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side.  This will encourage the dog to play with it.  Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle.  It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it.  She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out.  When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has.  Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day."
5,"The ""Jalapeno Smokehouse"" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!"
5,"These gluten free brownies are so good (especially with dark chocolate frosting) that even my friends and family who eat wheat request that I bring<br />them to all functions!"
5,"Both my wife and I insist on a hearty decaf.  I use Coffee Bean Direct all the time and this decaf is on par with their Sumatra decaf which is best so far.  Will definitely keep on the buy list for future use."
5,"Now that we've moved to a more remote area, we can't find quality cat food in the local shops. I was fortunate to find this cat food on Amazon. We have 4 kitties. One doesn't digest fish well (she must be part Maine Coon--I hear ""Coons"" have trouble with fish) but handles this product just fine. I like that Innova EVO doesn't use corn, which is just empty filler in cat food that leads to excess weight gain and chronic ailments. I will continue to buy this product from the seller."
5,"Our family finds this salmon jerky to be the best and most authentic.  Jerky does mean it's dried, but the flavor and nutrition is still there.  It's delicious and nutritious....simply awesome!"
5,"This is one of our very favorite sauces for many meals. It is great for meats, egg dishes, cassaroles and other applications.  We have bought this by the case in the past! Glad we can still purchase it."
5,"I have two small dogs who have [[ASIN:B00139ZPKM Newman's Own<br />#0174;Organics Advanced Dog Chicken & Rice Formula, 12.5 Pound Bag]]  Their only treats were Cheerios.  When I switched to Newman's Own brand, I was pleasantly surprised to notice they stopped their occasional vomiting.  With all the trouble caused by lack of standards in the industry, I immediately thought ""if I can't trust Paul Newman's foods, whose can I trust"".  And, they love it."
5,"I started using the extra virgin coconut oil and I am very pleased with it. I use for my hair, as a lotion and I put it in my cereal.  I also saw an improvement in my health. It is a great product.  What else can I say, My only complain that it be prefered if the container was glass rather than plastic."
5,"Not sure about the ""thin"" issue but these bars are very tasty for those necessary ""snack"" times.  I do find it difficult to eat just one because they taste GREAT!!!!<br />Definitely try these!"
5,"Ok this is a tea bag coffee. Really you expect Great move right along. But good these were surprisingly better than expected. We'll freeze the extra bags we don't use now to keep fresh over time. Backpack, camping and yes on the train in motel rooms etc. Used one of those little nify metal rods that heat coffee in the cup with a travel mug that's silcone coated outside and stainless inside and the heater fits just right. No trouble bumping around in train car either. Boils water in 3 minutes about and added the coffee bag to the boiling water before removal of the rod. Then unplug rod and cooled it under water faucet and repack it and capped the travel mug with it's lid after removal of the bag. Worked so slick....we did just love it...New thing for us anyway."
5,"My cat absolutely loves this food. Not to mention, after being on it for a year, she's lost 2 pounds, her coat looks unbelievable, she hardly ever has hairballs anymore, her bowels are healthy, and her eyes are clear as day. She's 13 years old and my vet cannot believe she really is, because she looks so good. He asked me at her annual exam what I've been feeding her! I will say, it smells AWFUL, but it really doesn't matter how it smells to me, she sure seems to love it."
5,"This is exactly what I was looking for-- just the right size, sturdy and holds to capacity. It's great that the machine can sit on top of it and save space. Love it!"
5,"I can have chips around for ages...but not these suckers--once I start, I'll eat half a bag and it's gone in a day or two! I haven't eaten the chemically-laden version in years...but remember the neon orange junk that got stuck on my fingers. Robert's Pirate Booty is just delicious and addictive. You have been warned!"
5,"This pasta is delicious and is a nice, healthy alternative to refined flour pasta products. I found this purchase to be of good value."
5,"These corn chips are crispy and taste great. And very few broken chips in the bag (I like my chips whole). I just wish they weren't blue. Why would they go to the trouble of dying them blue?"
5,"My adult daughter is ""into"" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea ""the old fashioned way"".  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future."
5,"Earl grey is my favorite tea and this one comes with individually wrapped tea bags."
5,"Werthers is the best candy I ever tasted. I have become addicted to it. It is the only candy I eat!!!"
5,"I have been taking this juice now for a few years. I would not be without it! Goji Gold gives me energy and makes me feel good. It also has lots of antioxidants in it which are good for you. I take one ounce each morning on an empty stomach. That's all I need to feel good and have energy."
5,"I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free ""bought"" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a ""case"" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual ""off taste"" that I've found in other cookies - there is no ""off taste"" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them ""yummy""!"
5,"I bought this both for myself and as a gift.<br /><br />The giftees love it. I am less enthusiastic but it is not the tea's fault. I am just not a fan of redbush tea. However, my giftee persons asked me to get more."
5,"I like the veggie dip and the garden tomato flavors best but I think my little one would eat any of them.  He loved the puffs and now the crunchies.  They are a perfect size for getting him to feed himself but they can get messy.  Even when they get stale, he loves them.  It's a good snack for him and definitely a little overpriced, but Amazon has them cheaper than any store in my area. And I'm as a first time mom, I'm a sucker for any baby related foods that seem healthier than what my nephews are eating."
5,"These cookies are great! I did not think that I would find anything that even remotely come close to oreo, but they do. Actually, I like these better. You can eat as many as you want and not get sick. Try that with  non-organic cookies. When eating organic cookies, you actually taste the quality. You will not get a sugar rush (headache) like the rest."
5,"I've always been afraid of eating cheese puffs because they are ""bad for you"".  However with Barbara's Bakery BAKED Cheese Puffs you can ""have you cake and eat it too"" so to speak :-)."
5,"We use this food for our two Welsh Corgis.  One has food allergies so he can't have any chicken.  The other has a slightly sensitive stomach so the non-baked version of this didn't work for her.  The food is about a half inch in diameter so it forces them to chew rather than gulp it down like they tend to like to do even for smaller dogs. They love it.  We think it's a better grade than most non-super-premium foods without all of the hype.  They're skin and coats are perfect with this food too.  This is on my regular re-order list."
5,"I had read about the healing powers of Manila honey but did not believe it till I tried this product. I had a cough which healed because of this. Would recommend it for everyone"
5,"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."
5,"I like Wrigley's Spearment gum.  It has a very nice minty taste. It is a little stiffer than some gums so I like to combine it with Wrigley's Doublemint. Amazon was a good place to buy this."
5,"Our puppy loves Sergeant Sniffers Puppy Treats.  He goes wild for them.  We have tried a number of other dog treats and the Sniffers are far and away his favorite!"
5,"we love the WHOLE O's....gluten-free and easy on the digestive system.  A  good finger food for older babies and toddlers....move over Cheerios !!"
5,"Betty Lou's fruit bars are a great take-along snack for those on a gluten free diet.  All varieties have tasted great & good to put in your purse for a pick-me-up during the day!"
5,"Don't know what the other reviewers are drinking but this soda is great. Love the Cola and Dr. Becker's (like Dr. Pepper, a little different and without the cloying sweetness). It doesn't have the fizz of say Pepsi, but neither does Coke. And I love a good fizzy soda, and this has enough fizz for me and great taste. It's hard to find where I live, and the only store selling it just closed, so I'm moving to buying it on-line, that's how much I like it."
5,"They stopped selling this at Walmart which made me sad but then I found it on amazon which made me glad. You have to buy in bulk but (going by the ones that I received) they don't expire for over a year so as long as you store it correctly you should be able to buy in bulk even if it's a small household like mine."
5,"""Fog Chaser""...a great description! Extremely fresh. The taste is surprisingly deep and rich for a medium roast, or ""Full City."" I usually drink a darker roast just to get the extra bit of flavor, but this one is even better than San Francisco Bay's French Roast. The only other coffees that come close are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q822L0"">Brooklyn Bean Roastery ""Fuhgeddaboudit""</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q82652"">""Cyclone,""</a> two of my other favorites, along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I5DM"">Green Mountain Revv</a>.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these are ""pods"" rather than actual k-cups, so after you open the bag, you will need to seal the unused capsules in a zip bag, preferably in the refrigerator (not the freezer). Doing this, I've never had the coffee go stale. If you like deep, flavorful coffee, I recommend you give this one a try."
5,"I prepared a package of this flavorful rice tonight for dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I used my rice cooker for the full package and it turned out perfect.  Just the rice mix, water, salt and a tad of butter.  Absolutely irresistible.  We didn't stop until we finished the last grain.  I can't wait to try the other varieties.  It is definitely worth the expense.  A much better deal here on Amazon than I can find locally.<br />Try it, you'll be glad you did!"
5,"Breath Savers-Spearmints are the best sugar free mints I have come across so far. While on holiday in US I was looking for the same and that too in bulk quantity as I wanted to carry back home. I was able to get a few pieces at a drug store and I checked at Amazon and was able to order the desired quantity."
5,"It took me a long time to try these larabars out and I don't know what really prompted me to try one finally but I am so glad I did.  From the flavors that I have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department.  I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon."
5,"Chia seeds are considered a ""Superfood,"" which means that they contain a very high density of nutrients. Chia provides you with complete protein, ALL essential amino acids, as well as essential vitamins and trace minerals. A great antioxidant source, chia provides high levels of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and flavanol glycosides. These are all polyphenols that maintain proper function of bodily organs and tissues and that protect against cancer and cardiovascular disease through the removal of damaging free radicals. Chia is a phenomenal whole food for any diet.<br /><br />I'd purchased chia seeds in the past and they normally came as a mixture of light and dark seeds. I figured I would try these white chia seeds in order to see if there was any difference in taste and/or nutritional value. White chia seeds appear to have slightly less fat than the standard chia mixture (3g to 4.5g). Other values are essentially the same, such dietary fiber, carbs and protein, but white chia has more potassium at 60mg per serving. I was not able to decipher any distinguishable difference in taste between these white chia seeds and the darker ones I'd had in the past.<br /><br />I usually add these seeds to oatmeal, but other options include smoothies, yogurt or even baked goods. What I have yet to try is soaking the seeds in water, which creates a ""gel"" that can essentially be added to any recipe."
5,"I bought these for my mom and she loves it.  She mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate.  She enjoyed melting pepermint candies in too."
5,"HI-CHEW is my personal all time favorite candy.  It's all about the texture.  It's almost like a cross between a starburst and a gummy bear.  Soft and chewy, but not like stick to your teeth chewy.  And the flavors are awesome.  They taste more like real fruit flavors instead of being over the top sweet with and imitation fruit flavor.  I've loved this candy ever since a friend went to Japan and brought some back.  And I would buy it every time I got lucky and stumbled upon it in a random liquor store or japan town.  I'm just so glad I can find it on amazon now and buy it in bulk whenever I want!  :)"
5,"When we first buy this, we want to make the soup, but actually we just eat as it after opening. it taste good even without cooking. we like the texture. now we use it for salads as well. So definitely a five starts."
5,"My son absolutely loves these Mango pouches. Definitely his favorite. I have been feeding these to him since he was 6 months old. He is almost a year now and still loves them. Organic, just a plus! Highly recommend this product, especially for travel."
5,"When I first found my dog at a shelter I started feeding her eukanuba and a few other mainstream brands. Then, I decided to start organic foods. I tried several different brands until I found this. Great ingredients, trusted by MANY pet stores, and my dog LOVES IT! I've tried the lamb, chicken and whitefish flavors. She loves them all. Price is on par with most stores as well! she is now 12 years old and still going strong!"
5,"I love sour cream and onion chips, but don't love the all the junk in them. These are a great alternative and taste super delicious. I'll never go back to eating regular chips/goldfish.  These ROCK!"
5,"Excellent treat for cats. My cat wakes up just by the noise of the plastic bag. Very useful when I'm looking for him, I just have to shake the Whiskas Temptations bag."
5,"If you can get one at the store first, obviously try it before ordering a 16 pack.<br /><br />This is the plain Jocalat bar and I can say I am hooked.<br /><br />We gave up processed sugar and are going the organic route on everything. And this is perfect for a chocolate fix. It's great because there is no added sugar (or sugar substitute) unless you count figs.<br /><br />If you are addicted to the fat (butter) and sugar of the majority of candy bars, this is different.<br /><br />Tastes what I remember a brownie to be like except less sweet.<br />When you get off sugar, your tastebuds change. It's worth it though. Some other people, if they are referring to this actual flavor, probably are thinking it isn't sweet enough.<br /><br />Did not care at all for the orange flavored one. Haven't tried the mint. Coffee/hot variety goes against what I'm doing health wise. I'm alright with pure chocolate though. I think this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />------<br />UPDATE: Haven't eaten these in a long time. I am finding I do better with soaked nuts. I also prefer to eat as close to 100% organic as I can."
5,"I love this product and am happy that I can get automatic ship on it.  I can't find a store in Boulder that carries it."
5,"For our fourth child, we had to begin the formula adventure.  Never before did we need this, but adopting a 5 month old changes things!  Looking at the label on the formula he was on when he came, we were utterly shocked and dismayed that the first ingredient was ~42% corn-sugar solids.  In a baby formula!!<br /><br />Having a holistic approach to health and a strong emphasis on sustainable, organic agricultural production, we have long been fans of Earth's Best other children products.  This formula continues their tradition of quality produce.<br /><br />Opening the other cans, the smell was certainly less than pleasant.  Peeling back the lid on the Earth's Best formula, it actually smells like something I would enjoy consuming - it smells like food for people!<br /><br />Certainly, formula isn't cheap, but in the foundational years of infancy, every ounce of nourishment is important.  Thanks to Amazon & the subscribe and save option, the price for this wonderful formula is on par or cheaper than the alternatives at the local stores (walmart & the like).<br /><br />As far as formula goes, it certainly shouldn't be the first choice if the option to breast feed exists.  If that isn't a possibility, this should be at the top of your list as the next best thing."
5,"4 cups boiling water<br />2 tbsp of this paste<br />1/4 cup brown sugar<br />1 tbsp lemon juice<br /><br />perfect cooler for any occasion"
5,"When I found out about this product from Jorge Cruise's site, I couldn't wait to try it.  It took many visits to specialty stores (names obtained from the Zevia website) before I finally found one that had just two cans of the Ginger Root Beer in stock.  I bought both cans, even though I never really drink root beer.  After tasting Zevia Ginger Root Beer, I love root beer now!  This is my favorite flavor, even over Cola and Orange (haven't had the Twist, yet).<br /><br />Everything in the Ginger Root Beer is natural, and there's no caffeine (like the Cola, even though it's supposed to be natural caffeine). The cola is  my next favorite that I have occasionally.  I did not care much for the orange, it tasted artificial and not very orangy-tasting. I highly recommend the root beer flavor, though."
5,"Nice aroma and is a great breakfast blend.  Strong enough but without the harsh after taste."
5,"I love Lara Bars - all of them.  It's amazing that they have so few ingredients but taste so good.  I even like the chocolate Lara Bars better than a real chocolate bar ... plus you get good nutrition from these bars and don't have to worry about strange ingredients or additives.  My husband and I buy these 4 cases at a time ..."
5,"This stuff really helps you heal your muscles.  Don't waste your money on the over priced P90X stuff, buy this instead."
5,"Nantucket is my husband's favorite K-cup coffee. He has a Keurig coffeemaker at work and at home.<br />You can't beat the convenience and taste."
5,"Of the flavored Hazelnut Coffee out there.  The Green mountain one has been the best.  I have tried a ton of different companies and I highly recommend this one.  Also Amazon is the cheapest price I found to get this Coffee."
5,"These bars taste very good.  I am a big fan of them.  I use these as my morning pick me up."
5,"I loved eating this soup growing up in CA.  I haven't lived in CA for many years and had not seen this soup in Colorado, until recently. Unfortunately, the store I found it at only carried it for a short time.  Thank Goodness for Amazon!  Found it on Amazon no problem and ordered 2 cases!  This soup may not be for everyone but my teenage daughters who had never eaten it before tried it recently, reluctantly and they both loved it! This soup is low calorie, no fat, high protein and filling. No wonder my health nut 70's mom loved this stuff! Pretty close to perfect I'd say!"
5,"These were shipped out the day after I ordered them and arrived within 5 days.  (I live on the opposite coast where these are made.)  My order arrived nicely packaged.  For the price, I got 1 lbs. 4 oz. of biscotti (I weighed it on my kitchen scale) cut into 10 big pieces.  Add the shipping and handling, and that comes out to a little more than $2 per piece.  This is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too (when they have some.)  So, I guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days?<br /><br />The flavor is very almondy. And, the hardness is just perfect.  The biscotti is hard and crunchy, but it's not so hard that you couldn't eat it without dunking (as some biscotti are).  This biscotti can be eaten ""as is"" or can be dunked in coffee, tea or cocoa.  I dunked mine in Chai Tea and it tastes great.  And, the biscotti does not fall apart when dunked.<br /><br />I like the almond flavor, but I wish this came in anise flavor.  That's my favorite biscotti flavor."
5,"My dog loves these as he does all of Stella and Chewy's- the dog food and the dog treats.  I love that it is human food quality and good for him.  Only downside is that it is expensive"
5,"Excellent quality, no added fat, beautifully prepared.  Add a rich tomato flavor to my pizza toppings, pasta sauces, salad, etc."
5,"This Lucky Country Licorice is some of the best we've tried. It's rich tasting, soft and not too sweet. The 15 pound bulk container was a great buy and arrived fresh at our door in just a few days."
5,"I get these at truck stops across the country - always good, though hard to stop before the box is empty."
5,"I started buying this a few years ago at a local health food store in small baggies... I couldn't get enough!  It's a delicious addition to any soups and sauces.  So glad I can buy it in bulk now!  I'm a vegetarian so a lot of broth powders are less than flavorful, but this one hits the spot."
5,"I got hooked on these after flying and finally decided to order some.  This was about the best price I found and the cookies arrived fresh and in great shape."
5,"The last couple of months I've been buying the Terra Blue chips, in the small bags,  Which is such a good idea, I like the fact I know how many calories i am eating,  Well, Amazon was out of the Terra Blue so I thought I  would give these a try and I am glad I did, They're very good,  I like the variety of different chips in the bag, all which are yummy.  Very yummy,  And a super alternative to potato for those of us who are encouraged to rotate our foods,  I'll definitely be reordering these,  They're my favorite now,"
5,"It's sad that most food based Hemp products come from outside the USA. But this is not a political review, but rather a quality review of a very enjoyable product. Since I eat a very strict Paleo eating regimen seeds and nuts are a large part of my daily routine. When I bake chicken, or make a big salad I always sprinkle on Hemp Seeds. The taste is not overpowering and it seems that Nutiva's quality is by far the best and most consistent. Another great selling point is that it is available through Prime. I'm not going to get on a soap box about the health benefits of Hemp, go look it up and do your own research. I enjoy this food and have for many years."
5,"These are amazing and unable to consistently find in the Atlanta area . . . so rather than continue driving around looking for them, I found them at Amazon.com.  Thanks Amazon - and Mrs. Leeper's!  I prefer corn spaghetti over rice and this brand is THE BEST.  Only other tip to offer, let water boil VERY HOT with a smidge of oil before dropping pasta in and there will be no sticking.  Also, other brands may break down while leftover in the fridge if mixed with other ingredients.  Mrs. Leeper's won't!"
5,"Sent three flavors of Spam as a joke to our sons Fraternity House where most had not even heard of the product, other than in their email, and it turned out to be a big hit. All the boys are hooked and Spam is no longer a dirty word with them. The Hickory Smoke was their favorite followed by the Low Salt Spam. We sent them a waffle iron, waffle mix and real Vermont maple syrup to round out a breakfast. We got 30 thumbs up from them and requests for more."
5,"Both of my mixed terrier dogs prefer this treat above all others. One of my dogs whines and scratches at the cabinet where these are stored wanting some!"
5,"ive been looking for a melon syrup to add to my homemade green tea frappucinos (like starbucks) and so glad i found this one!  starbucks uses torani, which is now discontinued.  this tastes exactly like it so its a great replacement!  and a great price for a HUGE bottle"
5,"My husband was a pro cyclist and swears by Cytomzx it is always his drink of choice for long rides."
5,"When i use some other deodorants, especially those super scented ones, my arm pits tend to get itchy and irritated.  I tried this deodorant specifically because of the non-irritating aloe claim.  Their claim is accurate, I love this deodorant because it keeps me dry with NO irritation.  It also smells pretty good, if i want to load up on scents i'll just add some cologne."
5,"I like everything about Zuke's treats - the ingredients, no artificial stuff, and they're made in the USA.  They're a good (healthier) alternative to the stuff you can typically find in most retail stores.  They cost more by weight, but they're not really expensive either.  (If you try some and like them, stock up in bulk on Amazon because they're eligible for the free shipping, too!)  And they actually do last a long time - each pound box is a big supply because the treats are small, and my puppy doesn't care that they're small, he just loves eating them.<br /><br />I started using Zuke's Mini Naturals treats when my English Setter puppy was right around 7-8 weeks old when we started training simple obedience, then a few weeks later I ordered the Zuke's Mini Bakes as well.  As far as training goes, I agree with the reviewers who said that it is better to use a small moist treat for early training, as the dog can swallow it quickly and not take extra time to chew it up.  If the puppy is small in size or young, use a moist treat.<br /><br />For a larger puppy that's a little older, these mini bakes work fine for training.  My dog is now 5 months old and ~40 lbs. but he's still a puppy, and he can eat these quickly enough that they are a good training reward.  I still break them in half to make them smaller and make the box last longer.  They're scored across the middle so they break in half pretty easily.<br /><br />We've tried both the Turkey n' Taterz flavor and the Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz flavor.  He loves both.  He was a little hesitant to eat the biscuit the first time I offered it.  He sniffed, dropped it on the floor, and sniffed some more before eating it... after tasting it, he gobbled them readily, and continues to enjoy them.<br /><br />If you're wondering just how big these are... ""mini"" is correct.  They measure about 2cm long and 1cm wide, or about 7/8ths in. by 7/16ths in.  Small, but effective.  Recommended."
5,"A while ago, a friend sent me a small package of ghost chilies. On a lark, I added some to homemade BBQ sauce and it was a hit. I ordered these ghost chilies when I ran out.<br /><br />They're hot. Even dried out, exercise caution when handling. Usually I don't use gloves; but one night I made a big batch with lots of chilies. After about fifteen minutes of handling ghost chilies, my hands started burning. Even using milk, water, and bleach - my hands burned for about 6 hours.<br /><br />Besides the heat, they add a nice subtle flavor. As long as you're careful, these are really great chilies."
5,"Pamela's gluten-free bread mix is the best I've tried so far. I was even buying a loaf of g-f bread from a dedicated g-f bakery. It was good, but Pamela's is much softer and holds together well. It does not dry out after a few days like some of the rice breads I've tried. It also holds up well to freezing. So I can make a couple of loaves at a time and keep one on hand in the freezer."
5,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten ""red apples"" before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with ""red apple"" flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this ""red apple"" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this ""red apple"" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD."
5,"My cats loved this catnip. and their very fussy. It was fresh, and I got it fast. I will order it again.<br />I reccomend it highly."
5,"After being diagnosed with Celiac disease, I looked for food that was gluten free.  I found the Bakery On Main's Gluten Free Granola at my local Walmart. I was desperate for something to snack on during the day, so I bought a bag.  That was three years ago and I am addicted to the product.  There are several flavors and I enjoy them all but my favorite is Nutty Cranberry Maple. Read the label on the front--It is so good for you.<br /><br />Because the store doesn't stock a large supply and runs out quickly, I always buy all they have every time I shop.  Finally I broke down and went to the website and found that I could order it from the source at a much lower cost that charged at the supermarket.  I order 6 bags every month and love it so much that I run out before the next shipment arrives. I may have to increase my order!"
5,"We love this rice.  I've been using it for years but for some reason my local grocery store no longer carries it.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon (and where else would one look?). It's not cheap but it really is good! It has an amazing subtle pecan flavor....for additional flavor add a small amount of ground pecans and butter and salt and you've got a wonderful side dish."
5,"It's sugar-free!  This coffee-mate adds a sumptuous taste to any coffee whether it is flavored or not. The vanilla and caramel mix is lite but delicious! This product is really good and, once again, is sugar-free--a plus for the flavor."
5,"The Two Leaves & a Bud brand tea is simply awesome. I tried some other varieties at a local coffee shop but this is the first time I tried the earl grey and it didn't disappoint. The flavor is just right and is not overpowering. As others have noted, you may want to steep it longer than the suggested time."
5,"This is some of the best flavored coffee I've ever had, and I have lived in 5 different east and west coast locations.  True the shipping box is not gift ready or pretty to look at but those coffee jewels inside makes it more than worth the purchase.  You and you're guests will be more than overjoyed with the flavor you taste.  Have ordered sampler box and a specially flavor tailored box.  Making a 3rd order today.  Give your tastebuds a coffee reward, you'll be back for more."
5,"I am going to have to purchase more of this product.  My westie, who is very finicky, loves these treats.  My recent rescue (shihtzu) loves them too!!! I am grateful that they are made in the USA.<br /><br />Thank you for a great product.  I will definitely be back!<br /><br />Sabrina"
5,"Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas!<br /><br />This tea is incredibly fragrant, smelling like spring lavender and bergamot. Has a light citrus taste and lavender over tones.<br />Great color when steeped.<br /><br />Can become bitter very quick is steeped excessively, for stronger tea add for tea leaves, don't overstep."
5,"After a long day of work, add water, 5 minutes later, dinner is done. How easy is that! Compare to other soft noodles (e.g. ramen) and its usual flavored content, this totally worth the price. The broth is light and tasty. I especially like thick and chewy udon noodles. I believe JFC Udon Bowl also has a Curry flavor Udon variety, that one is very salty, not great tasting as this one."
5,"I like it - it is fairly light compared to some I tried.  I did notice that you can get it from Giant Foods Supermarkets (Mid Atlantic Chain) for 3 clams per box if you want to try it before ordering so many."
5,"This is an excellant product.  Better than I have found in grocery stores.  Very good and crispy.  Perfect for my diet."
5,"I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir"
5,"I love this tea! Not only is it good for your immune system but it helps acheive a clear complexion which is why i bought it in the first place. It also is a powerful antioxidant! I highly recommend it if you're looking for beauty on the inside and out!"
5,"Walkers cookies have been around for a very long time.  I purchased them because I saw them listed and they were simgle serving.  These are great to stick in my lunch bag.  Great with tea or coffee!"
5,"I don't eat eggs, so oatmeal is my warm comfort food of choice for breakfast.  Maple Brown Sugar is one of my ""go to"" flavors - it disappears from the variety pack first and it's the one I seek out at the store (along with apple).  I'm also big on cutting costs at the grocery store, so I avoid name brands that aren't truly worth the extra money.  So, the important thing for me is how this oatmeal compares to the cheap stuff.<br /><br />There really is no comparison.  The store brands are a real disappointment.  The oats don't absorb the water properly.  The flavoring doesn't dissolve.  The texture is like someone threw confetti in hot water that was used to boil okra.  The taste is the cloying side.  On the other hand, Quaker absorbs the water, the flavoring dissolves, the texture is nicely bumpy and three-dimensional, and the brown sugar is just enough.<br /><br />Don't go cheap on oatmeal or you'll be sorry.  If you want to save a buck on your oatmeal, buy the real stuff in bulk on Amazon."
5,"I receive my cookies today and I though my dog would knock me down to get to them! He could not wait to open that bag and munch away! He loves to eat but this was more than the usual reaction to treats. He loved every single crumb and I will definitely be ordering more! Thanks for making such a great product!"
5,"Let me start by saying I like French roast, pressed coffee. I was purchasing 1 lb. S***bucks French roast and having it ground for the press weekly. This coffee, GM Double Black Diamond (k-cup) and Gevalia Dark Italian Roast (Tassimo)come so close I do not purchase the ground coffee any longer. Very strong, full bodied coffee without being bitter or having an aftertaste. If you like strong, fresh coffee this is it."
5,"When I first tried this product, I wasn't thrilled...the sauce was a bit gritty and clumpy...and REALLY strong.<br /><br />But I've found the solution.  Add extra dairy substitute (I use unsweetened rice milk) to thin the sauce out a bit and stir CONSTANTLY to prevent clumping.  Add 1/2 a bag of frozen peas to the pasta when cooking...and then once it's completed...refrigerate it overnight, and microwave the next day.  That is the secret.  The sauce has time to rest and becomes creamy and develop a mild, cheesy flavor.  I really recommend this!"
5,"I am very happy with this coffee!  It works great in my Keurig and the flavor is awesome!  I can brew an extra large cup without losing flavor and the price is right.  I subscribe to automatic deliveries and I normally avoid doing that."
5,"I am the mom of a recently diagnosed celiac kid.  This was my first time baking anything gluten free and I have to say this is fabulous! I made Ghirardelli chocolate chip cookies following the directions on the package, just substituting Namaste flour for the regular and they came out great! My husband cannot believe they are gluten free!  I am so happy to find this product and I will be using it in all my recipes that call for regular flour.  I threw out my bag of gold medal flour and am now confident I can bake gluten free! I can't wait to try other products from this maker."
5,"No complaints. My dogs both enjoy them and they have nice breathe afterwards. My dogs are 10 pounds each and I got the Teenies. They are very chewy so it takes a bit for my dogs to eat them, but I think that is part of the fun for them. Highly recommend!"
5,"The combination of ginger, pepper and sarsaparilla is delicious and distinctive. This tea gives me energy without the negative side effects of caffeine. It's good any time, although I especially enjoy it for an afternoon lift."
5,"The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree."
5,"I put a little spoonful of this on top of my dogs' serving of dry Happy Hips kibble. They go nuts for it. Even my picky JRT gobbles it down. The Nature's Variety has a ""people food"" smell that I think appeals to them. The ingredients are healthy and you get a good ratio of meat to gravy in each can. Some other canned foods have so much gravy that you don't really get your money's worth."
5,"My husband and I travel a lot and this is the best thing to take with us in the US and international.  It is so much easier to just heat water and add a packet of coffee than use what is offered in hotels.  We also love it in the afternoons if we need just a one-cup pick me up! We love it!!!"
5,"Used this to treat/train my dog, she seems to love it! and with the amount it comes in, it will last me a while!"
5,"I have tried a lot of different arthritis supplements for my small dogs, but this one is the best product I have found for the price.  My dogs love it and it is wonderful to see them running around where before they could hardly move for the pain.  Granted, they are old (one is 17 and one is 13) but I believe this product has given them a better quality of life, which, after all, is exactly what we want for our pets."
5,"This is my favorite flavor.  I love them and never get tired of them.  They never upset my stomach like regular chips can sometimes."
